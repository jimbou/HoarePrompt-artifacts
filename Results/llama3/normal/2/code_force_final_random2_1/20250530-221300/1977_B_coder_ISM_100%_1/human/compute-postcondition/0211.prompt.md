Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t < 2^30), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing a single positive integer x (1 <= x < 2^30)
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, length is either 30 or 31, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is either 30 or 31, flag is either 0 or 1, and s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If flag is 1, then either the last element of s is '1' or length is 31, s[29] is '0' and s[30] is '1'. For all i in range(1, length), if s[i] was originally '-1' and s[i - 1] was '1', then s[i] is now '0' and s[i - 1] is now '-1'. Otherwise, the values of s[i] and s[i - 1] remain unchanged., and the list s of either 30 or 31 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 1, x is an integer, length is either 30 or 31, stdin contains t-2 inputs, s is a list containing either 30 or 31 strings, i is either 30 or 31, flag is either 0 or 1. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then s[i] is set to '0' and s[i - 1] is set to '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made., the length of the list s which is either 30 or 31 is being printed, and the list s containing either 30 or 31 strings is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nalla is 2, x is an integer equal to the input value, length is either 30 or 31, stdin contains t-3 inputs, s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 0. If the element at index i of s is '-1' and the element at index i-1 of s is '1', then the element at index i of s is '0' and the element at index i-1 of s is '-1'. Otherwise, the state of s remains unchanged. i is equal to length-1, and the list s which is either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 1 or '0' if the bit at the corresponding position of x is 0. If the element at index i of s is '-1' and the element at index i-1 of s is '1', then the element at index i of s is '0' and the element at index i-1 of s is '-1'. Otherwise, the state of s remains unchanged is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
