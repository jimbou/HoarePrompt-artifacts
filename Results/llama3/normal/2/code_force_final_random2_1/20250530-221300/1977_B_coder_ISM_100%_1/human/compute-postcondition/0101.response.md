Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 1, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 inputs, s is a list containing 30 strings, and i is between 0 and 28 (inclusive). If flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', then s[i] is updated to '-1' and the rest of the elements in s remain unchanged. Otherwise, if flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is updated to '1' and the rest of the elements in s remain unchanged. In all other cases, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
