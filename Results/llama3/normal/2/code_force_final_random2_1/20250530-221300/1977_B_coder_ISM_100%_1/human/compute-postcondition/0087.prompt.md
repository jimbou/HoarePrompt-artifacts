Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 1, x is an integer, length is 30, stdin contains t-2 inputs, i is either 30 or 31, flag is either 0 or 1, and s is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs, `i` is less than 30, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `s` is a list containing one string. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, `s` contains '1', otherwise `s` contains '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs, `i` is less than 31, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `s` is a list containing two strings. The first string in `s` is '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, otherwise it is '0'. The second string in `s` is '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, otherwise it is '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 1, `x` is an integer, `length` is 30, `stdin` contains `t-2` inputs, `i` is less than 30 and greater than its current value, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `s` is a list containing three strings. The first string in `s` is '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, otherwise it is '0'. The second string in `s` is '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, otherwise it is '0'. The third string in `s` is '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, otherwise it is '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
