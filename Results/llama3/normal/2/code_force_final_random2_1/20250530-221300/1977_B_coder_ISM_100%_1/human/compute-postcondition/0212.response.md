Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case is a single positive integer x. It then converts each integer into a binary string, applies a series of bit manipulation rules to the string, and prints the resulting string along with its length. The rules involve flipping bits, inserting new bits, and swapping bits based on certain conditions. The function processes all test cases and prints the modified binary strings and their lengths.**
