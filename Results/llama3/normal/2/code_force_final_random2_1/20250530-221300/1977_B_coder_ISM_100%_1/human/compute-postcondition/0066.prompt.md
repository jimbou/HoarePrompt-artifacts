Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, length is either 30 or 31, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is 29, flag is either 0 or 1, and s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If flag is 1, then either the last element of s is '1' or length is 31, s[29] is '0' and s[30] is '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, length is either 30 or 31 and must be at least 2, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is 1, flag is either 0 or 1, and s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If flag is 1, then either the last element of s is '1' or length is 31, s[29] is '0' and s[30] is '1'. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, the values of s[i] and s[i - 1] remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, nalla is 0, x is an integer, length is either 30 or 31 and must be greater than 2, stdin contains t-1 inputs, i is 2, flag is either 0 or 1, and s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If flag is 1, then either the last element of s is '1' or length is 31, s[29] is '0' and s[30] is '1'. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, the values of s[i] and s[i - 1] remain unchanged. If s[2] is '-1' and s[1] is '1', then s[2] is '0' and s[1] is '-1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an integer, `length` is either 30 or 31 and must be greater than 3, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs, `i` is 3, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements, where if `s[3]` was originally '-1' and `s[2]` was '1', then `s[3]` is now '0' and `s[2]` is now '-1'. Otherwise, the values of `s[3]` and `s[2]` remain unchanged. The remaining elements of `s` are either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1, then either the last element of `s` is '1' or `length` is 31, `s[29]` is '0' and `s[30]` is '1'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
