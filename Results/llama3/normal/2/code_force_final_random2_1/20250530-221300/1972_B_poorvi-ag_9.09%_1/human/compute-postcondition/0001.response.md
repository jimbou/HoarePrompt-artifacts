The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer equal to the number of test cases, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. So for the loop to be executed `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
