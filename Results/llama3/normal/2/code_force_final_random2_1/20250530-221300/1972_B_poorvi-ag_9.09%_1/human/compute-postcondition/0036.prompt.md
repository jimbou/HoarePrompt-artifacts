Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, i is t, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin is empty. If all n values are even, results is a list containing t strings 'no'. If any n value is odd, results is a list containing 'yes' for each n value that has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D' and 'no' for each n value that has less or equal occurrences of 'U' than 'D'.
Code of the loop:
for i in results:
    print(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `i` is the first element of `results`, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `results` is a list containing at least one element, which is either 'yes' or 'no', and the first element of the list `results` which is either 'yes' or 'no' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `i` is the second element of `results`, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements, which are either 'yes' or 'no', and the second element of the list `results` which is either 'yes' or 'no' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `i` is the third element of `results`, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `results` is a list containing at least 3 elements, which are either 'yes' or 'no', and the third element of the list `results` which is either 'yes' or 'no' is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
