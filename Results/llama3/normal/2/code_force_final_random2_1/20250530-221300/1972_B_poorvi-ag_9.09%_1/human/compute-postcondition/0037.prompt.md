You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and then a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D".
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: t is 0, i is t, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin is empty. If all n values are even, results is a list containing t strings 'no'. If any n value is odd, results is a list containing 'yes' for each n value that has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D' and 'no' for each n value that has less or equal occurrences of 'U' than 'D'.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: t is 0, i is the last element of results, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin is empty, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' for each n value, and the last element of the list results which is either 'yes' or 'no' has been printed.

```

Return Postconditions: t is 0, i is the last element of results, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin is empty, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' for each n value, and the last element of the list results which is either 'yes' or 'no' has been printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
