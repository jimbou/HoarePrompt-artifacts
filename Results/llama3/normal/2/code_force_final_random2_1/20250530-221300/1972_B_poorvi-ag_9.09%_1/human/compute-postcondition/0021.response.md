Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is a list containing one string 'no' if `n` is even, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and 'no' if `n` is odd and `arr` has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', `results` is a list containing 'yes', 'no' and 'no' if `n` is odd and `arr` has less or equal occurrences of 'U' than 'D', and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The `results` list, however, has been updated to include an additional 'no' at the end, regardless of the previous conditions. This means that if `n` is even, the list now contains two 'no's. If `n` is odd and `arr` has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', the list now contains 'yes' and 'no'. If `n` is odd and `arr` has less or equal occurrences of 'U' than 'D', the list now contains 'yes', 'no', and 'no'. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three.
