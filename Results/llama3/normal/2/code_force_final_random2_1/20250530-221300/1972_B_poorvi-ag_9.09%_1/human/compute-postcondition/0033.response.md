The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results`. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `results`, which is either 'yes' or 'no'. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `i` is the third element of the list.
State: **`t` is 0, `i` is the third element of `results`, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `results` is a list containing at least 3 elements, which are either 'yes' or 'no'**
