The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `results`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element of the list.
State: **`t` is 0, `i` is the second element of `results`, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements, which are either 'yes' or 'no'**
