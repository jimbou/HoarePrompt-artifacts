This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D". It then determines for each test case whether the number of "U"s is greater than the number of "D"s when n is odd, and prints "yes" if true, otherwise "no". If all n values are even, it prints "no" for each test case. The function processes all test cases and prints the results in the order they were received.
