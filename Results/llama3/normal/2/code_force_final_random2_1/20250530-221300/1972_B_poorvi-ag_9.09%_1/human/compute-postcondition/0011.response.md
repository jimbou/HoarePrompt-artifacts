Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If n is even, results is a list containing one string 'no'. If n is odd, results is a list containing 'yes' if arr has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', otherwise results is a list containing 'no'.***
