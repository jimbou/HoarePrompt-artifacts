Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, results is an empty list, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains greater than 0, and the value of `i` remains 0, as neither of these variables is modified by the code. The `results` list remains empty, as no elements are added to it. The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, and then reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `arr`. After these two lines of code, stdin contains two fewer test cases.
