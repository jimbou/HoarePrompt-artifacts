Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `results` is a list containing one string 'no' if `n` is even, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and 'no' if `n` is odd and `arr` has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', `results` is a list containing 'yes', 'no', and 'no' if `n` is odd and `arr` has less or equal occurrences of 'U' than 'D', and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 1, `i` is still 2, `n` is still an integer, and `arr` is still a string. The `results` list has been updated by appending 'no' to it. If `n` is even, the `results` list now contains two 'no's. If `n` is odd and `arr` has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', the `results` list now contains 'yes' and 'no'. If `n` is odd and `arr` has less or equal occurrences of 'U' than 'D', the `results` list now contains 'yes', 'no', and 'no'. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three.
