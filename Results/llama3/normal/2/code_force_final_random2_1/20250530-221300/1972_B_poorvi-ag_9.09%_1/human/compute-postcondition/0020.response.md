Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 2, n is an integer, arr is a string, results is a list containing one string 'no' if n is even, results is a list containing 'yes' if n is odd and arr has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', results is a list containing 'yes' and 'no' if n is odd and arr has less or equal occurrences of 'U' than 'D', and 'no' is appended to the results list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, making `n` an integer. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `arr`, making `arr` a string. The value of `t` remains greater than 1, and the value of `i` remains 2. The value of `results` depends on the values of `n` and `arr`. If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing one string 'no'. If `n` is odd and `arr` has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', `results` is a list containing 'yes'. If `n` is odd and `arr` has less or equal occurrences of 'U' than 'D', `results` is a list containing 'yes' and 'no', and 'no' is appended to the `results` list. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three.
