Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is a list containing one string 'no', `n` is an even integer, `arr` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

The code appends the string 'no' to the `results` list. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
