Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, results is a list containing one string 'no' if n is even, results is a list containing 'yes' if n is odd and arr has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', otherwise results is a list containing 'no', and 'no' is appended to the results list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 1, `n` is still an integer, and `arr` is still a string. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by two. The results list initially contained 'no' if `n` was even, 'yes' if `n` was odd and 'arr' had more 'U's than 'D's, and 'no' otherwise. Now, another 'no' is added to the results list.
