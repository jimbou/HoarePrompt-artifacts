The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing one string 'no'. If `n` is odd and `arr` has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', `results` is a list containing 'yes'. If `n` is odd and `arr` has less or equal occurrences of 'U' than 'D', `results` is a list containing 'yes' and 'no', and 'no' is appended to the `results` list.**
