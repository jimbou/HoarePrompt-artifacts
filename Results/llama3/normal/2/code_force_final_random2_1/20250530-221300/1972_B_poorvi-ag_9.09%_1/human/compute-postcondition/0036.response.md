Output State: **t is 0, i is the last element of results, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin is empty, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' for each n value, and the last element of the list results which is either 'yes' or 'no' has been printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the `results` list, printing each element. The loop variable `i` is now pointing to the last element of the `results` list, and the last element has been printed. The other variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
