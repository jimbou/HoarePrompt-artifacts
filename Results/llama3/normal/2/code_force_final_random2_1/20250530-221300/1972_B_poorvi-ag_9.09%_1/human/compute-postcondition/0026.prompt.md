Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and then a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D".
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        results.append('no')
    elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
        results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If n is even, results is a list containing one string 'no'. If n is odd, results is a list containing 'yes' if arr has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', otherwise results is a list containing 'no'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If n is even, results is a list containing one string 'no'. If n is odd and arr has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', results is a list containing 'yes'. If n is odd and arr has less or equal occurrences of 'U' than 'D', results is a list containing 'yes' and 'no', and 'no' is appended to the results list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 1, i is 2, n is an integer, arr is a string, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If n is even, results is a list containing one string 'no'. If n is odd, results is a list containing 'yes' and 'yes' if arr has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', otherwise results is a list containing 'yes' and 'no'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
