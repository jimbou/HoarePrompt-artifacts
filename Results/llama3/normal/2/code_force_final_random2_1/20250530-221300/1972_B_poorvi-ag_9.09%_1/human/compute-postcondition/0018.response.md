Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If n is even, results is a list containing one string 'no'. If n is odd and arr has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', results is a list containing 'yes'. If n is odd and arr has less or equal occurrences of 'U' than 'D', results is a list containing 'yes' and 'no', and 'no' is appended to the results list.***
