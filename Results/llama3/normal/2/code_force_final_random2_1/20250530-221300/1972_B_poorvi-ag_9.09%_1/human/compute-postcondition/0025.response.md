Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, i is 2, n is an integer, arr is a string, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If n is even, results is a list containing one string 'no'. If n is odd, results is a list containing 'yes' and 'yes' if arr has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', otherwise results is a list containing 'yes' and 'no'.***
