Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `results` is a list containing one string 'no' if `n` is even, `results` is a list containing 'yes' if `n` is odd and `arr` has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D', otherwise `results` is a list containing 'no' and 'yes'**

The code appends 'yes' to the `results` list. The other variables are not affected by this operation. The `results` list now contains an additional 'yes' element, while the other variables retain their original values.
