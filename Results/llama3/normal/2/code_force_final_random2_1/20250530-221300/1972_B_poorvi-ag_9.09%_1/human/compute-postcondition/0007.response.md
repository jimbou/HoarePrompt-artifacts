Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes', `n` is an odd integer, `arr` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The current value of `arr` has more occurrences of 'U' than 'D'.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include the string 'yes'. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still greater than 0, `i` still 0, `n` still an odd integer, and `arr` still a string with more occurrences of 'U' than 'D'. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
