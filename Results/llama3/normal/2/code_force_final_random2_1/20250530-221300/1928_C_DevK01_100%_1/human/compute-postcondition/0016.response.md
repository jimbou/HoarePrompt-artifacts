Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is greater than or equal to `x`, if the integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then the current value of `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `i`, `q // i`, and `i`. Otherwise, the current value of `M` is a list containing `i`, `q // i`, and `i`. Additionally, `q` is divisible by `i`, and `w` must be greater than `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `q` remains an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the value of `x` remains an integer between 1 and `q`. The value of `i` remains greater than or equal to `x`. The list `M` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `i`. If the integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` contains the square root of `q`, `i`, `q // i`, and `i`. Otherwise, `M` contains `i`, `q // i`, and `i`. The divisibility of `q` by `i` and the relationship between `w` and `i` remain unchanged.
