This function takes two integers, q and x, as input, where 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, and returns a list of all divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1. The function first checks if the square root of q is an integer greater than or equal to x - 1, and if so, adds it to the list. Then, it iterates from 1 to the square root of q, adding any divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1 to the list. The function returns this list of divisors.
