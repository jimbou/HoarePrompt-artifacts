Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is greater than or equal to `x`, if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then the current value of `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `i`, `q // i`, and `i` if the integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, otherwise `M` is a list containing `i`, `q // i`, and `i`. Additionally, `q` is divisible by `i`, and `w` must be greater than `i`.***
