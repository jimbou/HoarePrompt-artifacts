Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 1, if the square root of `q` is an integer greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then the current value of `M` is a list containing the square root of `q` and `i`. Otherwise, the current value of `M` is a list containing `i`, and `w` must be greater than 1. Additionally, `q` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1.***
