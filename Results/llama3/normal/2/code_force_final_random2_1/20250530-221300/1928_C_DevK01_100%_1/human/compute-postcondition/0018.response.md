Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is greater than or equal to `x`, `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `i`, `q // i`, and `i` if the integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, otherwise `M` is a list containing `i`, `q // i`, `i`, and `q // i`, `q` is divisible by `i`, and `w` must be greater than `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `q` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `i` remains the same, but the list `M` has been updated to include an additional element, which is the integer division of `q` by `i`. The other conditions, such as `q` being divisible by `i` and `w` being greater than `i`, still hold true.
