Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 1, if the square root of `q` is an integer greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then the current value of `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `i`, and `q // i`. Otherwise, the current value of `M` is a list containing `i` and `q // i`. Additionally, `q` is divisible by `i`, and `w` must be greater than 1. The current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1. The integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been updated to include the result of the integer division of `q` by `i`, which is `q // i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the code was executed are still true.
