Output State: **q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than q, i is equal to w, M is a list containing all the divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` will be equal to `w`, and the list `M` will contain all the divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. The values of `q` and `x` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
