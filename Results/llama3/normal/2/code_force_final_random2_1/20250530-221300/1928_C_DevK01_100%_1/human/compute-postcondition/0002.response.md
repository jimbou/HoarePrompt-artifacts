Output State: **q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than q, M is a list containing the square root of q, w is the square root of q, and the current value of w is an integer greater than or equal to x - 1.**

In this output state, the list M now contains the square root of q, which is the current value of w. The other variables remain unchanged.
