Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 1, if the square root of `q` is an integer greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been updated to 1, while the values of `q`, `x`, and `M` remain the same as in the initial state. The condition for `M` to contain the square root of `q` still depends on whether the square root of `q` is an integer greater than or equal to `x` - 1.
