The variables in the loop head are `i` and `w`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `w`. If `i` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, and `w` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `w` must be greater than the current value of `i`. Since `i` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, we can conclude that `w` must be greater than `x + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `i`, `q // i`, and `i` if the integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, otherwise `M` is a list containing `i`, `q // i`, `i`, and `q // i`, and `w` must be greater than `x + 1`.**
