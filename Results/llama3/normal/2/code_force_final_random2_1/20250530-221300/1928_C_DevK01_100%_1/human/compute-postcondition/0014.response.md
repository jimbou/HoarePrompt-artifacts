Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is greater than or equal to `x`, if the integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then the current value of `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `i`, and `q // i`. Otherwise, the current value of `M` is a list containing `i` and `q // i`. Additionally, `q` is divisible by `i`, and `w` must be greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now greater than or equal to `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `M` still depends on the condition that if the integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then it contains the square root of `q`, `i`, and `q // i`, otherwise it contains `i` and `q // i`. Also, `q` is still divisible by `i`, and `w` is still greater than 1.
