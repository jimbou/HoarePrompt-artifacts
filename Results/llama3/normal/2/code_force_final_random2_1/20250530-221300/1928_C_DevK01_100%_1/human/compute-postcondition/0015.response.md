According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `w`. If `i` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `w` must be greater than 1. Since `i` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than or equal to 1. However, `w` being greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `w` must be greater than `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is greater than or equal to `x`, if the integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then the current value of `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `i`, and `q // i`. Otherwise, the current value of `M` is a list containing `i` and `q // i`. Additionally, `q` is divisible by `i`, and `w` must be greater than `i`.**
