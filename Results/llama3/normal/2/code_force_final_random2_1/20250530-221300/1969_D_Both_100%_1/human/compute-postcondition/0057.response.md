State: **`combined` is an empty list, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 1, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` that is either equal to `item` or the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, `current_profit` is either equal to its previous value if `removed_item` does not exist, otherwise it is decreased by the first element of `removed_item` and then increased by the first element of `item`, and `max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged, and max_profit is printed, and test_cases must be greater than 1**
