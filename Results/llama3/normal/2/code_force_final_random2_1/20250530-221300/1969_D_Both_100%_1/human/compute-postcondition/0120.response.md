Output State: **`combined` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, and has one less item than before, `heap` contains the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `_` is 1**

In this output state, the `combined` list has been modified by removing its last item, which is now stored in the `heap` and `item` variables. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and properties.
