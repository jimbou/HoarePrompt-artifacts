To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`combined` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `heap` is an empty list, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `k` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `_` is 0**
