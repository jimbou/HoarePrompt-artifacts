Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: combined is a list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, heap is an empty list, k is the second value returned by func_2(), n is the first value returned by func_2(), prices is a list of values returned by func_2(), neg_prices is a list of negative prices, bonuses is a list of values returned by func_2(), max_profit is 0, current_profit is 0, remaining_items is an empty list, and test_cases must be greater than 1
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`combined` is a list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the smallest bonus from `combined` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `heap` is an empty list, `k` is at least 1, `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`combined` is a list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the smallest bonus from `combined` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `heap` is an empty list, `k` is at least 2, `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is greater than 1. If `combined` is not empty, `combined` has one less tuple than before and `heap` has one more tuple than before. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `combined` is a list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the smallest bonus from `combined` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `heap` is an empty list, `k` is at least 1, `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is greater than 1. If `combined` is not empty, `combined` has one less tuple than before and `heap` has one more tuple than before. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
