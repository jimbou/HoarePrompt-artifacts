Output State: **`combined` is a list with one less item than before, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `removed_item` is the smallest item in `heap` before the push and pop operation and it exists, `max_profit` is equal to the maximum of its initial value and the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` minus `removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` minus `removed_item[0]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from its previous value. The value of `current_profit` now depends on whether the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, and it is calculated based on the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, `item[1]`, `item[0]`, and `removed_item[0]`.
