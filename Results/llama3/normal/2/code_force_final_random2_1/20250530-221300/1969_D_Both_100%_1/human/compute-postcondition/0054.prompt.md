Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`combined` is a list, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, and `k` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`combined` is a non-empty list with one less item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`. `max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged. `current_profit` is either decreased by the second element of `item` and the first element of `removed_item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, or increased by the first element of `item` and decreased by the first element of `removed_item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0, or decreased by the second element of `item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, or increased by the first element of `item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`combined` is a non-empty list with at least one item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` that is either equal to `item` or the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. In any case, `current_profit` is either equal to its previous value if `removed_item` does not exist, otherwise it is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`combined` is a list with at least one item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` that is either equal to `item` or the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`. `current_profit` is either equal to its previous value if `removed_item` does not exist, otherwise it is decreased by the first element of `removed_item` and then increased by the first element of `item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
