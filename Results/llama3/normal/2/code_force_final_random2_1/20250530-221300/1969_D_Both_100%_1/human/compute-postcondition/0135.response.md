Output State: **`combined` is a list with one less item than before, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `max_profit` is equal to the maximum of its initial value and the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]`. The sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `current_profit` has been updated to be the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]`, which is the second element of the last item that was in `combined` before the removal.
