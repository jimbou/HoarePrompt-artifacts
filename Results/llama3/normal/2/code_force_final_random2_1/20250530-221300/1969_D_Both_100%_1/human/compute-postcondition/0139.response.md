Output State: **`combined` is a list with one less item than before, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `removed_item` is the smallest item in `heap` before the push and pop operation, `max_profit` is equal to the maximum of its initial value and the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]`.**

The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` pushes the `item` onto the `heap` and then pops the smallest item from the `heap`, which is assigned to `removed_item`. The `heap` still contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, and `item` is still the last item that was in `combined` before the removal. The values of the other variables are not affected.
