Postcondition: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by the bonus in ascending order. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the smallest bonus from `combined`. Otherwise, `heap` remains an empty list. `k` is greater than 0, `test_cases` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `prices` is a list of integers, `neg_prices` is a list of negative integers, `bonuses` is a list of integers, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list.**
