Output State: **`combined` is an empty list, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `max_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained from the items in `combined`, and `current_profit` is the profit obtained from the items in `combined` after the last iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `combined` is empty, `item` is the last item that was removed from `combined`, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, and the other variables remain unchanged. The `max_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained from the items in `combined`, and `current_profit` is the profit obtained from the items in `combined` after the last iteration of the loop.
