Postcondition: ***`combined` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by bonuses in ascending order. If `combined` is not empty, it has one less item than before, and `heap` contains the last item that was in `combined` before the removal. Otherwise, `combined` and `heap` remain unchanged. `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal if `combined` is not empty, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `_` is 0.***
