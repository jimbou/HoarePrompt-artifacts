Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the maximum possible profit that can be achieved by selecting a subset of items with negative prices and bonuses, given a certain number of items to choose (k). It takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the maximum profit. The function iterates over a list of test cases, and for each test case, it initializes variables, generates a list of items with negative prices and bonuses, and then simulates a process of selecting items to maximize profit. The function maintains a heap of items sorted by their bonuses and updates the current profit and maximum profit as it iterates over the items. Finally, it prints the maximum profit achieved.**
