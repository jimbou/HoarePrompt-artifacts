Output State: **`combined` is an empty list, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the `combined` list becomes empty, and the `heap` list contains all the tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
