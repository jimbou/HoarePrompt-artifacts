Output State: **`combined` is a non-empty list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the smallest bonus from `combined`, `k` is at least 1, `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is greater than 1.**

The code pushes the tuple with the smallest bonus from the `combined` list into the `heap` list, effectively removing it from `combined`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
