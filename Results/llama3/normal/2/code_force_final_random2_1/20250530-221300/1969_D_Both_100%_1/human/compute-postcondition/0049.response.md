Output State: **`combined` is a list with at least one item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` that is either equal to `item` or the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, then `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is either equal to its previous value if `removed_item` does not exist, otherwise it is decreased by the first element of `removed_item` and then increased by the first element of `item`.**

The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` removes the smallest bonus tuple from `heap` and replaces it with `item`, then assigns the removed tuple to `removed_item`. This operation does not change the values of `combined`, `k`, or `current_profit` directly. However, the value of `removed_item` is updated to be the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` that is either equal to `item` or the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`. The value of `heap` is also updated to include `item` and exclude the removed tuple.
