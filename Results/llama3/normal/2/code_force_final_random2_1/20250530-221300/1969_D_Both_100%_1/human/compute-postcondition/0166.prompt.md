Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `combined` is either an empty list or a non-empty list. If `combined` is a non-empty list, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `max_profit` is equal to the maximum of its initial value and the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `combined` is an empty list, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `combined` is a list with one less item than before, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. The state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition, with `current_profit` being equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, or plus `item[0]` otherwise. If `removed_item` exists, then `removed_item` is the smallest item in `heap` before the push and pop operation.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `combined` has one less item than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined` except the last one and the smallest item in `heap` before the push and pop operation, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`combined` has at least one item, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined` except the last item, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `removed_item` exists, `removed_item` is the smallest item in `heap` that is larger than `item`, and `current_profit` is updated to be `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
