Output State: **`combined` is a non-empty list, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, and `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`.**

In this output state, the values of `combined`, `heap`, and `k` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The only change is the assignment of the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` to the variable `current_profit`. The specific value of `current_profit` depends on the implementation of the `func_3` function, which is not provided.
