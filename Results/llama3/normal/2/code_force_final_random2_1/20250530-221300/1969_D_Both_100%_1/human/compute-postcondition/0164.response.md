Output State: **`combined` has at least one item, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined` except the last item, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `removed_item` exists, `removed_item` is the smallest item in `heap` that is larger than `item`, `current_profit` is updated to be `current_profit - removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `max_profit`, which is now equal to `current_profit`. The value of `max_profit` has been updated to be the same as `current_profit`, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
