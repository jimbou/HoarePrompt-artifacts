Postcondition: ***`combined` is a non-empty list with one less item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` before pushing `item` into `heap`, `current_profit` is either decreased by the second element of `item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, or increased by the first element of `item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0. The current value of `removed_item` is not empty.***
