Output State: **`combined` is a non-empty list with at least one item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`, `max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged. `current_profit` is either increased by the first element of `item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0, or increased by the first element of `item` and the first element of `removed_item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code increases the `current_profit` by the first element of `item`. The `combined` list remains the same, the `heap` list remains the same, `k` remains 0, and `item` remains the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`. The `max_profit` remains either equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise it remains unchanged. The `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0, or increased by the first element of `item` and the first element of `removed_item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0.
