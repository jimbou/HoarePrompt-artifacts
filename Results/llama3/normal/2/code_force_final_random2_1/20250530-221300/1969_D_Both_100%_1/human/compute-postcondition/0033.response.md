Postcondition: ***`combined` is a non-empty list with one less item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`. `max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged. `current_profit` is either decreased by the second element of `item` and the first element of `removed_item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, or increased by the first element of `item` and decreased by the first element of `removed_item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0, or decreased by the second element of `item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, or increased by the first element of `item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0.***
