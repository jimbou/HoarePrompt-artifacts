The `print(max_profit)` statement will print the maximum profit that can be achieved by removing and adding items to the `combined` list while maintaining a sorted order of bonuses in the `heap` list.

Since `combined` is initially an empty list, `heap` is also empty, and `k` is 0, there are no items to remove or add, and `current_profit` remains unchanged. As a result, `max_profit` will be equal to its initial value, which is not explicitly stated in the precondition.

However, based on the description of how `current_profit` and `max_profit` are updated, it can be inferred that `max_profit` is initialized to a value that is less than or equal to `current_profit`. Therefore, `max_profit` will be printed as its initial value, which is not explicitly stated in the precondition.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the initial value of max_profit)**
