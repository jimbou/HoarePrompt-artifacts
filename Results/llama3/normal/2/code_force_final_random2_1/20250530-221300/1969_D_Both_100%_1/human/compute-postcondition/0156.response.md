The only variable in the loop head is variable combined, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable combined.  If combined is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, combined has one less item than before, So for the loop to be executed one more time combined must have had more than one item before the last iteration.
State: **`combined` has more than one item, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined` except the last one and the smallest item in `heap` before the push and pop operation, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
