Postcondition: ***`combined` is a list, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, and `k` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`.***
