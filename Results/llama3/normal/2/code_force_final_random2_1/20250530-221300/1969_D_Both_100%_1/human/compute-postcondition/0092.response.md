Output State: **`combined` is not empty but its last item has been removed, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1. If `removed_item` is not empty, `current_profit` was decreased by `removed_item[0]` and then decreased by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` was decreased by `item[1]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code decreases the `current_profit` by the second value of the `item` tuple. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The `combined` list still has its last item removed, and the `heap` still contains all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order. The values returned by `func_2()` are still stored in `k`, `n`, `prices`, and `bonuses`. The `neg_prices` list still contains negative prices, and `test_cases` is still greater than 1. The `removed_item` variable is still either empty or contains the item with the smallest bonus in the heap. The `max_profit` is updated if the new `current_profit` is greater than it.
