Output State: **`combined` is a list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, but with one less tuple than before, `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the smallest bonus from `combined` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `heap` is an empty list, but now it contains one more tuple than before, `k` is at least 2, `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is greater than 1**

In this output state, the `combined` list has been reduced by one tuple, which has been added to the `heap` list. The `heap` list now contains one more tuple than before, which is the tuple with the smallest bonus from the `combined` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
