Output State: **`combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the smallest bonus from `combined`, `k` is greater than 0, `test_cases` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `prices` is a list of integers, `neg_prices` is a list of negative integers, `bonuses` is a list of integers, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the `heap` list now contains the tuple with the smallest bonus from the `combined` list, which has been removed from `combined`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
