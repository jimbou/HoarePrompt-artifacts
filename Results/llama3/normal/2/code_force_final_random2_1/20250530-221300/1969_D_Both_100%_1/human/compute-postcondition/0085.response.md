Output State: **`combined` is a list with one less item than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1. `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`, `removed_item` is the item with the smallest bonus in the heap, which is either the item that was just pushed or the smallest item that was already in the heap. Additionally, `removed_item` is not empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `combined` has one less item than before, and the last item that was in `combined` is stored in the variable `item`. The list `heap` contains all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order. The values of `k`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged. The variable `current_profit` has been decreased by the value of `removed_item[0]`, which is the item with the smallest bonus in the heap. The variable `removed_item` is not empty and is either the item that was just pushed or the smallest item that was already in the heap.
