The only variable in the loop head is variable  k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 2. Since the loop iterates over the range of `k`, we need to decrease `k` by 1 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`combined` is a list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the smallest bonus from `combined` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `heap` is an empty list, `k` is at least 1, `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is greater than 1. If `combined` is not empty, `combined` has one less tuple than before and `heap` has one more tuple than before. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
