Postcondition: ***`combined` is either an empty list or a non-empty list. If `combined` is a non-empty list, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, and `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `combined` is an empty list, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
