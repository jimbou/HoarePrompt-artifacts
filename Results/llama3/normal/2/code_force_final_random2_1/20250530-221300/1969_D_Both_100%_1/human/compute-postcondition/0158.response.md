Output State: **`combined` has at least one item, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined` except the last two items, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list. `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item`, and if the updated `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the new value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `current_profit`, which is decreased by the second element of `item`. The value of `max_profit` is updated if the new value of `current_profit` is greater than it, otherwise it remains the same.
