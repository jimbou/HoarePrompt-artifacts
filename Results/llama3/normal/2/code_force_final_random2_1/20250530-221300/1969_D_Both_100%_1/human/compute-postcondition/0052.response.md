Output State: **`combined` is a list with at least one item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` that is either equal to `item` or the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`, `current_profit` is either equal to its previous value if `removed_item` does not exist, otherwise it is decreased by the first element of `removed_item` and then increased by the first element of `item`, and `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `combined` still has at least one item, the list `heap` remains sorted by bonus in ascending order, the value of `k` is still 0, the `removed_item` is still the tuple with the smallest bonus that was either equal to `item` or removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, and `item` is still the last item removed from `combined`. The `current_profit` is either unchanged if `removed_item` doesn't exist, or it's updated by subtracting the first element of `removed_item` and then adding the first element of `item`. Additionally, a new variable `max_profit` is introduced, which is equal to the current value of `current_profit`.
