Postcondition: **`combined` is a non-empty list with one less item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`. If the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`, which is negative since the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0.**
