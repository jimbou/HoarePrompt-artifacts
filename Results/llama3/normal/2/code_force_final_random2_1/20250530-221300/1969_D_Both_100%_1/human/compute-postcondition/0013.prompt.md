Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: combined is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, heap is an empty list, k is a non-negative integer, test_cases is at least 1, n is a non-negative integer, prices is a list of integers, neg_prices is a list of negative integers, bonuses is a list of integers, max_profit is 0, current_profit is 0, remaining_items is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `combined` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by the bonus in ascending order. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the smallest bonus from `combined`. Otherwise, `heap` remains an empty list. `k` is greater than 0, `test_cases` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `prices` is a list of integers, `neg_prices` is a list of negative integers, `bonuses` is a list of integers, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`combined` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by the bonus in ascending order. If `combined` is not empty, it has one less element than before, and `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the smallest bonus from the original `combined`. Otherwise, `combined` remains unchanged. Additionally, `k` is greater than 1, `test_cases` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `prices` is a list of integers, `neg_prices` is a list of negative integers, `bonuses` is a list of integers, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`combined` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by the bonus in ascending order. If `combined` is not empty, it has one less element than before, and `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the smallest bonus from the original `combined`. Otherwise, `combined` remains unchanged. Additionally, `k` is greater than 0, `test_cases` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `prices` is a list of integers, `neg_prices` is a list of negative integers, `bonuses` is a list of integers, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
