To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is `while combined:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `combined` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop, we can see that `combined` is a list, but its contents are not specified. For the loop to execute at least once, `combined` must not be empty.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `combined`, which must be a non-empty list.

State: **`combined` is a non-empty list, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit` which is greater than 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
