Output State: **`combined` is a list with one less item than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1. `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`, which is negative because the sum of `item[0]` and `item[1]` is less than 0. If the new value of `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit` which is greater than 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `combined` has one less item, and the last item is stored in `item`. The heap is still sorted by bonuses in ascending order. The values of `k`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain the same. The `test_cases` is still greater than 1. The `current_profit` is increased by the negative value of `item[0]`. If this new value is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to this new value, and `remaining_items` becomes an empty list. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same.
