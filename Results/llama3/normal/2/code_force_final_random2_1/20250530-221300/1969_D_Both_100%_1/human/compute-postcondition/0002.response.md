Output State: **combined is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, heap is an empty list, k is a non-negative integer, test_cases is at least 1, n is a non-negative integer, prices is a list of integers, neg_prices is a list of negative integers, bonuses is a list of integers, max_profit is 0, current_profit is 0, remaining_items is an empty list.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the `combined` list is sorted in ascending order based on the bonuses. The `heap` list is empty. The value of `k` remains unchanged as a non-negative integer. The `test_cases` variable is still at least 1. The `n` variable is assigned a non-negative integer value. The `prices` list contains a list of integers. The `neg_prices` list contains a list of negative integers, which are the negations of the prices. The `bonuses` list contains a list of integers. The `max_profit` and `current_profit` variables are both initialized to 0. The `remaining_items` list is empty.
