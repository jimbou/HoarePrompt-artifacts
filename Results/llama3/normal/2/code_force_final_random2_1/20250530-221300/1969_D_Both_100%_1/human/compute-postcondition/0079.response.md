Output State: **`combined` is a list with one less item than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1. If `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than 0, then `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`, otherwise `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]` but it is not greater than 0. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit` and `remaining_items` is an empty list. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the value of `item[1]`. If the initial value of `item[0] + item[1]` was greater than 0, then the updated value of `current_profit` is still greater than 0. However, if the initial value of `item[0] + item[1]` was not greater than 0, then the updated value of `current_profit` is not greater than 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
