Output State: **`combined` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, but with one less item, `heap` is a list containing one tuple, which is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `_` is 0.**

In this output state, the `combined` list has been reduced by one item, which has been pushed onto the `heap` list. The `item` variable still holds the last item that was in `combined` before the removal. All other variables remain unchanged.
