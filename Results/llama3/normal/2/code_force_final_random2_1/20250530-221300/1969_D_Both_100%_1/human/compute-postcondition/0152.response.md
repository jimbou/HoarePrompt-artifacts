Output State: **`combined` has one less item than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined` except the last one and the smallest item in `heap` before the push and pop operation, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. If the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` minus `removed_item[0]`. If the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0, then `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` minus `removed_item[0]`. `removed_item` is the smallest item in `heap` before the push and pop operation.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting `removed_item[0]`. The value of `current_profit` depends on the sum of the first two elements of `item`. If the sum is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` minus `removed_item[0]`. If the sum is less than 0, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` minus `removed_item[0]`.
