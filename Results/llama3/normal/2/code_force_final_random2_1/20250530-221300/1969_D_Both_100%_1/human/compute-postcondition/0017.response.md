Postcondition: ***`combined` is a list, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, and `k` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, the current value of `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and it is greater than `max_profit`.***
