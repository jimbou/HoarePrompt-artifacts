Output State: **`combined` is a non-empty list with one less item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, and `item` is the last item that was in `combined`**

In this output state, the list `combined` has been modified by removing its last item, which is now stored in the variable `item`. The list `heap` remains unchanged, still containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order. The value of `k` remains 0. The variable `item` now holds the value of the last item that was in `combined` before it was removed.
