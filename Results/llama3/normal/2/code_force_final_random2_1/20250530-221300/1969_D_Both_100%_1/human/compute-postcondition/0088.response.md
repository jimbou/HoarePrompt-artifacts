Output State: **`combined` is a list with one less item than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1. If `removed_item` is not empty, `current_profit` was decreased by `removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, `removed_item` is the item with the smallest bonus in the heap, which is either the item that was just pushed or the smallest item that was already in the heap. `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` which is greater than the previous `max_profit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code assigns the current value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`, effectively updating `max_profit` to be equal to `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their previous values and relationships.
