Output State: **`combined` is a list with one less item than before, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, and `current_profit` is greater than its previous value. If `removed_item` exists, then `removed_item` is the smallest item in `heap` before the push and pop operation, and if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` minus `removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` minus `removed_item[0]`. If `removed_item` does not exist, then the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition, with `current_profit` being equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, or plus `item[0]` otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `max_profit`, which is now equal to `current_profit`. The value of `current_profit` is still greater than its previous value, and its calculation depends on the existence of `removed_item` and the sum of the first two elements of `item`.
