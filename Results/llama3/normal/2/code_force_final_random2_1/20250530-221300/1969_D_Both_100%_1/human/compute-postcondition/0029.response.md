Output State: **`combined` is a non-empty list with one less item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` before pushing `item` into `heap`, `current_profit` is either decreased by the second element of `item` and the first element of `removed_item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, or increased by the first element of `item` and decreased by the first element of `removed_item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `combined` has one less item, and the list `heap` remains sorted by bonus in ascending order. The value of `k` is still 0, and the value of `item` is the last item that was in `combined`. The value of `removed_item` is still the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` before pushing `item` into `heap`. The value of `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the first element of `removed_item` from its previous value, which was either decreased by the second element of `item` or increased by the first element of `item` depending on the sum of the first two elements of `item`.
