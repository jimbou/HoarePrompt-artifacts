Postcondition: ***`combined` has at least one item, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined` except the last item, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `removed_item` exists, `removed_item` is the smallest item in `heap` that is larger than `item`, and `current_profit` is updated to be `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.***
