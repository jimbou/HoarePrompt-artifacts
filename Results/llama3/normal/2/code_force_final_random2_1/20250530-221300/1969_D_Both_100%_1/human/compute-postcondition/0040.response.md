Output State: **`combined` is a non-empty list with at least one item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` that is either equal to `item` or the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`, `max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `combined` still has at least one item, the list `heap` still contains all tuples from the original `combined` sorted by bonus, the value of `k` remains 0, the value of `removed_item` is still the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` that is either equal to `item` or the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, the value of `item` is still the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`, the value of `max_profit` is still either equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged, and the value of `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`.
