Output State: **`combined` is a non-empty list with at least one item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` that is either equal to `item` or the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`, `max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged. If the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item`. If the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The `combined` list remains non-empty with at least one item. The `heap` list is updated by removing the tuple with the smallest bonus and adding the `item` tuple, maintaining the sorted order by bonus. The `k` value remains 0. A new variable `removed_item` is introduced, which is the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, or `item` itself if it was the one with the smallest bonus. The `item` variable still holds the last item removed from `combined`. The `max_profit` value is updated based on the comparison with `current_profit`, and `current_profit` is updated based on the sum of the first two elements of `item`.
