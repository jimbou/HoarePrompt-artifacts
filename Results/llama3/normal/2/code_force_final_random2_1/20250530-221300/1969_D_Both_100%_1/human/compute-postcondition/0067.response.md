Output State: **`combined` is a list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, with one less tuple than before, `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the smallest bonus from `combined` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `heap` is an empty list, with one more tuple than before, `k` is at least 1, `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `combined` has one less tuple than before, and the list `heap` has one more tuple than before. The tuple with the smallest bonus from `combined` has been moved to `heap`. All other variables remain unchanged.
