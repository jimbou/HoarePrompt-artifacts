Postcondition: **`combined` is a list with one less item than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1. If `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, then the current value of `current_profit` is `current_profit - item[1]`, otherwise the current value of `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`, which is negative because the sum of `item[0]` and `item[1]` is less than 0. If the new value of `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then the current value of `max_profit` is the value of `current_profit` which is greater than 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. `removed_item` is the item with the smallest bonus in the heap, which is either the item that was just pushed or the smallest item that was already in the heap. Additionally, `removed_item` is not empty.**
