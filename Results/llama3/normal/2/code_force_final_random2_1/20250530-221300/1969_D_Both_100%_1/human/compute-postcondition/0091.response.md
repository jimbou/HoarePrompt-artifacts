Output State: **`combined` is not empty but its last item has been removed, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1. If `removed_item` is not empty, `current_profit` was decreased by `removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, `removed_item` is the item with the smallest bonus in the heap, which is either the item that was just pushed or the smallest item that was already in the heap. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The last item has been removed from the `combined` list, and the `item` variable now holds this removed item. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, including the `heap`, `k`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `test_cases`. The `removed_item` and `current_profit` variables are updated based on the previous state, and `max_profit` is updated if `current_profit` is greater than it.
