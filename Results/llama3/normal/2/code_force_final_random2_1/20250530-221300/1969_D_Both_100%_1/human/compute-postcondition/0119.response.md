To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.


The loop head is `for _ in range(k):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `k`.


According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0.


For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `k` remains the same.


State: **`combined` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by bonuses in ascending order. If `combined` is not empty, it has one less item than before, and `heap` contains the last item that was in `combined` before the removal. Otherwise, `combined` and `heap` remain unchanged. `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal if `combined` is not empty, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `_` is 1**
