Output State: **`combined` is not empty but its size is reduced by 1, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple in `heap` that was replaced by `item`, If `removed_item` is not empty, `heap` contains `item` and does not contain `removed_item`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, then `current_profit` was decreased by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` was increased by `item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `current_profit` has been decreased by the value of `removed_item[0]`. This means that the value of `current_profit` has been updated to be lower than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
