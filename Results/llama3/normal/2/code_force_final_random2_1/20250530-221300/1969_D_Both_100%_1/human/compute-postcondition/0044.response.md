The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `combined` being non-empty. At the end of the last iteration, `combined` is a non-empty list with at least one item, but it has been reduced by one item (the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`). So for the loop to be executed one more time, `combined` must have had at least two items initially and currently must have at least one item.

State: **`combined` is a list with at least two items initially and currently must have at least one item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` that is either equal to `item` or the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. In any case, `current_profit` is either equal to its previous value if `removed_item` does not exist, otherwise it is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`.**
