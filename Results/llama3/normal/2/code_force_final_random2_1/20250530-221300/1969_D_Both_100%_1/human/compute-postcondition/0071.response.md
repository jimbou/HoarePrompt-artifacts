Output State: **`combined` is a non-empty list, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is the value returned by func_3(combined, heap), `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is greater than 1.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated to the value returned by the function `func_3(combined, heap)`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The function `func_3(combined, heap)` has been executed with the current values of `combined` and `heap` as arguments, and its return value has been assigned to `current_profit`.
