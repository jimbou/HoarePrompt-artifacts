Output State: **`combined` has at least one item, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined` except the last two items, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the code has removed the last item from the `combined` list and assigned it to the `item` variable. The `heap` still contains all the items that were initially in `combined` except the last two items. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
