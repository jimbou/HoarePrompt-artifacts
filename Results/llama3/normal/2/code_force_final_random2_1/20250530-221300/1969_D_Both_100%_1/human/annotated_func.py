#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0).
    return int(read_input())
    #The program returns an integer greater than 0 that was input from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads an integer greater than 0 from standard input and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string of space-separated integers.
    return map(int, read_input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, where each integer is a result of converting a space-separated string from the input into an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:Converts a string of space-separated integers into a sequence of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: primary_items is a list of pairs of integers, secondary_heap is a list of pairs of integers.
    total = sum(item[0] for item in secondary_heap)
    for item in primary_items:
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:

    #State: `primary_items` is an empty list, `secondary_heap` is a list of pairs of integers, `total` is the sum of the first elements of all pairs in `secondary_heap` plus the sum of the elements of all pairs in `primary_items` that have a sum greater than or equal to 0.
    return total
    #The program returns the sum of the first elements of all pairs in `secondary_heap`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the total sum of the first elements of all pairs in the secondary_heap list, plus the sum of the elements of all pairs in the primary_items list that have a sum greater than or equal to 0. The function empties the primary_items list in the process.

            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]

        print(max_profit)
        
    #State: `combined` is an empty list, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` that is either equal to `item` or the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, `current_profit` is either equal to its previous value if `removed_item` does not exist, otherwise it is decreased by the first element of `removed_item` and then increased by the first element of `item`, and `max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged, and max_profit is printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the maximum possible profit that can be achieved by selecting a subset of items with negative prices and bonuses, given a certain number of items to choose (k). It takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the maximum profit. The function iterates over a list of test cases, and for each test case, it initializes variables, generates a list of items with negative prices and bonuses, and then simulates a process of selecting items to maximize profit. The function maintains a heap of items sorted by their bonuses and updates the current profit and maximum profit as it iterates over the items. Finally, it prints the maximum profit achieved.
