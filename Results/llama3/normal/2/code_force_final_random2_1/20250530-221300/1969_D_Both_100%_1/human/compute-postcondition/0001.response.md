The only variable in the loop head is `test_cases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `combined` is a list of tuples of two integers, `heap` is a list of tuples of two integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `test_cases` is a value returned by `func_1()`, but these states do not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `test_cases` to be at least 1.

State: **`combined` is a list of tuples of two integers, `heap` is a list of tuples of two integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, `test_cases` is at least 1**
