Output State: **`combined` is a non-empty list with at least one item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`, `max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged. `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item`.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the second element of `item` from it. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `combined` still has at least one item, `heap` still contains all tuples from the original `combined` sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is still 0, and `item` is still the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`. The value of `max_profit` is still either equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, or remains unchanged.
