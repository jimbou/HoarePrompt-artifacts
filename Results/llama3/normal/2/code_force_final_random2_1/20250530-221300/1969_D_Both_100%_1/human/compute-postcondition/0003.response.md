According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `heap` is an empty list, `k` is greater than 0, `test_cases` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `prices` is a list of integers, `neg_prices` is a list of negative integers, `bonuses` is a list of integers, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list**
