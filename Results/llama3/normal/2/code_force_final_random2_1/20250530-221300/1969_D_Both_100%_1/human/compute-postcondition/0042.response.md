Output State: **`combined` is a non-empty list with at least one item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` that is either equal to `item` or the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `current_profit` is either equal to its previous value if `removed_item` does not exist, otherwise it is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
