To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(test_cases):`. The only object in the loop head is `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`combined` is an empty list, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 0**
