Output State: **`combined` is a list of tuples of two integers, `heap` is a list of tuples of two integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, `test_cases` is a value returned by `func_1()`**

In this output state, the values of `combined`, `heap`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only assigns the return value of `func_1()` to the new variable `test_cases`. The value of `test_cases` is now equal to the return value of `func_1()`, which is not specified in the initial state.
