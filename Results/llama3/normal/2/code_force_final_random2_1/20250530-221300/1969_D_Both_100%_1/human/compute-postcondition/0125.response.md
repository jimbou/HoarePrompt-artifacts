Output State: **`combined` is an empty list, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `_` is `k` (which is 0).**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `combined` will be empty because all its items will have been moved to `heap`. The `item` variable will hold the last item that was in `combined` before it was removed. The value of `k` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
