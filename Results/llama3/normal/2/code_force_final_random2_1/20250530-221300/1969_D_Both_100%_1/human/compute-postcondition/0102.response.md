Output State: **`combined` is not empty but its size is reduced by 1, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1. If `removed_item` is not empty, `heap` contains `item` and does not contain `removed_item`. `current_profit` was decreased by `item[1]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The size of `combined` is reduced by 1, and `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal. The `heap` still contains all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order. The values of `k`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged. The `current_profit` has been decreased by the second value of `item`. If `removed_item` is not empty, `heap` contains `item` and does not contain `removed_item`. The `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
