Output State: **`combined` is not empty but its size is reduced by 1, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple in `heap` that was replaced by `item`, If `removed_item` is not empty, `heap` contains `item` and does not contain `removed_item`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, then `current_profit` was decreased by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` was increased by `item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the `heap` has been updated by replacing the smallest tuple with `item` using the `heappushpop` function. The `removed_item` variable now holds the value of the smallest tuple that was replaced. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `current_profit` and `max_profit` are still valid.
