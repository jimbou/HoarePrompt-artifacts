Postcondition: **`combined` has one less item than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined` except the last one and the smallest item in `heap` before the push and pop operation, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. If the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]`. If the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0, then `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]`. If `removed_item` exists, then `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`.**
