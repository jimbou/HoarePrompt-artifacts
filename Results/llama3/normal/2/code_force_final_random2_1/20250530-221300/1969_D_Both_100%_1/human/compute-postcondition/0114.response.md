Output State: **combined is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, heap is an empty list, item is the last item that was in combined before the removal, k is the second value returned by func_2(), n is the first value returned by func_2(), prices is a list of values returned by func_2(), neg_prices is a list of negative prices, bonuses is a list of values returned by func_2(), test_cases is greater than 0, remaining_items is an empty list, max_profit is 0, current_profit is 0.**

The code snippet has the following effects on the program state:

*   The `heap` list is reset to an empty list.
*   The `remaining_items` list is initialized as an empty list.
*   The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the first and second values returned by `func_2()`, respectively.
*   The `prices` list is updated to contain the values returned by `func_2()`.
*   The `neg_prices` list is created by negating each price in the `prices` list.
*   The `bonuses` list is updated to contain the values returned by `func_2()`.
*   The `combined` list is created by zipping the `neg_prices` and `bonuses` lists together and sorting the resulting tuples by their bonus values in ascending order.
*   The `max_profit` and `current_profit` variables are initialized to 0.

The `item` variable remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code snippet. The `test_cases` variable also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code snippet.
