Postcondition: ***`combined` is a list, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1. If `combined` is not empty, `max_profit` is 0 and `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `current_profit` is the value returned by func_3(combined, heap).***
