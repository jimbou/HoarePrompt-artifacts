To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1.

State: **`combined` is a list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `heap` is an empty list, `k` must be at least 1, `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `test_cases` must be greater than 1**
