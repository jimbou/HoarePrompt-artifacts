Postcondition: ***`combined` is a list with at least one item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` that is either equal to `item` or the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is either equal to its previous value if `removed_item` does not exist, otherwise it is decreased by the first element of `removed_item` and then increased by the first element of `item`.***
