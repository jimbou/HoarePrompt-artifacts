Output State: **`combined` is a list with one less item than before, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `max_profit` is equal to the maximum of its initial value and the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]`. Additionally, the sum of `item[0]` and `item[1]` is less than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated by adding `item[0]` to its previous value, which was equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the sum of `item[0]` and `item[1]` is still less than 0, as this condition was not affected by the code.
