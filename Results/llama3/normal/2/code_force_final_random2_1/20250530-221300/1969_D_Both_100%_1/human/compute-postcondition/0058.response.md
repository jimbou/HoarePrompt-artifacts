Output State: **combined is a list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, heap is an empty list, k is the second value returned by func_2(), n is the first value returned by func_2(), prices is a list of values returned by func_2(), neg_prices is a list of negative prices, bonuses is a list of values returned by func_2(), max_profit is 0, current_profit is 0, remaining_items is an empty list, and test_cases must be greater than 1**

The code snippet provided modifies the initial state by executing the following operations:

1.  The `heap` list is reset to an empty list.
2.  The `remaining_items` list is also reset to an empty list.
3.  The function `func_2()` is called, and its return values are assigned to `n` and `k`, respectively.
4.  The function `func_2()` is called again, and its return values are assigned to the `prices` list.
5.  A new list `neg_prices` is created by negating each price in the `prices` list.
6.  The function `func_2()` is called once more, and its return values are assigned to the `bonuses` list.
7.  The `max_profit` and `current_profit` variables are reset to 0.
8.  The `combined` list is created by zipping the `neg_prices` and `bonuses` lists together. This list is then sorted in ascending order based on the bonuses.

The final state reflects these changes, with updated values for `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `combined`, `max_profit`, and `current_profit`. The `heap` and `remaining_items` lists are empty, and `test_cases` must still be greater than 1.
