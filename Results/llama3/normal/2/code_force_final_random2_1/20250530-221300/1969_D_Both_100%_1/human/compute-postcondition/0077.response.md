Output State: **`combined` is a list with one less item than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit` which is greater than 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `combined` has been reduced by one item, and the removed item is now stored in the variable `item`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `heap` still containing the sorted tuples, `k` and `n` still holding the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` and `bonuses` still containing the values returned by `func_2()`, and `neg_prices` still containing negative prices. The condition regarding `current_profit` and `max_profit` remains the same, and `test_cases` is still greater than 1.
