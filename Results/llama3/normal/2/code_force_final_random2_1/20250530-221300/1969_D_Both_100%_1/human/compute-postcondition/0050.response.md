Output State: **`combined` is a list with at least one item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `removed_item` is the tuple with the smallest bonus in `heap` that is either equal to `item` or the tuple that was removed from `heap` to make room for `item`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` and is removed from `combined`. `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`.**

In this output state, the values of `combined`, `heap`, `k`, `removed_item`, and `item` remain the same as in the initial state. However, the value of `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the first element of `removed_item` from its previous value.
