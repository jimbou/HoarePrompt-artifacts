Output State: **`combined` has one less item than before, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined` except the last one, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. The state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition, with `current_profit` being equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, or plus `item[0]` otherwise. If `removed_item` exists, then `removed_item` is the smallest item in `heap` before the push and pop operation.**

In natural language, the output state is: The `combined` list has been reduced by one item, and the `item` variable now holds the value of the last item that was removed from `combined`. The `heap` still contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, except for the last one. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
