The only variable in the loop head is variable combined, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable combined.  If combined is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, combined is a non-empty list with one less item, So for the loop to be executed one more time combined must be a non-empty list with at least one item.
State: **`combined` is a non-empty list with at least one item, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`. `max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged. `current_profit` is either decreased by the second element of `item` and the first element of `removed_item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, or increased by the first element of `item` and decreased by the first element of `removed_item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0, or decreased by the second element of `item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, or increased by the first element of `item` if the sum of the first two elements of `item` is less than 0.**
