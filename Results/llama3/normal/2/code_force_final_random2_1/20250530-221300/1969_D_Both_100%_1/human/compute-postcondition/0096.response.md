Output State: **`combined` is not empty but its last item has been removed, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple in `heap` that has a bonus smaller than or equal to `item[1]`, `heap` contains `item` and does not contain `removed_item`, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, then `current_profit` was decreased by `item[1]`, otherwise `current_profit` was increased by `item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the value of `removed_item[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are the same as in the initial state. The conditions related to `item`, `removed_item`, and `current_profit` are still valid, and the relationships between the variables are maintained.
