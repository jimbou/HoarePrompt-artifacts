The only variable in the loop head is variable combined, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable combined.  If combined is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, combined is a list with one less item than before. So for the loop to be executed one more time combined must not be empty.
State: **`combined` is not empty, `item` is the last item that was in `combined`, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the initial `combined` list, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, `k` is the second value returned by func_2(), `n` is the first value returned by func_2(), `prices` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by func_2(), `test_cases` is greater than 1. If `removed_item` is not empty, `current_profit` was decreased by `removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, `removed_item` is the item with the smallest bonus in the heap, which is either the item that was just pushed or the smallest item that was already in the heap. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.**
