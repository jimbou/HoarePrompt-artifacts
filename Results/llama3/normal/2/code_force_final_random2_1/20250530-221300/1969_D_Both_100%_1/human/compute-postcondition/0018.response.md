Output State: **`combined` is a list, `heap` is a list containing all tuples from the original `combined`, sorted by the bonus in ascending order, `k` is 0, `max_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`**

In this output state, the value of `max_profit` has been updated to be equal to the value of `current_profit`, which is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. The values of `combined`, `heap`, and `k` remain unchanged. The relationship between `current_profit` and `max_profit` is also updated, where `current_profit` is now greater than `max_profit`.
