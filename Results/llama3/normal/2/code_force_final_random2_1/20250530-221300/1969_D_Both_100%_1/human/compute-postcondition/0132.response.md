The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `combined` being non-empty. Right before the loop, `combined` is either an empty list or a non-empty list. For the loop to execute the first time, `combined` must be a non-empty list.

State: **`combined` is a non-empty list, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `max_profit` is equal to the maximum of its initial value and the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`**
