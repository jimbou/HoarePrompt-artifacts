Output State: **`combined` is a list with one less item than before, `heap` contains all the items that were initially in `combined`, `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, `k` is 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `max_profit` is equal to the maximum of its initial value and the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and `current_profit` is equal to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`**

The code removes the last item from the `combined` list and assigns it to the `item` variable. The other variables remain unchanged. The `combined` list now has one less item than before, and the `item` variable holds the value of the removed item. The rest of the variables retain their initial values and properties.
