Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: combined is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by bonuses in ascending order, heap is an empty list, item is the last item that was in combined before the removal, k is the second value returned by func_2(), n is the first value returned by func_2(), prices is a list of values returned by func_2(), neg_prices is a list of negative prices, bonuses is a list of values returned by func_2(), test_cases is greater than 0, remaining_items is an empty list, max_profit is 0, current_profit is 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`combined` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by bonuses in ascending order. If `combined` is not empty, it has one less item than before, and `heap` contains the last item that was in `combined` before the removal. Otherwise, `combined` and `heap` remain unchanged. `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal if `combined` is not empty, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `_` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`combined` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by bonuses in ascending order. If `combined` is not empty, it has one less item than before, `heap` contains the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, and `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal. Otherwise, `combined` and `heap` remain unchanged. Additionally, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, and `current_profit` is 0, and `_` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `combined` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a negative price and a bonus, sorted by bonuses in ascending order. If `combined` is not empty, it has one less item than before, `heap` contains the last item that was in `combined` before the removal, and `item` is the last item that was in `combined` before the removal. Otherwise, `combined` and `heap` remain unchanged. Additionally, `k` is greater than 1, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative prices, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `_` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
