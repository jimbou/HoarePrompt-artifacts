Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
import math

func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then for each test case, two integers (the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon and the number of applications with a 2 x 2 icon, respectively).
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: `ap` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is `ap`, `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of applications with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 icons respectively. If `x` and `y` are both greater than 0, `x` is updated to its original value minus the ceiling of `y/2` times 15 plus `y` times 4, and the sum of the ceiling of `x/15` (if `x` is greater than 0) and the ceiling of `y/2` is printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed, and `x` and `y` retain their original values. stdin remains empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the number of applications with 1x1 and 2x2 icons. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total number of blocks required to accommodate the applications, considering the updated number of 1x1 icons after accounting for the 2x2 icons. If there are no 2x2 icons, it prints the number of blocks required for the 1x1 icons. If there are no 1x1 icons, it prints the number of blocks required for the 2x2 icons. If there are no icons of either type, it prints 0. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.
