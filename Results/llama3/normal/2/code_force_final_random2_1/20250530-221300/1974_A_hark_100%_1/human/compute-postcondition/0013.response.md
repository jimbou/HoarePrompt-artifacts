The `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` statement will print the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15. Since `x` is an integer representing the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon and its current value is greater than 0, the division `x / 15` will result in a floating-point number. The `math.ceil` function will then round this number up to the nearest integer.

Output: **the ceiling of the division of the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon by 15**
