Postcondition: ***`ap` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of applications with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 icons respectively. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `x` is updated to its original value minus the ceiling of `y/2` times 15 plus `y` times 4, and the sum of the ceiling of `x/15` (if `x` is greater than 0) and the ceiling of `y/2` is printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed, and `x` and `y` retain their original values. stdin remains empty.***
