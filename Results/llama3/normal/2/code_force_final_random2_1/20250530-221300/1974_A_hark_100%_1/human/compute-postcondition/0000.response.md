The code `ap = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input (the number of test cases) to the variable `ap`. Since the stdin contains two inputs, after this line is executed, the stdin will contain one input (the two integers for the first test case).

Output State: **`ap` is an integer (the number of test cases), stdin contains one input: two integers (the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon and the number of applications with a 2 x 2 icon, respectively).**
