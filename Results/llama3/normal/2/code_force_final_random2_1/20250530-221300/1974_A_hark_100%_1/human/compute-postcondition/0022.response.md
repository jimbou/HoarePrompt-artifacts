Output State: **`ap` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of applications with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 icons respectively, and stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the values of `ap` and `k` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the input values from stdin, which are integers representing the number of applications with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 icons respectively. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers.
