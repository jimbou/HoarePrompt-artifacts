Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when x is a multiple of 15 and y is greater than 0. In this case, the program will print a value that is one more than the actual minimum number of screens needed.

For example, if x = 15 and y = 1, the program will print 2, but the correct answer is 1.

The issue is with the line `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)`. This line assumes that if x is positive, we need to add at least one screen for the 1x1 icons. However, if x is a multiple of 15, we can fit all the 1x1 icons on the same screen as the 2x2 icon, so we don't need an extra screen.

To fix this issue, we need to add a special case to handle when x is a multiple of 15.
