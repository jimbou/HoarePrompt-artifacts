Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ap` is an integer (the number of test cases), stdin contains one input: two integers (the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon and the number of applications with a 2 x 2 icon, respectively).
Code of the loop:
for k in range(ap):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ap` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of applications with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 icons respectively. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `x` is updated to its original value minus the ceiling of `y/2` times 15 plus `y` times 4, and the sum of the ceiling of `x/15` (if `x` is greater than 0) and the ceiling of `y/2` is printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed, and `x` and `y` retain their original values. stdin remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ap` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of applications with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 icons respectively. If `x` and `y` are both greater than 0, `x` is updated to its original value minus bxsfory * 15 plus y * 4, where bxsfory is the ceiling of y divided by 2, and the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is printed, where bxsfory1 is 0 if x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of x divided by 15. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of y divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ap` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of applications with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 icons respectively. If `x` and `y` are both greater than 0, `x` is updated to its original value minus 11 times the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 plus 4 times `y`, and the sum of the ceiling of `x` divided by 15 and the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the smallest integer not less than `x` divided by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
