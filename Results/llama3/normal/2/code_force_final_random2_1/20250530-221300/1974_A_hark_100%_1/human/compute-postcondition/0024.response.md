To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the variables and their relationships based on the initial state.

1. **ap**: An integer greater than 1. Its exact value isn't specified, but it's not directly used in the print statement, so we don't need its exact value for this calculation.

2. **k**: Equals 1. This value isn't directly used in the print statement either.

3. **x**: An integer equal to its original value minus `bxsfory` * 15 plus `y` * 4. Without knowing the original value of `x` or `y`, we can't calculate `x`'s exact value, but we know it's dependent on `bxsfory` and `y`.

4. **y**: An integer. Its exact value isn't specified.

5. **bxsfory**: The ceiling of `y` divided by 2. This means if `y` is an even number, `bxsfory` will be `y/2`. If `y` is an odd number, `bxsfory` will be `(y+1)/2`.

6. **bxsfory1**: 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of `x` divided by 15. This value depends on the calculated value of `x`.

Given these definitions, the print statement `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)` will output the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.

- **bxsfory** is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2.
- **bxsfory1** depends on `x`. If `x` (after adjustments) is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` is 0. Otherwise, it's the ceiling of `x` divided by 15.

Without exact values for `y` and the original value of `x`, we can't compute an exact numerical value for the sum. However, we can describe what the output will be based on the given conditions.

Output: **The sum of the ceiling of y divided by 2 and either 0 (if x is less than or equal to 0 after adjustments) or the ceiling of x divided by 15 (if x is greater than 0 after adjustments)**
