Output: **ap is an integer greater than 0, k is 0, x is an integer equal to its original value minus the ceiling of y/2 times 15 plus y times 4, y is an integer greater than 0, bxsfory is the ceiling of y/2, bxsfory1 is 0 if x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of x/15, stdin is empty, and the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is being printed, where bxsfory1 is either 0 or the ceiling of x/15 and bxsfory is the ceiling of y/2**
