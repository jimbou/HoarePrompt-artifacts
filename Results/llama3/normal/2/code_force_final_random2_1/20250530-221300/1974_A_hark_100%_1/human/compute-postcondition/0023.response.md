Output State: **ap is an integer greater than 1, k is 1, x is an integer equal to its original value minus bxsfory * 15 plus y * 4, y is an integer, bxsfory is the ceiling of y divided by 2, bxsfory1 is 0 if x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of x divided by 15, stdin is empty.**

The code first calculates the ceiling of y divided by 2 and assigns it to bxsfory. Then, it updates the value of x by subtracting bxsfory multiplied by 15 and adding y multiplied by 4. Finally, it calculates the value of bxsfory1, which is 0 if x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of x divided by 15. The values of ap and k remain unchanged. The stdin is empty after the execution of the code.
