Postcondition: ***`ap` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of applications with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 icons respectively, and their values are assigned from the input. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of the number of applications with 2 x 2 icons divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the smallest integer not less than `x` divided by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.***
