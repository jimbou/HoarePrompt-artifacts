The code snippet assigns the values of `x` and `y` from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin is now empty, we won't include it in the output state.

Output State: **`ap` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of applications with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 icons respectively, and their values are assigned from the input.**
