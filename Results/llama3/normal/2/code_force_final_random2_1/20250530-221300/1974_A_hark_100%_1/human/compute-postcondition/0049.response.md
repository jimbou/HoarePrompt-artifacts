Output State: **`ap` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is `ap`, `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of applications with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 icons respectively. If `x` and `y` are both greater than 0, `x` is updated to its original value minus the ceiling of `y/2` times 15 plus `y` times 4, and the sum of the ceiling of `x/15` (if `x` is greater than 0) and the ceiling of `y/2` is printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed, and `x` and `y` retain their original values. stdin remains empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of `x` and `y` have been updated according to the conditions specified in the loop body. The loop counter `k` has reached the value of `ap`, indicating that the loop has completed all the iterations. The input from stdin has been fully processed, and the output has been printed according to the conditions specified in the loop body.
