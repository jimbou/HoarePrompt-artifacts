Postcondition: ***`ap` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of applications with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 icons respectively. If `x` and `y` are both greater than 0, `x` is updated to its original value minus bxsfory * 15 plus y * 4, where bxsfory is the ceiling of y divided by 2, and the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is printed, where bxsfory1 is 0 if x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of x divided by 15. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of y divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.***
