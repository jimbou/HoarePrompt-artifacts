Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. The program takes into account the size of each icon and the available space on each screen.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. It then calculates the number of blocks required to accommodate the 2x2 icons and updates the number of 1x1 icons accordingly. Finally, it calculates and prints the total number of blocks required to accommodate all icons.

The program handles different scenarios correctly:

*   If there are both 1x1 and 2x2 icons, it calculates the number of blocks required for the 2x2 icons and updates the number of 1x1 icons. It then calculates the total number of blocks required.
*   If there are only 2x2 icons, it calculates the number of blocks required for the 2x2 icons.
*   If there are only 1x1 icons, it calculates the number of blocks required for the 1x1 icons.
*   If there are no icons of either type, it prints 0.

The program uses the `math.ceil` function to round up the division of the number of icons by the block size, ensuring that it always allocates enough blocks to accommodate all icons.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles different scenarios as expected.

Correctness: **True**
