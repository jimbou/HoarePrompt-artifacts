Output State: **`ap` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `x` is an integer representing the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon, `y` is an integer representing the number of applications with a 2 x 2 icon, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `ap` and `k` remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the two integers input from stdin, which represents the number of applications with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 icons, respectively. Since the input has been consumed, stdin is now empty.
