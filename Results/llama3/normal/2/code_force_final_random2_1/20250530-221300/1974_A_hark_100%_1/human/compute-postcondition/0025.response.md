Output: **ap is an integer greater than 1, k is 1, x is an integer equal to its original value minus bxsfory * 15 plus y * 4, y is an integer, bxsfory is the ceiling of y divided by 2, bxsfory1 is 0 if x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of x divided by 15, stdin is empty, and the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is being printed**
