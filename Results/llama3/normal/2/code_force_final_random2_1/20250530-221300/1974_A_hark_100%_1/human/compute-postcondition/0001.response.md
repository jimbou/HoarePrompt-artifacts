The only variables in the loop head are variables  k and ap, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ap`. If ap is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, ap is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `ap` is greater than 0 and k is now 0. 
State: **`ap` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, stdin contains one input: two integers (the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon and the number of applications with a 2 x 2 icon, respectively)**
