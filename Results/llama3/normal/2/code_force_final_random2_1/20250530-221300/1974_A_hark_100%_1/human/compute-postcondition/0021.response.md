The only variable in the loop head is variable  k and ap, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `ap`. If `k` is less than `ap`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, `ap` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `k` must be increased by 1 so `k` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `ap` must be greater than 1.
State: **`ap` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of applications with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 icons respectively. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `x` is updated to its original value minus the ceiling of `y/2` times 15 plus `y` times 4, and the sum of the ceiling of `x/15` (if `x` is greater than 0) and the ceiling of `y/2` is printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed, and `x` and `y` retain their original values. stdin remains empty.**
