Postcondition: ***`ap` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers representing the number of applications with 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 icons respectively. If `x` and `y` are both greater than 0, `x` is updated to its original value minus 11 times the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 plus 4 times `y`, and the sum of the ceiling of `x` divided by 15 and the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the smallest integer not less than `x` divided by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.***
