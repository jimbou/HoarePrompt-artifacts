Postcondition: ***`ap` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `x` is an integer representing the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon, `y` is an integer representing the number of applications with a 2 x 2 icon, stdin is empty. Either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.***
