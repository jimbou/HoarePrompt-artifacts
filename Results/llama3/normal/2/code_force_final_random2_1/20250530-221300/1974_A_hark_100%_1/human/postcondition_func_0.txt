This function processes a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the number of applications with 1x1 and 2x2 icons. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total number of blocks required to accommodate the applications, considering the updated number of 1x1 icons after accounting for the 2x2 icons. If there are no 2x2 icons, it prints the number of blocks required for the 1x1 icons. If there are no 1x1 icons, it prints the number of blocks required for the 2x2 icons. If there are no icons of either type, it prints 0. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.
