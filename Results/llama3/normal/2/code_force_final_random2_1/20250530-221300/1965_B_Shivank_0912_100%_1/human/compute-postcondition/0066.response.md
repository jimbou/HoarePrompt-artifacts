Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the largest integer such that `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, `j` is the largest integer such that `1 << j + 1` is less than or equal to `k` plus one, `ans` is a list containing five integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, `1 << j`, and `1 << j`, and the length of the list `ans` which is 5 has been printed, and the five elements of the list `ans` have been printed.**

The code appends the value `1 << j` to the list `ans`, increasing its length to 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains five elements: the original four elements, and the newly appended `1 << j`. The length of the list `ans` and its elements have been printed.
