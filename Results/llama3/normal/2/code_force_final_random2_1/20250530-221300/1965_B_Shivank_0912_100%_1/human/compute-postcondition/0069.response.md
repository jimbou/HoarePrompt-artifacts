Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the largest integer such that `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, `j` is 1, `ans` is a list containing six integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, `1 << j`, `1 << j`, and `1 << j`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending another value of `1 << j` to the list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
