Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), tc is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t - 1 pairs of integers (n, k)**

The code snippet reads a pair of integers (n, k) from stdin and assigns them to the variables n and k, respectively. The value of t is not modified, but the number of pairs in stdin decreases by 1. The variable tc is incremented by 1, and the variable i is initialized to 0.
