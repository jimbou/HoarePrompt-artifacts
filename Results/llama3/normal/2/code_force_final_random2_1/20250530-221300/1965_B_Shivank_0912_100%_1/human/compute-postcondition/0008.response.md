Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is greater than or equal to 8, `i` is 3, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers (n, k)**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`) and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
