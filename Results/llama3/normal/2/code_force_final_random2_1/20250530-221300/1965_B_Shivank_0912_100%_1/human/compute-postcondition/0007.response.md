The variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is an integer between 4 and `n` (inclusive). `k` being between 4 and `n` (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << i + 1`, which is `1 << 2 + 1` or `1 << 3` or 8. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is greater than or equal to 8, `i` is 2, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers (n, k)**
