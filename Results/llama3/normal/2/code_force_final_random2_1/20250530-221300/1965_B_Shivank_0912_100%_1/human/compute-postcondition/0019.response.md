Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and 4, stdin contains `t - 1` pairs of integers (`n`, `k`), `j` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the value of `1 << j`, which is equal to 4, to the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
