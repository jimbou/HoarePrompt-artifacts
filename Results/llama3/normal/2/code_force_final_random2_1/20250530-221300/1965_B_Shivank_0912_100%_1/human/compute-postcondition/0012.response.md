Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, stdin contains `t - 1` pairs of integers (`n`, `k`), `j` is 0. The current value of `j` is not equal to `i`***
