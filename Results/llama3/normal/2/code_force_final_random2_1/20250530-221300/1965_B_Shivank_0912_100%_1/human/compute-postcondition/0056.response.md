Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and either `1 << 20` if `20` is not equal to `1`, otherwise no change in `ans`, `j` is 20, and the length of the list `ans` which is 4 has been printed, and the four elements of the list `ans` have been printed**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of the list `ans` and its elements have been printed, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
