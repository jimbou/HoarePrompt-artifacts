Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 4 and n (inclusive), `i` is 2, stdin contains t - 2 pairs of integers (n, k)**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains `t - 1` pairs of integers, but since `i` has been incremented, it is now `t - 2` pairs of integers.
