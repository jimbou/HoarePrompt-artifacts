To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `1 << i + 1 <= k`. This condition involves the variables `i` and `k`.

Given that `i` is 0, the condition simplifies to `1 << 0 + 1 <= k`, which is equivalent to `2 <= k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.

The other variables in the program state (`t`, `tc`, `n`, and the contents of `stdin`) do not affect the condition of the `while` loop, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), tc is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and n (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t - 1 pairs of integers (n, k)**
