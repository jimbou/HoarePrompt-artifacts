Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing 23 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and 20 integers of the form 1 << j for j in range(20) where j is not equal to i, stdin contains `t - 1` pairs of integers (`n`, `k`), `j` is 19.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ans` contains 23 integers. The first three integers are `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, where `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`). The remaining 20 integers are of the form 1 << j for j in range(20) where j is not equal to `i`. The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the input in stdin remains the same. The loop variable `j` has reached its final value of 19.
