Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), tc is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and n (inclusive), i is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, ans is a list containing 23 integers: k - (1 << 0), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << 0), and 20 integers of the form 1 << j for j in range(20) where j is not equal to 0, stdin contains t - 3 pairs of integers (n, k), j is 19.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the value of `i`. The loop will continue to increment `i` until `1 << i + 1` is greater than `k`. At this point, the loop will terminate, and the value of `i` will be the smallest integer such that `1 << i + 1 > k`. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
