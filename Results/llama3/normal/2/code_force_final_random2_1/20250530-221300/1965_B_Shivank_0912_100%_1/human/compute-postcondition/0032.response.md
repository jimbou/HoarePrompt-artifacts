According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is an integer between 4 and `n` (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << 3`, which is 8. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 8 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing 23 integers: `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and 20 integers of the form `1 << j` for `j` in range(20) where `j` is not equal to 0, `j` is 19, stdin contains `t - 3` pairs of integers (n, k)**
