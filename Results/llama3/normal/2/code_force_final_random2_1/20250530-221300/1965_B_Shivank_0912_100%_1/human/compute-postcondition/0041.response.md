Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << `i` + 1 > `k`, `ans` is a list containing five integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), either 1 << `j` if `j` is not equal to `i`, otherwise no change in `ans`, and 1 << `j`, `j` is between 1 and 19**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `ans` now contains five integers: the first four integers are the same as in the initial state, and the fifth integer is 1 << `j`. The value of `j` is still between 1 and 19.
