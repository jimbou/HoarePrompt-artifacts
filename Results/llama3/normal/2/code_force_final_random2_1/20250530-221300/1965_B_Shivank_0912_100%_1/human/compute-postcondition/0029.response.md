Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), tc is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and n (inclusive), i is 1, ans is a list containing 23 integers: k - (1 << 0), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << 0), and 20 integers of the form 1 << j for j in range(20) where j is not equal to 0, stdin contains t - 3 pairs of integers (n, k), j is 19**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of i has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list ans still contains 23 integers, but the first three elements are now k - 1, k + 1, and k + 2. The remaining 20 elements are still powers of 2, but the power of 2 that was previously excluded (1 << 0) is now included, and the power of 2 that is now excluded is 1 << 1.
