Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << `i` + 1 > `k`, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), and 1 << `j`, `j` is an integer not equal to `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the value 1 << `j` to the list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains four integers, where the first three are the same as before, and the fourth is the new appended value.
