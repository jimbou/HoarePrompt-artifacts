The only variable in the loop head is variable i and k, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and k.  If 1 << i + 1 is less than or equal to k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1 and k is an integer between 2 and n (inclusive). For the loop to be executed one more time, k must be greater than or equal to 1 << 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), tc is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), k is an integer between 4 and n (inclusive), i is 1, ans is a list containing 23 integers: k - (1 << 0), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << 0), and 20 integers of the form 1 << j for j in range(20) where j is not equal to 0, stdin contains t - 3 pairs of integers (n, k), j is 19**
