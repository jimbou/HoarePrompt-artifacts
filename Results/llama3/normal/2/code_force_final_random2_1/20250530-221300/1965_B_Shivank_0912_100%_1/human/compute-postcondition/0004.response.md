The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t - 1 pairs of integers (n, k).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and n (inclusive), `i` is 1, stdin contains t - 1 pairs of integers (n, k)**
