The code prints the elements of the list `ans` which contains four integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), and either 1 << `j` if `j` is not equal to `i`, otherwise no change in `ans`. Where `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << `i` + 1 > `k`, and `j` is 20.

Output: **k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j (where k is an integer between 2 and n, i is the smallest integer such that 1 << i + 1 > k, and j is 20)**
