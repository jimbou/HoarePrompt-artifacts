Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 8 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is 3, `ans` is a list containing 23 integers: `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and 20 integers of the form `1 << j` for `j` in range(20) where `j` is not equal to 0, `j` is 19, stdin contains `t - 3` pairs of integers (n, k)**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains `t - 3` pairs of integers (n, k).
