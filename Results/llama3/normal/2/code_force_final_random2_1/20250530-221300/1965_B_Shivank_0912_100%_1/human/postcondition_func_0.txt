The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers: n and k. For each test case, it generates a list of 23 integers based on the value of k and prints the length of the list followed by the list itself. The list contains three specific integers related to k and twenty integers that are powers of 2, excluding the power of 2 that is closest to k. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
