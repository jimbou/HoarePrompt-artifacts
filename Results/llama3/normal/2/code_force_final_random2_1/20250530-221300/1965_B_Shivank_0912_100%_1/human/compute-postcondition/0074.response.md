The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. The list `ans` contains 23 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and 20 integers of the form `1 << j` for `j` from 0 to 19 excluding `i`. 

Here, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the largest integer such that `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, and `j` is 20.

Since the exact values of `k`, `n`, and `i` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the list `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the 23 elements of the list `ans`.

Output: **k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1 << 0, 1 << 1, 1 << 2, 1 << 3, 1 << 4, 1 << 5, 1 << 6, 1 << 7, 1 << 8, 1 << 9, 1 << 10, 1 << 11, 1 << 12, 1 << 13, 1 << 14, 1 << 15, 1 << 16, 1 << 17, 1 << 18, 1 << 19 excluding 1 << i (where k is an integer between 2 and n, i is the largest integer such that 1 << i + 1 is less than or equal to k, and n is an integer between 2 and 10^6)**
