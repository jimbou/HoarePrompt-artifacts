Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, stdin contains `t - 1` pairs of integers (`n`, `k`).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remains the same as in the initial state. A new variable `ans` is introduced, which is a list containing three integers. The first integer is `k` minus 2 to the power of `i`, the second integer is `k + 1`, and the third integer is `k + 1` plus 2 to the power of `i`. The stdin still contains `t - 1` pairs of integers (`n`, `k`).
