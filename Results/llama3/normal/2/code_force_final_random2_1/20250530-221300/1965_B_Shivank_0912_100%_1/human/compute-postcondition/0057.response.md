According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `1 << i + 1` must be less than or equal to `k`. Since `i` is 2, `1 << i + 1` is 8. Therefore, `k` must be greater than or equal to 8 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is greater than or equal to 8, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and either `1 << 20` if `20` is not equal to `1`, otherwise no change in `ans`, `j` is 20, and the length of the list `ans` which is 4 has been printed, and the four elements of the list `ans` have been printed**
