Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), tc is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), i is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(k), stdin contains t - 1 pairs of integers (n, k)**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` remains 1, `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` remains an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `i` becomes the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `k`, and stdin still contains `t - 1` pairs of integers (`n`, `k`).
