Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t pairs of integers (n, k) where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the first input in stdin, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The remaining inputs in stdin are t pairs of integers (n, k), where each n is between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive) and each k is between 1 and n (inclusive).
