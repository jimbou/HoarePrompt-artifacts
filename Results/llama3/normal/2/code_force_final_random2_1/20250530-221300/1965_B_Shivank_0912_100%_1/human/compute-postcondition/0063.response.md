Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the largest integer such that `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`, `j` is 0, the length of the list `ans` which is 4 has been printed, and the four elements of the list `ans` have been printed. The current value of `j` is not equal to the current value of `i`.**

In this output state, the list `ans` has been updated by appending the value `1 << j`, which is equivalent to 1 shifted left by `j` places, or simply 1. The value of `j` remains 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
