Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << `i` + 1 > `k`, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), `j` is 19, stdin contains `t` - 3 pairs of integers (`n`, `k`).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is updated to a list containing three integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, and `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`). The stdin still contains `t` - 3 pairs of integers (`n`, `k`).
