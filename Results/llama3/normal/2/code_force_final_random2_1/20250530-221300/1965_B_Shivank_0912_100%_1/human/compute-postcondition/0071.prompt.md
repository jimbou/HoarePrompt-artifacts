Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the largest integer such that `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, `j` is 20, and the length of the list `ans` which is 3 has been printed, and the three elements of the list `ans` have been printed.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(20):
    if j != i:
        ans.append(1 << j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the largest integer such that `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`, and the length of the list `ans` which is 4 has been printed, and the four elements of the list `ans` have been printed. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and the length of the list `ans` which is 3 has been printed, and the three elements of the list `ans` have been printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the largest integer such that `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, `j` is the largest integer such that `1 << j + 1` is less than or equal to `k` plus one. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is a list containing five integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, `1 << j`, and `1 << j`, and the length of the list `ans` which is 5 has been printed, and the five elements of the list `ans` have been printed. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`, and the length of the list `ans` which is 4 has been printed, and the four elements of the list `ans` have been printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the largest integer such that `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is a list containing six integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, `1 << j`, `1 << j`, and `1 << j`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing five integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, `1 << j`, and `1 << j`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
