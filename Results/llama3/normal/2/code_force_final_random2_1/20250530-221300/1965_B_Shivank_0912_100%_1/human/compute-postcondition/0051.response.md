To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for tc in range(t):`. This means we can only adjust the states of `tc` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` is 2, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `tc` must be less than `t`. Since `tc` is 2, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 3. The value of `t` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it is greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << `i` + 1 > `k`, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), and either 1 << `j` if `j` is not equal to `i`, otherwise no change in `ans`, `j` is 20, and the length of the list `ans` which is 4 is being printed, and the four elements of the list `ans` are printed**
