The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 20, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not specified, but since it is in the range of 20, it must be between 0 and 19. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << `i` + 1 > `k`, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), and either 1 << `j` if `j` is not equal to `i`, otherwise no change in `ans`, `j` is between 1 and 19**
