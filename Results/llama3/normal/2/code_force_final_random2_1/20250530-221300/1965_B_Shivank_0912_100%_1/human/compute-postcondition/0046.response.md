Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << `i` + 1 > `k`, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), and either 1 << `j` if `j` is not equal to `i`, otherwise no change in `ans`, `j` is 20.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged, while `ans` contains all the powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19, excluding 2^`i`, and `j` is 20.
