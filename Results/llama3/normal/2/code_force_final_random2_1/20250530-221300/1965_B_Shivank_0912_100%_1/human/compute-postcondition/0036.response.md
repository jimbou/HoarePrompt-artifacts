The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of `j`. If the range is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 19, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << `i` + 1 > `k`, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), `j` is 0, stdin contains `t` - 3 pairs of integers (`n`, `k`)**
