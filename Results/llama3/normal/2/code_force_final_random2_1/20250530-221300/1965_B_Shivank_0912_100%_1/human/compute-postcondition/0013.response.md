The code appends the value of 1 shifted left by `j` to the list `ans`. The value of `j` is 0, so 1 shifted left by 0 is 1. Therefore, the list `ans` now contains four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and 1, stdin contains `t - 1` pairs of integers (`n`, `k`), `j` is 0.**
