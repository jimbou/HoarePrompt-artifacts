Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the largest integer such that `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is a list containing six integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, `1 << j`, `1 << j`, and `1 << j`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing five integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, `1 << j`, and `1 << j`***
