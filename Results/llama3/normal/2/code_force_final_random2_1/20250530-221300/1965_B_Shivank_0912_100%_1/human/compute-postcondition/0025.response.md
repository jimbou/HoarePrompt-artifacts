Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing 23 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and 20 integers of the form 1 << j for j in range(20) where j is not equal to i, stdin contains `t - 1` pairs of integers (`n`, `k`), `j` is 19, and the length of the list `ans` which is 23 is being printed, and the following is printed: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and 20 integers of the form 1 << j for j in range(20) where j is not equal to i**
