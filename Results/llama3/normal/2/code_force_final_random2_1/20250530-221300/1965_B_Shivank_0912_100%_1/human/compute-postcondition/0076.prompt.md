Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t pairs of integers (n, k) where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    i = 0
    while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
        i = i + 1
    ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
    for j in range(20):
        if j != i:
            ans.append(1 << j)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing 23 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and 20 integers of the form 1 << j for j in range(20) where j is not equal to i, stdin contains `t - 1` pairs of integers (`n`, `k`), `j` is 19, and the length of the list `ans` which is 23 is being printed, and the following is printed: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and 20 integers of the form 1 << j for j in range(20) where j is not equal to i

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer such that 1 << `i` + 1 > `k`, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k` - (1 << `i`), `k` + 1, `k` + 1 + (1 << `i`), and either 1 << `j` if `j` is not equal to `i`, otherwise no change in `ans`, `j` is 20, and the length of the list `ans` which is 4 is being printed, and the four elements of the list `ans` are printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the largest integer such that `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, `j` is 20, `ans` is a list containing 23 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and 20 integers of the form `1 << j` for `j` from 0 to 19 excluding `i`, the length of the list `ans` which is 23 has been printed, and the 23 elements of the list `ans` have been printed, and the length of the list `ans` which is 23 is printed, and the 23 elements of the list `ans` are printed: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and 20 integers of the form `1 << j` for `j` from 0 to 19 excluding `i`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
