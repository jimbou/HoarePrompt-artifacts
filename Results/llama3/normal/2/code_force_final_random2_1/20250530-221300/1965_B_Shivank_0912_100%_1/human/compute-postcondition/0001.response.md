To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `tc` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), which already ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `tc` to reflect the initial value it will take when the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t pairs of integers (n, k) where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, `tc` is 0**
