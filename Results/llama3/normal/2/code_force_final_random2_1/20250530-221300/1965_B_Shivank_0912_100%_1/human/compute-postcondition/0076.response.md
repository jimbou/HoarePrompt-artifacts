Output State: **`t` is 0, `tc` is `t` + 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing 23 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and 20 integers of the form 1 << j for j in range(20) where j is not equal to i, stdin is empty, and `j` is 20.**

This output state means that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the loop variables have reached their final values. The loop counter `tc` has reached `t` + 1, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The variables `n` and `k` have retained their values from the last iteration, and `i` has been updated to the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`). The list `ans` contains the final values calculated in the last iteration, and the input stream `stdin` is empty since all input pairs have been processed. The variable `j` has reached its final value of 20, indicating that the inner loop has completed its iterations.
