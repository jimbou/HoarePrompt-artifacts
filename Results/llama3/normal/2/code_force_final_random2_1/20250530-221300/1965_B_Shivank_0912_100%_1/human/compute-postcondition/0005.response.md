The variables in the loop head are i and k, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and k. If 1 << i + 1 is less than or equal to k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1 and k is an integer between 2 and n (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, 1 << i + 1 must be less than or equal to k. Since i is 1, 1 << i + 1 is 4. So, k must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 4 and n (inclusive), `i` is 1, stdin contains t - 1 pairs of integers (n, k)**
