The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 20, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the largest integer such that `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, `j` is 0, and the length of the list `ans` which is 3 has been printed, and the three elements of the list `ans` have been printed.**
