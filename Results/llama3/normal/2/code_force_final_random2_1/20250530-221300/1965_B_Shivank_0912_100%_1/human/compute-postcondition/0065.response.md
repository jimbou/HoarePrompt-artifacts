The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 20, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the largest integer such that `1 << j + 1` is less than or equal to `k`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), `tc` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is the largest integer such that `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, `j` is the largest integer such that `1 << j + 1` is less than or equal to `k` plus one, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`, and the length of the list `ans` which is 4 has been printed, and the four elements of the list `ans` have been printed.**
