Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), tc is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), i is 0, ans is a list containing 23 integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), and 20 integers of the form 1 << j for j in range(20) where j is not equal to i, stdin contains t - 3 pairs of integers (n, k), j is 19.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `k` has been updated to the new values read from stdin. The value of `i` has been reset to 0. The list `ans` remains unchanged, but its contents are now based on the new values of `k` and `i`. The number of pairs of integers in stdin has decreased by 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged. The length of the list `ans` and the printed values remain the same, but the actual values printed are based on the new values of `k` and `i`.
