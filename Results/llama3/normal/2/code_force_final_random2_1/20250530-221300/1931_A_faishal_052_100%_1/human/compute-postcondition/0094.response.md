To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the range `3`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if the range `3` is at least 1. Since `j` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`cases` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 0, 2 is greater than 0, `temp` is an empty string, 3 is at least 1**

Note that the state of `j` is adjusted to 0, and the state of the range `3` is adjusted to be at least 1, which is already true since 3 is a constant.
