This function reads a series of integers from standard input, converts each integer into a corresponding sequence of three lowercase letters based on a specific encoding scheme, and prints these sequences. The encoding scheme involves subtracting 1 or 26 from the input integer to determine the corresponding letters. The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer followed by that many input integers. The function prints the encoded sequences for all test cases.
