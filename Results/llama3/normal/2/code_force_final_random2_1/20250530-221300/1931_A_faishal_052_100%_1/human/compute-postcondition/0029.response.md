Output State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, 2 is greater than 0. If `lex` was originally between 1 and 27 (inclusive), `lex` is an integer between 0 and 75 (inclusive), and `arr` contains 1, 1, and 1. If `lex` was originally between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` is an integer between -25 and 50 (inclusive), and `arr` contains 1, 1, and 26 if `lex` was less than 28, or 1, 26, and 26 if `lex` was 28 or greater. If `lex` was originally between 52 and 76 (inclusive), `lex` is an integer between -25 and 50 (inclusive) if it was originally between 1 and 76 (inclusive), and `arr` contains 1 and 1 and 26 if `lex` was less than 28, or 1 and 26 and 26 if `lex` was 28 or greater. If `lex` was originally between 1 and 76 (inclusive) and is now greater than 78, there is no change in the state of the variables.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The variables `cases`, `info`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
* The variable `j` is now 2, indicating that the loop has completed two iterations.
* The variable `lex` has been updated based on its original value and the number of iterations. If `lex` was originally between 1 and 27 (inclusive), it is now between 0 and 75 (inclusive). If `lex` was originally between 28 and 51 (inclusive), it is now between -25 and 50 (inclusive). If `lex` was originally between 52 and 76 (inclusive), it is now between -25 and 50 (inclusive) if it was originally between 1 and 76 (inclusive).
* The variable `arr` contains a list of integers, where each integer is either 1 or 26. The contents of `arr` depend on the original value of `lex` and the number of iterations. If `lex` was originally between 1 and 27 (inclusive), `arr` contains three 1s. If `lex` was originally between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains two 1s and a 26 if `lex` was less than 28, or two 26s and a 1 if `lex` was 28 or greater. If `lex` was originally between 52 and 76 (inclusive), `arr` contains two 1s and a 26 if `lex` was less than 28, or two 26s and a 1 if `lex` was 28 or greater. If `lex` was originally between 1 and 76 (inclusive) and is now greater than 78, there is no change in the state of the variables.
