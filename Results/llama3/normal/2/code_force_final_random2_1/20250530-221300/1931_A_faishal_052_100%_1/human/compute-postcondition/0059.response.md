Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 1, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 1, j is 0, 2 is greater than 0. If lex is less than 28, then arr is a list containing 1, 1, and lex-2, and lex is an integer between -3 and 23 inclusive. If lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, then arr is a list containing 26, 26, and lex-52, and lex is an integer between -51 and -26 inclusive. If lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than 78, then arr is a list containing 26, 26, and lex-52, and lex is an integer between -51 and 25 inclusive. If lex is greater than or equal to 78, then arr is a list containing 26, 26, and lex-78, and lex is an integer between -77 and 0 inclusive.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute twice, and after each execution, the value of `lex` will decrease by 1 or 26, depending on its initial value. The value of `j` will decrease by 1 after each execution, and the value of `arr` will be updated accordingly. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` will contain two 1s and the updated value of `lex`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `arr` will contain two 26s and the updated value of `lex`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52 and less than 78, `arr` will contain two 26s and the updated value of `lex`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 78, `arr` will contain two 26s and the updated value of `lex`. The values of `cases`, `info`, `stdin`, `i`, and `2` remain unchanged.
