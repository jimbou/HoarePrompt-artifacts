To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is at least 1. Since `i` is initialized to `cases` before the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be at least 1 as well.

State: **`cases` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 0, 2 is greater than 0**
