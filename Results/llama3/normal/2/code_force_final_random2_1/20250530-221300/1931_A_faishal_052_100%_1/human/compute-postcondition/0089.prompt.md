Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is an integer greater than 2, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, and a sorted list containing 1, 1, and lex-2 or 26, 26, and lex-52 or 26, 26, and lex-78, i is 2, j is 0, 2 is greater than 0, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cases is an integer greater than 2, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, and a sorted list containing 1, 1, and lex-2 or 26, 26, and lex-52 or 26, 26, and lex-78, i is 2, j is 0, 2 is greater than 0, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), range is at least 1. If lex is less than 28, arr is a list containing 1 and lex is an integer between 2 and 26 inclusive. If lex is 28 or more, lex is an integer between 28 and 78 inclusive, and if lex is between 28 and 51 inclusive, arr is a list containing 26, if lex is between 52 and 78 inclusive, arr is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is an integer greater than 2, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes `lex` and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, and a sorted list containing 1, 1, and `lex-2` or 26, 26, and `lex-52` or 26, 26, and `lex-78`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `range` is at least 1. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is an integer between 2 and 26 inclusive, and `arr` is a list containing 1 and either `lex` or 26. If `lex` is 28 or more, `lex` is an integer between 28 and 78 inclusive, and if `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is a list containing either 26 and 1 or 26 and 26, if `lex` is between 52 and 78 inclusive, `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is an integer greater than 2, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes `lex` and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, and a sorted list containing 1, 1, and `lex-2` or 26, 26, and `lex-52` or 26, 26, and `lex-78`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `range` is at least 1. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is an integer between 2 and 25 inclusive, and `arr` is a list containing 1 and either `lex` or 26 and 1. If `lex` is 28 or more, `lex` is an integer between 28 and 78 inclusive, and if `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is a list containing either 26 and 1 or 26 and 26 and 1, if `lex` is between 52 and 78 inclusive, `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26 and 1. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` is a list containing 1 and either `lex` or 26 and 26. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
