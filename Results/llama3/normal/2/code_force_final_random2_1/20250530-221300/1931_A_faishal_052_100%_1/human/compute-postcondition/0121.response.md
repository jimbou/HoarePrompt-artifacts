To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for j in range(3):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the range of numbers from 0 to 2 (since the range is exclusive of the end value).

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is at least 3, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 2, `temp` is a string containing two characters which are the lowercase letters corresponding to the values of `info[i][0]` and `info[i][1]`, and nothing is being printed.**
