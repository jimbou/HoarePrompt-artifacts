Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 1, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 1, j is 2, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, 2 is greater than 0**

The code snippet has the following effects on the initial state:

*   The first line, `arr = []`, initializes an empty list called `arr`. This does not affect any existing variables.
*   The second line, `lex = int(input())`, reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable `lex`. Since stdin initially contains t-2 integers, after reading one integer, it will be left with t-3 integers. The value of `lex` is now an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive.

All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged. The final state includes the new variable `arr` as an empty list, updates the value of `lex` to an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, and reduces the number of integers in stdin by one.
