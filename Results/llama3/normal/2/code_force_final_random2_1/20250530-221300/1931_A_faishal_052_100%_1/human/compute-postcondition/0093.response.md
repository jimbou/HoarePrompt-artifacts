Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 0, 2 is greater than 0, `temp` is an empty string**

The code assigns an empty string to the variable `temp`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `temp` variable is now an empty string, and all other variables retain their initial values.
