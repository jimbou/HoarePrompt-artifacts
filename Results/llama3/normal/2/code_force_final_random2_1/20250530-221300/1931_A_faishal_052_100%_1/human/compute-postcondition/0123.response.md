Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is at least 3, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 3, `temp` is a string containing three characters which are the lowercase letters corresponding to the values of `info[i][0]`, `info[i][1]`, and `info[i][2]`, and nothing is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The loop counter `j` has reached its final value of 3, and the string `temp` now contains three characters, each corresponding to the lowercase letter of the values in `info[i][0]`, `info[i][1]`, and `info[i][2]`.
