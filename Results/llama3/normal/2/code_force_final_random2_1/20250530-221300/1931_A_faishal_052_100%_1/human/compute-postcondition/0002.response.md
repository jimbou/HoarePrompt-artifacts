The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line initializes an empty list `arr`. The second line reads an integer from `stdin` and assigns it to the variable `lex`. Since `stdin` contains `t` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), the value of `lex` will be one of these integers.

Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 0, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between 3 and 78 (inclusive).**
