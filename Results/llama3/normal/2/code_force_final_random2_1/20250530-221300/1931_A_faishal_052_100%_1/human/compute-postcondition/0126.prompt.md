Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is 0, info is a list containing cases number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains 0 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is cases, j is 0, 2 is greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    temp = ''
    for j in range(3):
        temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
    print(temp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cases` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 3, 2 is greater than 0, `temp` is a string containing three lowercase letters (aaa, aab, aac, aba, abb, abc, aca, acb, acc, baa, bab, bac, bba, bbb, bbc, bca, bcb, bcc, caa, cab, cac, cba, cbb, cbc, cca, ccb, ccc), 3 is at least 1, and the string temp is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is at least 2, `i` is at least 2, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 3, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][0] + 96`, the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][1] + 96`, and the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][2] + 96`, and nothing is being printed, and this is printed: a string containing three characters where the first character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `info[i][0]`, the second character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `info[i][1]`, and the third character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `info[i][2]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` is at least 2, `i` is at least 3, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 3, `temp` is a string containing three characters which are the lowercase letters corresponding to the values of `info[i][0]`, `info[i][1]`, and `info[i][2]`, and this is printed: a string of three lowercase letters corresponding to the values of `info[i][0]`, `info[i][1]`, and `info[i][2]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
