To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for j in range(2):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range of numbers from 0 to 1 (since the upper limit is exclusive).

The current state is:

* `cases` is an integer greater than 1
* `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes `lex` and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26
* `stdin` contains `t-3` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78)
* `i` is 1
* `j` is less than 2
* 2 is greater than 0
* If `lex` is less than 28, then `arr` is a list containing 1 and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 26 inclusive
* If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, then `arr` is a list containing 26 and `lex` is an integer between 2 and 0 inclusive
* If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, then `arr` is an empty list and `lex` is an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive

Since the loop head only involves the variable `j`, we can only adjust the state of `j`. According to the loop head, `j` will take on the next value in the range of numbers from 0 to 1.

Since `j` is currently less than 2, the next value of `j` will be 1 (since 1 is the next number in the range).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 1, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes `lex` and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `t-3` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, 2 is greater than 0. If `lex` is less than 28, then `arr` is a list containing 1 and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 26 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, then `arr` is a list containing 26 and `lex` is an integer between 2 and 0 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, then `arr` is an empty list and `lex` is an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive.**
