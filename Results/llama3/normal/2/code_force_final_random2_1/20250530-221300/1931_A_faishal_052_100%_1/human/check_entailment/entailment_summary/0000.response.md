Reasoning:
The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the encoding scheme described in the problem statement. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer and converts it into a sequence of three lowercase letters based on the encoding scheme. The program uses the correct logic to determine the corresponding letters by subtracting 1 or 26 from the input integer. The program also sorts the array of letters to ensure that the output is the lexicographically smallest word. Finally, the program prints the encoded sequences for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
