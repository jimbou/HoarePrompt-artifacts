To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. In this case, the loop head is `for j in range(3):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. If `j` is less than 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is at least 2, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 2, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96` and the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`**

Note that the states of `cases`, `i`, `info`, and `stdin` remain unchanged, as they are not involved in the loop head. Only the state of `j` is adjusted to reflect the next iteration of the loop.
