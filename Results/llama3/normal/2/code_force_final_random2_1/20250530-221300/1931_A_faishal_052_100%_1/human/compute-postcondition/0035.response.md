Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 1, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 1, j is less than 2, arr is a list containing 1, lex is an integer between 0 and 26 inclusive, 2 is greater than 0**

In this output state, the code has modified the values of `arr` and `lex`. The `arr` list now contains the integer 1, and the value of `lex` has been decremented by 1, making it an integer between 0 and 26 inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged.
