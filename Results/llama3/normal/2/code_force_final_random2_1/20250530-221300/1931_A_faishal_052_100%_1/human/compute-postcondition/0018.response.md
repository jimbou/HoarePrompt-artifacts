Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 0, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is a list containing either 1 or 26 and 26, lex is an integer between -24 and 51 (inclusive), j is 1, 2 is greater than 0. If lex is less than 2, arr contains 1 and 26. Otherwise, arr contains 26 and 26. If lex is less than 26, lex is an integer between -24 and 1 (inclusive). Otherwise, lex is an integer between 2 and 51 (inclusive).**

The code appends 26 to the list `arr` and subtracts 26 from the integer `lex`. The value of `lex` is reduced by 26, which affects its range. The value of `arr` is updated by appending 26 to its original value. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
