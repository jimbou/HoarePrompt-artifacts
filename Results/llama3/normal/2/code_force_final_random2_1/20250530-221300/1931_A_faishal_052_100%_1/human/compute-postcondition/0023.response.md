Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 0, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, j is 2, 2 is greater than 0, lex is an integer between 0 and 75 (inclusive), arr contains 1, 1, and 1 if lex was less than 28, or 1, 26, and 1 if lex was 28 or greater.**

The code appends the value 1 to the list `arr`, and then decrements the value of `lex` by 1. The initial state of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`, which is an integer between 1 and 76 (inclusive). If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` initially contains 1 and 1, and appending 1 makes it contain 1, 1, and 1. If `lex` is 28 or greater, `arr` initially contains 1 and 26, and appending 1 makes it contain 1, 26, and 1. The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, so it becomes an integer between 0 and 75 (inclusive). All other variables remain unchanged.
