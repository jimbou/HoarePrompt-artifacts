Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 2, 2 is greater than 0, `temp` is a string containing three lowercase letters (aaa, aab, aac, aba, abb, abc, aca, acb, acc, baa, bab, bac, bba, bbb, bbc, bca, bcb, bcc, caa, cab, cac, cba, cbb, cbc, cca, ccb, ccc), 3 is at least 1**

The code appends a character to the string `temp` based on the value of `info[i][j]`. Since `info[i][j]` can be 1, 26, or any integer between 1 and 26, the appended character can be any lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'. The string `temp` now contains three lowercase letters, and its possible values are the combinations of the initial two letters (aa, ab, ac, ba, bb, bc, ca, cb, or cc) with any lowercase letter. The other variables remain unchanged.
