The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.

State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26, `lex` is an integer between 2 and 77 (inclusive), `j` is 1, 2 is greater than 0. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` contains 1. Otherwise, `arr` contains 26. If `lex` is less than 52, `lex` is an integer between 2 and 25 (inclusive). Otherwise, `lex` is an integer between 26 and 52 (inclusive).**
