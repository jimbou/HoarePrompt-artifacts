Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 0, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, j is 2, 2 is greater than 0, lex is an integer between -25 and 50 (inclusive), arr contains 1 and 1 and 26 if lex was less than 28, or 1 and 26 and 26 if lex was 28 or greater**

In this output state, the value of `lex` has been reduced by 26, and the list `arr` has been appended with the value 26. The other variables remain unchanged. The range of `lex` has been updated to reflect the subtraction of 26, and the contents of `arr` have been updated to include the additional value.
