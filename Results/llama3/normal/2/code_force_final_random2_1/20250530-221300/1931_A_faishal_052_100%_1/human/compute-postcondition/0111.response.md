Output State: `cases` is at least 2, `i` is at least 2, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 3, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][0] + 96`, the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][1] + 96`, and the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][2] + 96`, and nothing is being printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `j` has reached its final value of 3, and `temp` now contains a string of three characters, each corresponding to the ASCII value of the first three elements of the `i-th` list in `info` plus 96. The other variables remain unchanged.
