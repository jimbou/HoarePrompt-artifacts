Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 0, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is a list containing the integer 26, lex is an integer between 2 and 25 (inclusive), j is 0, 2 is greater than 0**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`, which was initially empty. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, which was initially an integer between 28 and 51 (inclusive). As a result, the value of `lex` is now an integer between 2 and 25 (inclusive). No other variables are affected by the code block.
