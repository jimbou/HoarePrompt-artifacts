Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 1, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 1, j is 2, 2 is greater than 0. If lex is less than 28, then arr is a list containing 1, lex-1, and 1, and lex is an integer between -2 and 24 inclusive. If lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, then arr is a list containing 26, lex-1, and 1, and lex is an integer between 0 and -2 inclusive. If lex is greater than or equal to 52, then arr is a list containing 1, and lex is an integer between 0 and 50 inclusive.**

In this output state, the code has modified the values of `arr` and `lex`. The value of `arr` has been updated by appending 1 to its previous value, and the value of `lex` has been decremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
