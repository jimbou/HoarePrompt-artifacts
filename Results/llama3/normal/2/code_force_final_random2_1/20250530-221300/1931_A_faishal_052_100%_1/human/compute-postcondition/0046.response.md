Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 1, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 1, j is 1, 2 is greater than 0, arr is a list containing 1 and lex-1 if lex is less than 28, or a list containing 26 and lex-1 if lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an empty list and lex-1 if lex is greater than or equal to 52, lex is an integer between -1 and 25 inclusive if lex is less than 28, or an integer between 1 and -1 inclusive if lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 1 and 51 inclusive if lex is greater than or equal to 52.**

The code appends 1 to the list `arr` and then decrements the value of `lex` by 1. The initial state of `arr` and `lex` depends on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` contains 1 and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 26 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `arr` contains 26 and `lex` is an integer between 2 and 0 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is an empty list and `lex` is an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive. After the code executes, the value of `lex` is decremented by 1, and the list `arr` contains an additional element, 1. The other variables, `cases`, `info`, `stdin`, `i`, `j`, and `2`, remain unchanged.
