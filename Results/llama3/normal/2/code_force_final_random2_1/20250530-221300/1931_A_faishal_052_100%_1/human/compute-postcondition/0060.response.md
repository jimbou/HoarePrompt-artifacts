Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 1, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, and a sorted list containing 1, 1, and lex-2 or 26, 26, and lex-52 or 26, 26, and lex-78, i is 1, j is 0, 2 is greater than 0, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78).**

The code first appends the value of lex to the list arr. Depending on the value of lex, arr is either a list containing 1, 1, and lex-2, or 26, 26, and lex-52, or 26, 26, and lex-78. After appending lex, the list arr is sorted in ascending order. The sorted list arr is then appended to the list info. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
