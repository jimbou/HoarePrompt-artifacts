Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 1, 2 is greater than 0, `temp` is a string containing two lowercase letters (aa, ab, ac, ba, bb, bc, ca, cb, or cc), 3 is at least 1**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated by concatenating a new lowercase letter to the existing letter. The new letter is determined by adding 96 to the value of `info[i][j]`, which is an integer between 1 and 26, and then converting the result to a character using the `chr` function. The resulting string `temp` now contains two lowercase letters. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
