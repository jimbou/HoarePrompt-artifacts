According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range `2`. If `j` is less than `2`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 2, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than 2. 
State: **cases is an integer greater than 1, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 1, j is less than 2, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, 2 is greater than 0**
