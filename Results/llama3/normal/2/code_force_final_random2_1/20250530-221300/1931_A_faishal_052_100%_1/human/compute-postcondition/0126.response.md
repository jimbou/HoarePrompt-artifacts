Output State: **`cases` is at least `cases`, `i` is equal to `cases`, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 3, `temp` is a string containing three characters which are the lowercase letters corresponding to the values of `info[cases-1][0]`, `info[cases-1][1]`, and `info[cases-1][2]`, and this is printed: a string of three lowercase letters corresponding to the values of `info[cases-1][0]`, `info[cases-1][1]`, and `info[cases-1][2]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables have reached their final values. The variable `i` has reached the value of `cases`, indicating that the loop has executed `cases` times. The variable `j` has reached the value of 3, indicating that the inner loop has finished executing. The variable `temp` contains the string of three lowercase letters corresponding to the values of the last list in `info`. This string has been printed to the console. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
