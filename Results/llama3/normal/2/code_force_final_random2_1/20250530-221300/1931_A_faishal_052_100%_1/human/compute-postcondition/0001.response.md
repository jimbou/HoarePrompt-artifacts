According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is an empty list, and `stdin` contains `t` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78). For the loop to be executed, `cases` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `i` is 0**
