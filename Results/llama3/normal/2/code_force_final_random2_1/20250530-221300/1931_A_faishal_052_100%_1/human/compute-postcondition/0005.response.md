Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 0, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is a list containing 1, lex is an integer between 2 and 77 (inclusive) and the current value of lex is less than 28, j is 0, 2 is greater than 0**

The code executes two lines. The first line appends the value 1 to the list `arr`, making `arr` a list containing 1. The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1, making `lex` an integer between 2 and 77 (inclusive) and the current value of `lex` is less than 28. No other variables are affected.
