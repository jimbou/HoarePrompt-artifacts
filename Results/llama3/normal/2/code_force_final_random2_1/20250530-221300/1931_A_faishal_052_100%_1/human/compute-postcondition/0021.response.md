Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `j` is 1, 2 is greater than 0. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` contains 1 and 1, and `lex` is an integer between 1 and 76 (inclusive). If `lex` is 28 or greater, `arr` contains 1 and 26, and `lex` is an integer between -24 and 78 (inclusive). If `lex` is less than 52, `lex` is an integer between 1 and 51 (inclusive). Otherwise, `lex` is an integer between 26 and 78 (inclusive).**
