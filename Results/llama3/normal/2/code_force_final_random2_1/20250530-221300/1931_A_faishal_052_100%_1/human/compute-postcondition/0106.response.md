Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is at least 2, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 0, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`, and nothing is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`. Since `info[i][j]` is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive), adding 96 to it will result in an ASCII value between 97 and 122 (inclusive), which corresponds to the lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'. Therefore, `temp` now contains a string with a single lowercase letter. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
