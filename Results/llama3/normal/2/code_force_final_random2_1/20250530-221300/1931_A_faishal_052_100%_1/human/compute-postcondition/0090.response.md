Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 2, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, and a sorted list containing 1, 1, and lex-2 or 26, 26, and lex-52 or 26, 26, and lex-78, and a sorted list containing 1 and either lex or 26 and 1, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), range is at least 1. If lex is less than 28, lex is an integer between 2 and 25 inclusive, and arr is a list containing 1, either lex or 26, and 1, sorted in ascending order. If lex is 28 or more, lex is an integer between 28 and 78 inclusive, and if lex is between 28 and 51 inclusive, arr is a list containing either 26, 1, and 26 or 26, 26, and 1, sorted in ascending order, if lex is between 52 and 78 inclusive, arr is a list containing either 1, 1, and 26 or 26, 1, and 1, sorted in ascending order. If lex is less than 52, arr is a list containing 1, either lex or 26, and 26, sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, arr is a list containing either 1, 1, and 26 or 26, 1, and 1, sorted in ascending order.**

The code appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`, then sorts the list in ascending order. The sorted list `arr` is then appended to the list `info`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
