To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for j in range(2):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range of numbers from 0 to 1 (since the upper bound is exclusive).

The current state is:

* `cases` is an integer greater than 0
* `info` is an empty list
* `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78)
* `i` is 0
* `j` is 1
* 2 is greater than 0
* `lex` is an integer between 1 and 76 (inclusive)
* `arr` contains 1 and 1 if `lex` is less than 28, or 1 and 26 if `lex` is 28 or greater

Since the loop head only involves the variable `j`, we only need to adjust the state of `j` for the loop to execute one more time.

Currently, `j` is 1, and the loop will execute again if `j` is less than 2. Therefore, we can increment `j` by 1 to make it 2, which is still within the range of the loop.

The other variables in the state are not affected by the loop head, so their values remain the same.

State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, 2 is greater than 0, `lex` is an integer between 1 and 76 (inclusive), `arr` contains 1 and 1 if `lex` is less than 28, or 1 and 26 if `lex` is 28 or greater**
