Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 0, 2 is greater than 0, `temp` is a string containing a single lowercase letter (a, b, or c), 3 is at least 1**

The code concatenates the ASCII character represented by the integer `info[i][j] + 96` to the string `temp`. Since `info[i][j]` can be 1, 26, or 1, adding 96 to it results in the ASCII values of 'a', 'b', or 'c' respectively. Therefore, `temp` now contains a single lowercase letter. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
