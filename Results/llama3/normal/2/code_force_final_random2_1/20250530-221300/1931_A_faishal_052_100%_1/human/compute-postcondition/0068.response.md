Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 2, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, and a sorted list containing 1, 1, and lex-2 or 26, 26, and lex-52 or 26, 26, and lex-78, i is 2, j is 0, 2 is greater than 0, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing 26, lex is an integer between 2 and 25 inclusive, range is at least 1**

The code modifies the initial state by appending 26 to the empty list `arr`, making it a list containing 26. The value of `lex` is decreased by 26, making it an integer between 2 and 25 inclusive. No other variables are affected.
