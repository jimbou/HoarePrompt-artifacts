Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 0, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, j is 2, 2 is greater than 0.**

The code appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`, sorts the list in ascending order, and then appends the sorted list to the list `info`. The initial state of `lex` and `arr` depends on the original value of `lex`, which is not specified. However, based on the given conditions, we can determine the possible values of `lex` and `arr`.

If `lex` was originally between 1 and 27 (inclusive), it is now an integer between 0 and 75 (inclusive), and `arr` contains 1, 1, and 1. If `lex` was originally between 28 and 51 (inclusive), it is now an integer between -25 and 50 (inclusive), and `arr` contains 1, 1, and 26 if `lex` was less than 28, or 1, 26, and 26 if `lex` was 28 or greater. If `lex` was originally between 52 and 76 (inclusive), it is now an integer between -25 and 50 (inclusive) if it was originally between 1 and 76 (inclusive), and `arr` contains 1 and 1 and 26 if `lex` was less than 28, or 1 and 26 and 26 if `lex` was 28 or greater.

After executing the code, the list `info` will contain a sorted list of integers that includes `lex` and the original elements of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
