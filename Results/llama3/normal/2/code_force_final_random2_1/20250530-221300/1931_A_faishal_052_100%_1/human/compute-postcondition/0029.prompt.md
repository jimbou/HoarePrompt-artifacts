Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is an integer greater than 0, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between 3 and 78 (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26, `lex` is an integer between 2 and 77 (inclusive), `j` is 0, 2 is greater than 0. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` contains 1. Otherwise, `arr` contains 26. If `lex` is less than 52, `lex` is an integer between 2 and 25 (inclusive). Otherwise, `lex` is an integer between 26 and 52 (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `j` is 1, 2 is greater than 0. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` contains 1 and 1, and `lex` is an integer between 1 and 76 (inclusive). If `lex` is 28 or greater, `arr` contains 1 and 26, and `lex` is an integer between -24 and 78 (inclusive). If `lex` is less than 52, `lex` is an integer between 1 and 51 (inclusive). Otherwise, `lex` is an integer between 26 and 78 (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, 2 is greater than 0. If `lex` was originally between 1 and 27 (inclusive), `lex` is an integer between 0 and 75 (inclusive), and `arr` contains 1, 1, and 1. If `lex` was originally between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` is an integer between -25 and 50 (inclusive), and `arr` contains 1, 1, and 26 if `lex` was less than 28, or 1, 26, and 26 if `lex` was 28 or greater. If `lex` was originally between 52 and 76 (inclusive), `lex` is an integer between -25 and 50 (inclusive) if it was originally between 1 and 76 (inclusive), and `arr` contains 1 and 1 and 26 if `lex` was less than 28, or 1 and 26 and 26 if `lex` was 28 or greater. If `lex` was originally between 1 and 76 (inclusive) and is now greater than 78, there is no change in the state of the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
