Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 2, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, and a sorted list containing 1, 1, and lex-2 or 26, 26, and lex-52 or 26, 26, and lex-78, i is 2, j is 0, 2 is greater than 0, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), arr is a list containing 26, lex is an integer between 26 and 52 inclusive, range is at least 1.**

The code appends 26 to the list `arr`, which was initially empty, and then subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, which was initially between 52 and 78 inclusive. As a result, `lex` becomes an integer between 26 and 52 inclusive. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
