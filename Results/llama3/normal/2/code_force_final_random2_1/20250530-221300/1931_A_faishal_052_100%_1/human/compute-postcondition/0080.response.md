Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer greater than 2, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes `lex` and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, and a sorted list containing 1, 1, and `lex-2` or 26, 26, and `lex-52` or 26, 26, and `lex-78`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `range` is at least 1. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is an integer between 2 and 26 inclusive and `arr` is a list containing 1 and 26. If `lex` is 28 or more, `lex` is an integer between 28 and 78 inclusive, and if `lex` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is a list containing 26 and 26, if `lex` is between 52 and 78 inclusive, `arr` is a list containing 26.**
