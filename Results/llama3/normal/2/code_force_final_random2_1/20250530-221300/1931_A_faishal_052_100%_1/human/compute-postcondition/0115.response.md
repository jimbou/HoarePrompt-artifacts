To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2, and `cases` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes at least 3. The value of `cases` remains the same, which is at least 2.

State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is at least 3, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 3, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][0] + 96`, the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][1] + 96`, and the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][2] + 96`, and nothing is being printed, and this is printed: a string containing three characters where the first character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `info[i][0]`, the second character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `info[i][1]`, and the third character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `info[i][2]`**
