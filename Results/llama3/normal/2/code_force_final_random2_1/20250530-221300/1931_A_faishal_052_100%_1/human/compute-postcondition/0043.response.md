Postcondition: ***cases is an integer greater than 1, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 1, j is less than 2, 2 is greater than 0. If lex is less than 52, then arr is a list containing 26 and lex is an integer between 2 and 0 inclusive. If lex is greater than or equal to 52, then arr is an empty list and lex is an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive.***
