Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer greater than 1, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes `lex` and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `t-3` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, 2 is greater than 0. If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, then `arr` is a list containing 1 and 26 if `lex` is less than 28, or a list containing 26 and 26 if `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an empty list if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 26 inclusive if `lex` is less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 0 inclusive if `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52.**
