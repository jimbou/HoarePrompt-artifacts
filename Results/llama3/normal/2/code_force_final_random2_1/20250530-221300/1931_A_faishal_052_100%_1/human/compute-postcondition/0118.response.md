Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is at least 3, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 0, `temp` is a string containing one character which is the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `info[i][0]`, and nothing is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `info[i][0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `temp` string now contains one character, which is the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `info[i][0]`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
