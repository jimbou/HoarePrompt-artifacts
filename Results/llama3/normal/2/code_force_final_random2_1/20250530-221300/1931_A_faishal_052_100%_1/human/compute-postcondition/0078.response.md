Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 2, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, and a sorted list containing 1, 1, and lex-2 or 26, 26, and lex-52 or 26, 26, and lex-78, i is 2, j is 1, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), range is at least 1. If lex is less than 28, arr is a list containing 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between 2 and 2 inclusive. If lex is 28 or more, lex is an integer between 2 and 51 inclusive, and arr is a list containing 26 and 26, or lex is between 52 and 78 inclusive, and arr is a list containing 26.**

The code appends 26 to the list `arr` and then subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` now contains 1 and 26, and `lex` is reduced to 2. If `lex` is 28 or more, `arr` now contains 26 and 26 if `lex` is between 28 and 51, or `arr` contains 26 if `lex` is between 52 and 78, and `lex` is reduced by 26. The values of `cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, `stdin`, and `range` remain unchanged.
