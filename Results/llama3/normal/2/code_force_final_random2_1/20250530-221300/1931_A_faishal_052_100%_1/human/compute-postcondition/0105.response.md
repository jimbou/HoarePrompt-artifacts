To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the constant `3`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `3` is at least 1. Since `3` is a constant, it is always greater than 0. Therefore, we can conclude that the loop will execute.

The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is initialized to `3` before the loop starts. However, the loop will iterate over the range `3`, which means `j` will take on the values `0`, `1`, and `2` during the loop execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is at least 2, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 0, `temp` is an empty string, and nothing is being printed.**
