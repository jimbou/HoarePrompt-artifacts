Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is at least 3, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 2, `temp` is a string containing three characters which are the lowercase letters corresponding to the values of `info[i][0]`, `info[i][1]`, and `info[i][2]`, and nothing is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include a third character, which is the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `info[i][2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `info` list still contains `cases` number of sorted lists of integers, and `stdin` still contains `cases` integers `n`. The value of `j` is still 2.
