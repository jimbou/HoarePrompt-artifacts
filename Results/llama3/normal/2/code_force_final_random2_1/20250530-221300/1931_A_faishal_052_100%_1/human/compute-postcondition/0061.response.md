The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `cases` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `cases` must be greater than 2.

State: **cases is an integer greater than 2, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, and a sorted list containing 1, 1, and lex-2 or 26, 26, and lex-52 or 26, 26, and lex-78, i is 2, j is 0, 2 is greater than 0, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78).**
