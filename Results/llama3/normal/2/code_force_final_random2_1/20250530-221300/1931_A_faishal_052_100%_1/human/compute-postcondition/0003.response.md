According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range `2`. If `2` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cases` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between 3 and 78 (inclusive). These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `j` is 0 and `2` is greater than 0.
State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between 3 and 78 (inclusive), `j` is 0, `2` is greater than 0**
