Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 0, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is a list containing either 1 or 26 and 26, lex is an integer between -24 and 51 (inclusive), j is 1, 2 is greater than 0. If lex is less than 2, arr contains 1 and 26. Otherwise, arr contains 26 and 26. If lex is less than 26, lex is an integer between -24 and 1 (inclusive). Otherwise, lex is an integer between 2 and 51 (inclusive).**

The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. Since `arr` initially contains either 1 or 26, it now contains either 1 and 26 or 26 and 26. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. Since `lex` is initially an integer between 2 and 77 (inclusive), it now becomes an integer between -24 and 51 (inclusive). The value of `lex` affects the contents of `arr`. If `lex` is less than 2, `arr` contains 1 and 26. Otherwise, `arr` contains 26 and 26. Additionally, if `lex` is less than 26, it is an integer between -24 and 1 (inclusive). Otherwise, it is an integer between 2 and 51 (inclusive). No other variables are affected.
