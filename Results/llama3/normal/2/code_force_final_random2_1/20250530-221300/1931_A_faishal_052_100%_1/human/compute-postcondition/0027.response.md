Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, 2 is greater than 0. If `lex` is less than 52, `lex` is an integer between -25 and 50 (inclusive), and `arr` contains 1, 1, and 26 if `lex` was less than 28, or 1, 26, and 26 if `lex` was 28 or greater. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `lex` is an integer between -25 and 50 (inclusive) if it was originally between 1 and 76 (inclusive), and `arr` contains 1 and 1 and 26 if `lex` was less than 28, or 1 and 26 and 26 if `lex` was 28 or greater. If `lex` was originally between 1 and 76 (inclusive) and is now greater than 78, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
