Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 6, the program outputs "aab", but the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded is actually "baa". 

The issue with the program is that it always tries to subtract 26 from the input number, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach is to find the largest possible letter that can be subtracted from the input number, and then recursively find the remaining letters.

Here is a correct solution:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        for a in range(26, 0, -1):
            for b in range(26, 0, -1):
                c = lex - a - b
                if c >= 1 and c <= 26:
                    print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break
```

This solution works by iterating over all possible combinations of letters and checking if the sum of their positions in the alphabet equals the input number. If it does, it prints the corresponding word. The outer loop iterates over the test cases, and the inner loops iterate over the possible letters. The `chr(a + 96)` expression is used to convert the letter position to the corresponding character.
