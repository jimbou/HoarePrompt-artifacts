Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 1, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 1, j is less than 2, arr is a list containing 26, lex is an integer between 2 and 0 inclusive, 2 is greater than 0. The current value of lex is less than 26**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, making `arr` a list containing 26. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, making `lex` an integer between 2 and 0 inclusive. The current value of `lex` is less than 26. No other variables are affected.
