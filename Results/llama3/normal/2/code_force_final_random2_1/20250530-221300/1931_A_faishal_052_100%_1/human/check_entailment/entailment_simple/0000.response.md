Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The program works by first reading the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads an integer and tries to decompose it into three parts such that the sum of these parts is equal to the given integer.

The program uses a greedy approach to decompose the integer. It first checks if the integer is less than 28, in which case it appends 1 to the array and subtracts 1 from the integer. If the integer is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), it appends 26 to the array and subtracts 26 from the integer. If the integer is greater than 52, it appends 26 to the array and subtracts 26 from the integer.

After decomposing the integer, the program sorts the array and then converts each element of the array to a lowercase letter by adding 96 to it (since the ASCII value of 'a' is 97). The program then prints the resulting string.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from the given integer.

Correctness: **True**
