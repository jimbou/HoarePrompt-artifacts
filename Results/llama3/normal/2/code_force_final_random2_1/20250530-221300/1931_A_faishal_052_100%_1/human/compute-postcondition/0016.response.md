Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 0, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is a list containing either 1 or 26 and 1, lex is an integer between 1 and 76 (inclusive), j is 1, 2 is greater than 0. If lex is less than 27, arr contains 1. Otherwise, arr contains 26. If lex is less than 51, lex is an integer between 1 and 25 (inclusive). Otherwise, lex is an integer between 26 and 51 (inclusive).**

The code appends 1 to the list `arr`, and then decrements the value of `lex` by 1. The initial state of `arr` is either 1 or 26, and `lex` is an integer between 2 and 77 (inclusive). After the code executes, `arr` will contain either 1 and 1 or 26 and 1, and `lex` will be an integer between 1 and 76 (inclusive). The other variables remain unchanged.
