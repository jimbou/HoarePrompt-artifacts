Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 2, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, and a sorted list containing 1, 1, and lex-3 or 26, 26, and lex-53 or 26, 26, and lex-79, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains t-4 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), range is at least 1. If lex is less than 28, lex is an integer between 1 and 25 inclusive, and arr is a list containing 1 and either lex or 26 and 1. If lex is 28 or more, lex is an integer between 27 and 77 inclusive, and if lex is between 28 and 51 inclusive, arr is a list containing either 26 and 1 or 26 and 26 and 1, if lex is between 52 and 78 inclusive, arr is a list containing either 1 or 26 and 1.**

The code appends 1 to the list `arr` and decrements the value of `lex` by 1. The initial state of `lex` is an integer between 2 and 78 inclusive, and the initial state of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`. After the code executes, the value of `lex` is decremented by 1, and the list `arr` has an additional element of 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
