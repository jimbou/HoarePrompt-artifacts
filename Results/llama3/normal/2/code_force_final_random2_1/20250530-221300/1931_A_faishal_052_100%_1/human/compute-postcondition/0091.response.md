Output State: **cases is 0, info is a list containing cases number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains 0 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is cases, j is 0, 2 is greater than 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable "cases" will be 0, indicating that all cases have been processed. The "info" list will contain a number of sorted lists of integers equal to the initial value of "cases". Each of these lists will contain the value of "lex" and either 1, 1, and 1, 1, 1, and 26, or 1, 26, and 26, depending on the value of "lex". The "stdin" will be empty, containing 0 integers. The loop variables "i" and "j" will be equal to the initial value of "cases" and 0, respectively.
