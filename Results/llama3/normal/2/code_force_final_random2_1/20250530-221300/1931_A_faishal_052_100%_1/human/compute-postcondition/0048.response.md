Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 1, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 1, j is 1, 2 is greater than 0, arr is a list containing 1 and 26 if lex is less than 28, or a list containing 26 and 26 if lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an empty list if lex is greater than or equal to 52, lex is an integer between 0 and 26 inclusive if lex is less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 0 inclusive if lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive if lex is greater than or equal to 52**

The code modifies the `arr` list and the `lex` variable. The first line appends 26 to the `arr` list, and the second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. The changes to `arr` and `lex` depend on the initial value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` becomes a list containing 1 and 26, and `lex` becomes an integer between 0 and 26 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `arr` becomes a list containing 26 and 26, and `lex` becomes an integer between 2 and 0 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` becomes an empty list, and `lex` becomes an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive. The other variables (`cases`, `info`, `stdin`, `i`, `j`, and 2) remain unchanged.
