Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 0, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is a list containing the integer 26, lex is an integer between 26 and 52 (inclusive), j is 0, 2 is greater than 0**

The code consists of two lines. The first line appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`, making it a list containing the single element 26. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, which was initially between 52 and 78 (inclusive) and less than or equal to 78. After the subtraction, `lex` becomes an integer between 26 and 52 (inclusive). No other variables are affected by the code.
