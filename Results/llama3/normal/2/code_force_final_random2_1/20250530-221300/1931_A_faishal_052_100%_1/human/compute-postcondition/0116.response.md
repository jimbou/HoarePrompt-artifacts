Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is at least 3, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 3, `temp` is an empty string, and nothing is being printed, and this is printed: a string containing three characters where the first character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `info[i][0]`, the second character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `info[i][1]`, and the third character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `info[i][2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been changed to an empty string, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The program is still in the same state, with the same input in `stdin` and the same output printed.
