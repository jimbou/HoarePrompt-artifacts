Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 0, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, j is 2, 2 is greater than 0, lex is an integer between -25 and 50 (inclusive), arr contains 1, 1, and 26 if lex was less than 28, or 1, 26, and 26 if lex was 28 or greater**

The code block modifies the values of `lex` and `arr`. The first line appends 26 to the list `arr`, and the second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. The initial value of `lex` is between 1 and 76 (inclusive), so after subtracting 26, its new value will be between -25 and 50 (inclusive). The initial value of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`: if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` contains 1 and 1, and if `lex` is 28 or greater, `arr` contains 1 and 26. After appending 26 to `arr`, its new value will be 1, 1, and 26 if `lex` was less than 28, or 1, 26, and 26 if `lex` was 28 or greater. All other variables remain unchanged.
