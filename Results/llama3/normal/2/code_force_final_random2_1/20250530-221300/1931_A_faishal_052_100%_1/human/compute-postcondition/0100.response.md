Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 3, 2 is greater than 0, `temp` is a string containing three lowercase letters (aaa, aab, aac, aba, abb, abc, aca, acb, acc, baa, bab, bac, bba, bbb, bbc, bca, bcb, bcc, caa, cab, cac, cba, cbb, cbc, cca, ccb, ccc), 3 is at least 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variable `j` has reached its final value of 3. The string `temp` now contains three lowercase letters, which are the result of concatenating the characters corresponding to the first three elements of the list `info[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `cases` and `i` still being at least 1, `info` still containing sorted lists of integers, `stdin` still containing integers `n` between 3 and 78, and 2 still being greater than 0.
