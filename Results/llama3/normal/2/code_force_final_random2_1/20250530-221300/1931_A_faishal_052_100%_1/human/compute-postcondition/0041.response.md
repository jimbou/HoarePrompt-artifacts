Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 1, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 1, j is less than 2, arr is a list containing 26, lex is an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive, 2 is greater than 0, and lex is greater than or equal to 26. The current value of lex is less than or equal to 52.**

In this output state, the value of lex has been reduced by 26, and the list arr now contains the value 26. All other variables remain unchanged.
