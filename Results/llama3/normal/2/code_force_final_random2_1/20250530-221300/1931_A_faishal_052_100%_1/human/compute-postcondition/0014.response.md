Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26, `lex` is an integer between 2 and 77 (inclusive), `j` is 0, 2 is greater than 0. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` contains 1. Otherwise, `arr` contains 26. If `lex` is less than 52, `lex` is an integer between 2 and 25 (inclusive). Otherwise, `lex` is an integer between 26 and 52 (inclusive).***
