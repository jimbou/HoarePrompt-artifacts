The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, `cases` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is at least 2 and for the loop to execute again `cases` must be at least 2.
State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is at least 2, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 3, 2 is greater than 0, `temp` is a string containing three lowercase letters (aaa, aab, aac, aba, abb, abc, aca, acb, acc, baa, bab, bac, bba, bbb, bbc, bca, bcb, bcc, caa, cab, cac, cba, cbb, cbc, cca, ccb, ccc), 3 is at least 1, and the string temp is being printed**
