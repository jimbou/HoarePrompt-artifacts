The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `cases`. Since stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `cases` becomes an integer between 1 and 100. The second line initializes an empty list `info`.

Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t integers n (3 <= n <= 78)**
