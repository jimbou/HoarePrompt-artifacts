Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is an integer greater than 1, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 1, j is 2, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, 2 is greater than 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cases is an integer greater than 1, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 1, j is less than 2, 2 is greater than 0. If lex is less than 28, then arr is a list containing 1 and lex is an integer between 0 and 26 inclusive. If lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, then arr is a list containing 26 and lex is an integer between 2 and 0 inclusive. If lex is greater than or equal to 52, then arr is an empty list and lex is an integer between 2 and 52 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is an integer greater than 1, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes `lex` and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `t-3` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `i` is 1, `j` is 1, 2 is greater than 0. If `lex` is less than 28, then `arr` is a list containing 1 and `lex-1`, and `lex` is an integer between -1 and 25 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, then `arr` is a list containing 26 and `lex-1`, and `lex` is an integer between 1 and -1 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, then `arr` is an empty list and `lex` is an integer between 1 and 51 inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` is an integer greater than 1, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes `lex` and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `t-3` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, 2 is greater than 0. If `lex` is less than 28, then `arr` is a list containing 1, `lex-1`, and either 1 or 26, and `lex` is an integer between -2 and 24 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, then `arr` is a list containing 26, `lex-1`, and either 1 or 26, and `lex` is an integer between -25 and 0 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52 and less than 78, then `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26, and `lex` is an integer between -25 and 50 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 78, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
