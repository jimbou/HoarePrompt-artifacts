Output State: **cases is an integer greater than 1, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers that includes lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, stdin contains t-3 integers n (3 <= n <= 78), i is 1, j is 1, 2 is greater than 0, arr is a list containing 1 and 26 and lex is an integer between -1 and 25 inclusive if lex was less than 28, arr is a list containing 26 and 26 and lex is an integer between -24 and -1 inclusive if lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, arr is a list containing 26 and lex is an integer between -24 and 26 inclusive if lex was greater than or equal to 52.**

In this output state, the code has appended 26 to the list `arr` and subtracted 26 from the value of `lex`. The initial state of `arr` and `lex` depended on the value of `lex`, which was between 0 and 26 inclusive, between 2 and 0 inclusive, or between 2 and 52 inclusive. After the code execution, the value of `lex` has been reduced by 26, and the list `arr` now contains an additional element, 26. The other variables, `cases`, `info`, `stdin`, `i`, `j`, and 2, remain unchanged.
