Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is at least 3, `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted lists of integers that include lex and 1, 1, and 1 or 1, 1, and 26 or 1, 26, and 26, `stdin` contains `cases` integers `n` (3 <= `n` <= 78), `j` is 1, `temp` is a string containing two characters which are the lowercase letters corresponding to the values of `info[i][0]` and `info[i][1]`, and nothing is being printed.**

Explanation: The code appends a character to the string `temp` based on the value of `info[i][j]`. Since `j` is 1, it appends the character corresponding to the second element of the list at index `i` in `info`. The second element can be 1 or 26. If it's 1, the character appended is 'a' (since 1 + 96 = 97, which is the ASCII value of 'a'). If it's 26, the character appended is 'z' (since 26 + 96 = 122, which is the ASCII value of 'z'). The other variables remain unchanged.
