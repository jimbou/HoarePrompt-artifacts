To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`, which means `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1.

The state of `num` is not changed by the loop head, so it remains a string representing a non-negative integer with at least 2 characters.

The state of `tot` is not related to the loop head, so it remains 1.

The condition `if the current value of `num[i]` is not '0', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, no change occurs` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to consider it when adjusting the state.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be decremented by 1.

State: **`num` is a string representing a non-negative integer with at least 2 characters, `tot` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 2`**
