The value of `tot` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `tot` was 1, so the new value of `tot` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The character at index `i` in `num` is still not '0', so we are still breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing a non-negative integer with at least 2 characters, `tot` is 2, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
