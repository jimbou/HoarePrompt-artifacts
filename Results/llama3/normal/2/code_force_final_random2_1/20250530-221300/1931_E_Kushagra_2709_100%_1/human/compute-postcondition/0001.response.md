To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`. The loop will execute if `num` has at least 2 characters (since the range starts from `len(num) - 1` and goes down to `-1`). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `num` to have at least 2 characters.

State: **`num` is a string representing a non-negative integer with at least 2 characters, `tot` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
