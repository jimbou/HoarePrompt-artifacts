Output State: **`num` is a string representing a non-negative integer with at least 3 characters, `tot` is 2, `i` is `len(num) - 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `num`, `tot`, and `i` remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not affect their values. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
