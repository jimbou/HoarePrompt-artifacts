Output State: **`num` is a string representing a non-negative integer with at least 2 characters, `tot` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, and the current value of `num[i]` is not '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `num`, `tot`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement that we were directly inside. The condition that `num[i]` is not '0' is still valid, as the value of `i` and `num` has not changed.
