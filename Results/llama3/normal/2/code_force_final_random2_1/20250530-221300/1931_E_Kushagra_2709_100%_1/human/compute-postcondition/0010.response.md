To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1.

The current state is:
- `num` is a string representing a non-negative integer with at least 2 characters.
- `tot` is 2.
- `i` is `len(num) - 2`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we only need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`.

Since `i` decreases by 1 in each iteration, its new value will be `len(num) - 2 - 1 = len(num) - 3`.

The length of `num` does not change, but since `i` is now `len(num) - 3`, we can infer that `num` still has at least 3 characters (because `i` is still non-negative).

The value of `tot` is not affected by the loop head, so it remains 2.

State: **`num` is a string representing a non-negative integer with at least 3 characters, `tot` is 2, `i` is `len(num) - 3`**
