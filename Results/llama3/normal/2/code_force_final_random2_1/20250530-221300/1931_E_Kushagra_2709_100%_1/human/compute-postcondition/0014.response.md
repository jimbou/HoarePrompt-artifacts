Output State: **num is a string representing a non-negative integer, tot is the number of trailing zeros in num, and i is -1**.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same value for `num` as in the initial state, since the loop does not modify `num`. The value of `tot` will be equal to the number of trailing zeros in `num`, because the loop increments `tot` for each trailing zero it encounters. The value of `i` will be -1, because the loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to -1.
