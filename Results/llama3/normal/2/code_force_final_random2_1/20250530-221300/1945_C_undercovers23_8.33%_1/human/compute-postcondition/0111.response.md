The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list lst, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lst.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, lst has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the elem is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `lst` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `mini` is the minimum of `pow(10, 8)` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last element in the list, `i` is `n-1`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `final` is a list containing the first element in the list if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list is equal to `mini`, and the second element in the list if the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in the list is equal to `mini`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `(zero * 100 / (n-1))`, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `((o - one) * 100 / 1)`, elem is the third element in the list.**
