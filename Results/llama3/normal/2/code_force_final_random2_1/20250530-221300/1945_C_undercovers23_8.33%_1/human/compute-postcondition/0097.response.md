Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n-1`, `mini` is the minimum of `pow(10, 8)` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst`, `i` is `n-1`, `ele` is the first element in the list, `final` is an empty list, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `(zero * 100 / (n-1))`, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `((o - one) * 100 / 1)`.**

The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum of its current value (`pow(10, 8)`) and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.
