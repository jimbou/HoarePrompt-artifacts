Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, s is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, pk is an integer equal to n // 2 if n is even, or n // 2 - 1 if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 0, one is 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is 0, lst is either an empty list or a list containing the integer 1, mini is 100000000, i is 0, and either the current value of zero_perc is less than 50 or the current value of one_perc is less than 50, where zero_perc is 100 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 0, and one_perc is math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - 1)).***
