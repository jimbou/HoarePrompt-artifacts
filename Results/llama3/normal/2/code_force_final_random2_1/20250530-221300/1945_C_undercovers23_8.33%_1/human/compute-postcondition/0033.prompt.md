Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, s is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If n is even, pk is an integer equal to n // 2. If n is odd, pk is an integer equal to half of n minus 1. sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is 0, one is 0, lst is an empty list, mini is 100000000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, s is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, pk is an integer equal to n // 2 if n is even, or n // 2 - 1 if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 0, one is 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is 0, lst is either an empty list or a list containing the integer 1, mini is 100000000, i is 0, and either the current value of zero_perc is less than 50 or the current value of one_perc is less than 50, where zero_perc is 100 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 0, and one_perc is math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - 1)).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s` plus one if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is the same, `z` is the number of '0's in `s` and is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is the same, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 0, `lst` is either an empty list or a list containing the integers 1 and `i + 1`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, and either the current value of `zero_perc` is less than 50 or the current value of `one_perc` is less than 50. If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is updated to contain the integers 1 and `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, s is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, pk is an integer equal to n // 2 if n is even, or n // 2 - 1 if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s plus one if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is the same, z is the number of '0's in s and is increased by 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is the same, zero is 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it is 0, one is 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it is 0 and is now increased by 1, lst is either an empty list or a list containing the integers 1 and i + 1, mini is 100000000, i is 2, zero_perc is math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)), one_perc is math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)), and either the current value of zero_perc is less than 50 or the current value of one_perc is less than 50. If both zero_perc and one_perc are greater than or equal to 50, lst is updated to contain the integers 1 and i + 1. If s[i] is '0', then zero is increased by 1. If s[i] is '1', then one is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
