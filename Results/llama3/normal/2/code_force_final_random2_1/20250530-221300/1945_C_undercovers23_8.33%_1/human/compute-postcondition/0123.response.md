Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `lst` is a list that must have at least `len(lst)` elements, `mini` is the minimum of `pow(10, 8)` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last element in the list, `i` is `n-1`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in the list if the absolute difference between `pk` and the element in the list is equal to `mini`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `(zero * 100 / (n-1))`, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `((o - one) * 100 / 1)`, `elem` is the last element in the list, `c1` is the integer part of `o * 100 / n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains an additional element 0. Otherwise, `final` contains `n`.***
