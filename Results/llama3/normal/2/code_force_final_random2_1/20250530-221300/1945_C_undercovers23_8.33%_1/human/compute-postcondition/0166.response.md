The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list  lst, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lst.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, lst is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the elem is the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', otherwise it is 0, `lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `mini` is the minimum of `pow(10, 8)` and `min(abs(pk - ele), abs(pk - ele))` and `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))` and `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))` and ... and `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `i` is 0, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `final` is an empty list, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `zero * 100 / (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `(o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)` if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is the ceiling of `(o + 1 - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)`, `c1` is the integer part of `o * 100 / n` if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is the integer part of `(o + 1) * 100 / n`.**
