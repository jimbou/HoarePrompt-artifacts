Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, `pk` is an integer equal to half of `n` minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `pk` is calculated as `n // 2`, which is equal to half of `n` minus 1 since `n` is an odd number. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
