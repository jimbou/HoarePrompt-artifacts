The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list lst, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lst.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, s is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, pk is an integer equal to n // 2 if n is even, or n // 2 - 1 if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is the number of '0's in the first n-1 characters of s, one is the number of '1's in the first n-1 characters of s, mini is the minimum of pow(10, 8) and the absolute difference between pk and the last element in the list, i is n-1, ele is the last element in the list, final is an empty list, zero_perc is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (n-1)), one_perc is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / 1). So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the elem is the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `mini` is the minimum of `pow(10, 8)` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last element in the list, `i` is `n-1`, `ele` is the last element in the list, `final` is an empty list, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `(zero * 100 / (n-1))`, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `((o - one) * 100 / 1)`, elem is the first element in the list**
