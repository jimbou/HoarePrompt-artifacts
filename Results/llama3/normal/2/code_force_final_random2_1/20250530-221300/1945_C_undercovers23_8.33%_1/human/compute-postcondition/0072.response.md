Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is `pow(10, 8)`, `i` is 0, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(1 * 100 / (0 + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - 0) * 100 / (n - 0 - 1))`, `ele` is `None`, `final` is an empty list.**

The code increments the value of `zero` by 1, since the current value of `s[i]` is '0'. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `zero_perc` is updated to `math.ceil(1 * 100 / (0 + 1))`, which is equivalent to `math.ceil(100 / 1)`, resulting in `100`. The value of `one_perc` remains the same, as `o` and `n` are not changed.
