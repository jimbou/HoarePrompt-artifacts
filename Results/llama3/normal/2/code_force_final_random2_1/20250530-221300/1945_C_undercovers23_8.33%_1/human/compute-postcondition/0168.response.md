Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', otherwise it is 0, `lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `mini` is the minimum of `pow(10, 8)` and `min(abs(pk - ele), abs(pk - ele))` and `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))` and `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))` and ... and `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))` for all elements `ele` in `lst`, `i` is 0, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `zero * 100 / (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `(o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)` if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is the ceiling of `(o + 1 - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)`, `c1` is the integer part of `o * 100 / n` if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is the integer part of `(o + 1) * 100 / n`. The current value of `mini` is equal to the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `final` now contains the first element of the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
