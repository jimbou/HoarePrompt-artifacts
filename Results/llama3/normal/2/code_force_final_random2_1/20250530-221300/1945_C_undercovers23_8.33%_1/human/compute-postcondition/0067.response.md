Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, s is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, pk is an integer equal to n // 2, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is the number of '0's in s up to the last index i, one is the number of '1's in s up to the last index i, lst is a list containing indices i + 1 where both zero_perc and one_perc are greater than or equal to 50, mini is the minimum of the current mini and the absolute difference between pk and the last element in the list lst, i is n - 2, zero_perc is math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)), one_perc is math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)), ele is the last element in the list, final is a sorted list containing all indices i + 1 where both zero_perc and one_perc are greater than or equal to 50 and the absolute difference between pk and the index is equal to mini. If final is empty, then if c1 is greater than or equal to 50, final contains an additional element 0. If c1 is less than 50, n is appended to the list final, and the first element of the list final is printed.**

The value of pk is updated to be n // 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
