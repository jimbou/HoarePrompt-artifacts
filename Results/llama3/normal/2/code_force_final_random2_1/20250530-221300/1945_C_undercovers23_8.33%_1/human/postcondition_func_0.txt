This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (n) and a string (s) of 0s and 1s of the same length as n. It then calculates the percentage of 0s and 1s in the first n-1 characters of the string and checks if the percentage of 0s is greater than or equal to 50 and the percentage of 1s is also greater than or equal to 50. If this condition is met, it adds the current index to a list. After processing the entire string, it finds the minimum absolute difference between the middle index of the string (pk) and the indices in the list. If no such indices are found, it checks if the percentage of 1s in the entire string is greater than or equal to 50 and adds 0 or n to the list accordingly. Finally, it prints the smallest index in the list.
