To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is already an integer greater than or equal to 3, we can conclude that `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0 (since it's the first iteration).

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (greater than or equal to 3) and then a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as the integer.**
