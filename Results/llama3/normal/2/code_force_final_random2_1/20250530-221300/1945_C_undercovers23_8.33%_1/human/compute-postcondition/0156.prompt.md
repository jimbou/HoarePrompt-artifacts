Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, s is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, pk is an integer equal to n // 2 if n is even, or n // 2 - 1 if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is 0, one is 0, lst is an empty list, mini is pow(10, 8), i is n-1, ele is undefined, final is undefined, zero_perc is undefined, one_perc is undefined, elem is undefined, c1 is the integer part of o * 100 / n. If c1 is greater than or equal to 50, final contains an additional element 0. Otherwise, final contains n, and the first element of the final list is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', otherwise it is 0, `lst` is a list containing the integer 1, `mini` is pow(10, 8), `i` is 0, `ele` is undefined, `final` contains either `n` or an additional element 0, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `zero * 100 / (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is the ceiling of (`o - one`) * 100 / (`n - i - 1`), `c1` is the integer part of `o * 100 / n`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` contains either `n` or an additional element 0. Otherwise, `final` contains `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, s is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, pk is an integer equal to n // 2 if n is even, or n // 2 - 1 if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s plus one if the character at index i in string s is '1', otherwise it is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s and is increased by 1 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is the number of '0's in s, zero is 1 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 0, one is 1 if the character at index i in string s is '1', otherwise it is 0, lst is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, mini is pow(10, 8), i is 1, ele is undefined, final contains either n or an additional element 0, zero_perc is the ceiling of zero * 100 / (i + 1), one_perc is the ceiling of (o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1) if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is the ceiling of (o + 1 - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1), c1 is the integer part of o * 100 / n if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is the integer part of (o + 1) * 100 / n. If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then final contains either n or an additional element 0. Otherwise, final contains n.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s` plus one if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', otherwise it is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s` plus one if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', otherwise it is 0, `lst` is a list containing the integers 1, 2, and 3, `mini` is `pow(10, 8)`, `i` is 2, `ele` is undefined, `final` contains either `n` or an additional element 0, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `zero * 100 / (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `(o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)` if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is the ceiling of `(o + 1 - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)`, `c1` is the integer part of `o * 100 / n` if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise it is the integer part of `(o + 1) * 100 / n`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` contains either `n` or an additional element 0. Otherwise, `final` contains `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
