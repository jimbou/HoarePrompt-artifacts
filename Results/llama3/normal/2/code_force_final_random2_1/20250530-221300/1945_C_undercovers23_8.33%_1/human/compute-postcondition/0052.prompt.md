Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s` up to the last index `i`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s` up to the last index `i`, `lst` is a list containing the indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last element in the list `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `ele` is the last element in the list, and either the current value of `zero_perc` is less than 50 or the current value of `one_perc` is less than 50, `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s` up to the last index `i`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s` up to the last index `i`, `lst` is a list containing at least 1 index `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last element in the list `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `ele` is the last element in the list, and either the current value of `zero_perc` is less than 50 or the current value of `one_perc` is less than 50. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the first element in the list `lst` which is equal to `pk` plus or minus `mini`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s` up to the last index `i`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s` up to the last index `i`, `lst` is a list containing at least 2 indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last element in the list `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `ele` is the second element in the list. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the first element in the list `lst` which is equal to `pk` plus or minus `mini` and the last element appended is `elem`. Otherwise, no change is made to `final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s` up to the last index `i`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s` up to the last index `i`, `lst` is a list containing at least 3 indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last element in the list `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `ele` is the third element in the list. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list `lst` is equal to `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the first element in the list `lst` which is equal to `pk` plus or minus `mini` and the last element appended is `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
