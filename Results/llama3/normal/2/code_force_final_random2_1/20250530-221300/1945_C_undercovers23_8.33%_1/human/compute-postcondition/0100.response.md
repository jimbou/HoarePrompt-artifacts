The only variable in the loop head is variable  ele, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lst.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, lst has at least 2 elements, ele is the second element in the list, i is n-1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the ele is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing the integers from 2 to `n-1`, `mini` is the minimum of `pow(10, 8)` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in the list, `i` is `n-1`, `ele` is the third element in the list, `final` is an empty list, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `(zero * 100 / (n-1))`, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `((o - one) * 100 / 1)`**
