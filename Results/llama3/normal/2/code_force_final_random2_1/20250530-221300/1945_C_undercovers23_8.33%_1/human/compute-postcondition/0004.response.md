Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the value of `pk` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by 2, which is equivalent to the integer part of `n` divided by 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
