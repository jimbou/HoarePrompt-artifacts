Based on the precondition, we can determine the value of `final[0]` as follows:

* `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in the list if the absolute difference between `pk` and the element in the list is equal to `mini`.
* `mini` is the minimum of `pow(10, 8)` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last element in the list.
* `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd.
* `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `pk` will always be less than `n`. Therefore, the absolute difference between `pk` and the last element in the list will always be less than `n`.

Now, let's consider the two possible cases:

Case 1: `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.

In this case, `final` contains an additional element 0. Since `final` is a sorted list, the first element `final[0]` will be 0.

Case 2: `c1` is less than 50.

In this case, `final` contains `n`. Since `final` is a sorted list, the first element `final[0]` will be `n`.

Therefore, the output will be either 0 or `n`, depending on the value of `c1`.

Output: **0 if c1 is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise n**
