Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s` plus one if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is the same, `z` is the number of '0's in `s` and is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is the same, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 0 and is now increased by 1, `lst` is either an empty list or a list containing the integers 1 and `i + 1`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, and either the current value of `zero_perc` is less than 50 or the current value of `one_perc` is less than 50. If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is updated to contain the integers 1 and `i + 1`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is '1', then `one` is increased by 1.***
