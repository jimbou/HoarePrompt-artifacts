Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, s is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, pk is an integer equal to n // 2 if n is even, or n // 2 - 1 if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is 1 if the character at index i in string s is '0', otherwise it is 0, one is 1 if the character at index i in string s is '1', otherwise it is 0, lst is an empty list, mini is pow(10, 8), i is 0, ele is undefined, final is undefined, zero_perc is the ceiling of zero * 100 / (i + 1), one_perc is the ceiling of (o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1), c1 is the integer part of o * 100 / n. If c1 is greater than or equal to 50, final contains an additional element 0. Otherwise, final contains n, and the first element of the final list is printed.**
