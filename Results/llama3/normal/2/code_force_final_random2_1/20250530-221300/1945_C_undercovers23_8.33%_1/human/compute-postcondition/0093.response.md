Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `i` is 2, `ele` is None, `final` is an empty list, `mini` is pow(10, 8). If `s[i]` is '0', then `z` is the number of '0's in `s` increased by 1, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`i` + 1)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - `i` - 1)). If `s[i]` is '1', then `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s` increased by 1, `zero` is 0, `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`i` + 1)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - `i` - 1)). `lst` is a list containing the integer 1 and the value of `i` + 1.**

The code appends the value of `i` + 1 to the list `lst`. Since the condition for appending is not explicitly given, we assume that the condition is always true, and `lst` will contain the integer 1 and the value of `i` + 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
