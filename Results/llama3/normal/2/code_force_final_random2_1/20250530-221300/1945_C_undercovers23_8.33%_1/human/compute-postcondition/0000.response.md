The code accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (greater than or equal to 3) and then a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as the integer. The first input of the first test case is assigned into t. So stdin now contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (greater than or equal to 3) and then a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as the integer. The first input of the first test case is removed from stdin. Therefore, the Output State is: t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (greater than or equal to 3) and then a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as the integer.
Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (greater than or equal to 3) and then a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as the integer.**
