Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, s is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, pk is an integer equal to n // 2 if n is even, or n // 2 - 1 if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is 0, one is 0, lst is an empty list, mini is pow(10, 8), i is n - 2, zero_perc is math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)), one_perc is math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)), ele is None, final is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 0, if the current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing the integer 1, otherwise `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is pow(10, 8), `i` is 0, `ele` is None, `final` is an empty list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 0, if the current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing the integer 1 and the value of `i + 1`, otherwise `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is pow(10, 8), `i` is 1, `ele` is None, `final` is an empty list, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`i` + 1)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - `i` - 1)).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, s is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, pk is an integer equal to n // 2 if n is even, or n // 2 - 1 if n is odd, sl is a list of characters in s, i is 2, ele is None, final is an empty list, mini is pow(10, 8). If s[i] is '0', then z is the number of '0's in s increased by 1, o is the number of '1's in s, zero is 1, one is 0, zero_perc is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 1)), one_perc is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)). If s[i] is '1', then z is the number of '0's in s, o is the number of '1's in s increased by 1, zero is 0, one is 1, zero_perc is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 1)), one_perc is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)). If the current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then lst is a list containing the integer 1 and the value of i + 1. Otherwise, lst is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
