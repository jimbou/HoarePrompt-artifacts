To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `lst`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ele` is the first element in the list `lst`, and `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `lst` must have at least one more element, and `ele` must be the next element in the list.

Since `lst` is a list of integers from 1 to `n-1`, the next element in the list would be `n-1` if `n` is even, or `n-2` if `n` is odd.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n-1` characters of `s`, `lst` is a list containing the integers from 2 to `n-1`, `mini` is the minimum of `pow(10, 8)` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in `lst`, `i` is `n-1`, `ele` is the second element in the list, `final` is an empty list, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `(zero * 100 / (n-1))`, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `((o - one) * 100 / 1)`**
