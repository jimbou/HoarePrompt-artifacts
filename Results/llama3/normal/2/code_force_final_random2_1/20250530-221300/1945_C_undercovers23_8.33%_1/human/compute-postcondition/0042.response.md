To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `lst`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. Since `lst` is a list containing the indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, we need to adjust the state of `lst` to have at least 1 element.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s` up to the last index `i`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s` up to the last index `i`, `lst` is a list containing at least 1 index `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last element in the list `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `ele` is the last element in the list, and either the current value of `zero_perc` is less than 50 or the current value of `one_perc` is less than 50, `final` is an empty list, `elem` is the first element in the list `lst`**
