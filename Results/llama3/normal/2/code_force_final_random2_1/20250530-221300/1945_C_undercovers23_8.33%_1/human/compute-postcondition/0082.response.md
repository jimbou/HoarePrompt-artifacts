Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 0, if the current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing the integer 1, otherwise `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is pow(10, 8), `i` is 1, `ele` is None, `final` is an empty list, `one` is increased by 1, `o` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `one` and `o` has been increased by 1, while the values of all other variables remain unchanged.
