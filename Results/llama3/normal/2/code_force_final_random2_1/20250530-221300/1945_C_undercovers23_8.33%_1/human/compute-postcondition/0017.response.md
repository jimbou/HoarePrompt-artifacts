Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it is 0, `lst` is a list containing the integer 1, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0, the current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, where `zero_perc` is 100 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it is 0, and `one_perc` is math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - 1)).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `lst` now contains the integer 1, which is the value of `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
