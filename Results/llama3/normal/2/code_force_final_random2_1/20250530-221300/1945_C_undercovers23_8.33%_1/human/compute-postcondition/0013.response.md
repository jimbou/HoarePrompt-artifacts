Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `pk` is an integer equal to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is odd, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 1, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0, and `s[i]` is '1'**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `one` has been incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
