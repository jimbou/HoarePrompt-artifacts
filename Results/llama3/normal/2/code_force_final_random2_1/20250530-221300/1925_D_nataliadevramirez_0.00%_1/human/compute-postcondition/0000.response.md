Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, 0 <= `m` <= min(10^5, `n`*(`n`-1)/2), and 1 <= `k` <= 2*10^5. `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` such that 1 <= `a_i`, `b_i` <= `n` and 1 <= `f_i` <= 10^9. `t` is an integer. stdin contains one input: an integer.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` remain the same as in the initial state. A new variable `t` is introduced, which is assigned the value of an integer input from the user. The stdin now contains one input: an integer.
