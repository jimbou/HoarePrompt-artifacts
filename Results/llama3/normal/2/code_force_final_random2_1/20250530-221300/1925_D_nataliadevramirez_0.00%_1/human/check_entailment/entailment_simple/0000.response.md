Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The given program calculates this expected value by summing the products of friendship values and a quadratic expression of k, modulo MOD, where the sum is taken over all friendships in the list.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the formula for the expected value. The formula is derived by considering the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion and the increase in friendship value when a pair is chosen. The program correctly calculates this probability and the increase in friendship value, and sums them up to get the expected value.

The program also correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow and ensure that the result is within the required range.

However, the program does not correctly calculate the expected value. The expected value is not simply the sum of the products of friendship values and a quadratic expression of k. The correct formula for the expected value is more complex and involves the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion and the increase in friendship value when a pair is chosen.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
