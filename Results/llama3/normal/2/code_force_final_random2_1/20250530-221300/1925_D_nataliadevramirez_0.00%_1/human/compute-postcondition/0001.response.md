The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, 0 <= `m` <= min(10^5, `n`*(`n`-1)/2), and 1 <= `k` <= 2*10^5. `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` such that 1 <= `a_i`, `b_i` <= `n` and 1 <= `f_i` <= 10^9. `t` is an integer. stdin contains one input: an integer. does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
