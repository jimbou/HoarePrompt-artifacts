Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, friendships is a list of m lists, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9, t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is t-1, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), stdin is empty, and the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships) is being printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are within their specified ranges. The variable `_` has reached the value of `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `result` holds the output of the function `func_1` for the last iteration, and the output of `func_1` is being printed. The input from `stdin` has been fully consumed, and the loop has finished executing.
