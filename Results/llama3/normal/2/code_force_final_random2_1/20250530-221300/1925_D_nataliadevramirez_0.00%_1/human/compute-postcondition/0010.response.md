Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, friendships is a list of m lists, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9, t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 2, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), stdin is empty, and the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships) is being printed.**

The code block reads input from stdin and assigns the values to n, m, and k. Since stdin is empty, the input() function will not block, and the values of n, m, and k will be updated accordingly. The friendships list is populated with m lists, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. The result variable is assigned the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), which is being printed. The value of _ remains unchanged at 2. The output state reflects the updated values of n, m, k, friendships, and result, while maintaining the original values of t and _.
