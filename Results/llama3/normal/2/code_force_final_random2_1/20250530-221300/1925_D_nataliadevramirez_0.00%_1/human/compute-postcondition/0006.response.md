Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, friendships is a list of m lists, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9, t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), stdin is empty, and the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships) is being printed**

The code first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to n, m, and k. Since stdin is empty, these values are not changed. Then, it reads m lines from stdin, each containing three integers, and assigns them to friendships. Since stdin is empty, these values are not changed. Finally, it calls func_1 with the current values of n, m, k, and friendships, and assigns the result to result. Since the output of func_1 is being printed, the value of result is not changed.
