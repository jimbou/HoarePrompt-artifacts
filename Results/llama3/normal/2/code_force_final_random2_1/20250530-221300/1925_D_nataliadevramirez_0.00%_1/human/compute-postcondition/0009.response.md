To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is an iteration variable, and `t`, which is the upper limit of the range. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, friendships is a list of m lists, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9, t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 2, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), stdin is empty, and the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships) is being printed, and the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships) is being printed**
