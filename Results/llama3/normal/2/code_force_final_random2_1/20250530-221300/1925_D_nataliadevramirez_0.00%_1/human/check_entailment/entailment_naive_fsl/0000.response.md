Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not take into account the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.

In the problem description, it is mentioned that the teacher chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently for each excursion. This means that the probability of choosing a pair of friends is not constant and changes after each excursion.

The program, however, assumes that the probability of choosing a pair of friends is constant and calculates the expected value based on this assumption. This is incorrect and leads to an incorrect result.

For example, consider a case where there are 3 children and 2 pairs of friends with friendship values 1 and 2 respectively. The program would calculate the expected value as (1 + 2) * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD, which is incorrect.

A correct solution would involve calculating the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion and then calculating the expected value based on these probabilities.
