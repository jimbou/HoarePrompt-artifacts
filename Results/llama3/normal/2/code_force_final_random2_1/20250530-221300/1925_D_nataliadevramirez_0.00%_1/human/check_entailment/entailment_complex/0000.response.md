Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` calculates the sum of products of friendship values and a quadratic expression of k, modulo MOD, for all friendships in the input list. However, this function does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should be calculated by considering the probability of each pair being chosen and the increase in friendship value for each pair.

`func_2` is the main function that reads input data, calls `func_1` to calculate the result, and prints the result. However, since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the expected value, the overall program is incorrect.

Therefore, the correctness of the given Python program is **False**. 

Correctness: **False**
