The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^5, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, friendships is a list of m lists, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9, t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), stdin is empty, and the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships) is being printed**
