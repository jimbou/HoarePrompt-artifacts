Correctness: **False**

Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the function `func_1`, which calculates the sum of products of friendship values and a quadratic expression of k, modulo MOD, for all friendships in the input list. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen.

The correct approach would be to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion, taking into account the probability of each pair being chosen and the increase in their friendship value. This would require a more complex calculation, possibly involving the use of probabilities and expected values.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect, and the correctness is **False**.
