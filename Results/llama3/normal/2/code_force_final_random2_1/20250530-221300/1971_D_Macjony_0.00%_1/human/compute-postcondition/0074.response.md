The only variable in the loop head is variable j and s, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables j and s.  If j is less than len(s) - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 2, 3 or 4 and s is a string of length at least 3 consisting of characters '0' and '1` and is the last string read from `stdin`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the length of s needed to have been at least 4 and j currently must be less than len(s) - 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` strings, `s` is a string of length at least 4 consisting of characters '0' and '1` and is the last string read from `stdin`, j is either 2, 3 or 4 and j is less than len(s) - 1**
