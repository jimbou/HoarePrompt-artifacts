Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', s is a string of length at least 4 and at most 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1'. If the current value of s[j] is '1' and the current value of s[j + 1] is '0', then count is 3, flag is True, and j is 4 and j is less than len(s) - 1. Otherwise, count is 3, flag is True, and j is 3 and j is less than len(s) - 1, and the current value of s[j] is '1'.**

In this output state, the value of j has been incremented by 1. If the current value of s[j] is '1' and the current value of s[j + 1] is '0', then j is now 4, otherwise, j is now 3. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
