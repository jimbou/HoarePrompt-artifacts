Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string of length at least 3 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `j` is less than the length of string `s` minus 1 and is incremented by 1, If the current character at index `j` in string `s` is different from the character at index `j+1`, then if the current character at index `j` in string `s` is '0' and the character at index `j+1` is '1', flag is True, and the current character at index 1 in string `s` is '1'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 1 and 500, `i` is still 0, and the input strings in stdin remain unchanged. The string `s` still has a length of at least 3 and consists of characters '0' and '1'. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but still remains less than the length of string `s` minus 1. The condition regarding the characters at indices `j` and `j+1` in string `s` is still applicable, and if the characters are different, the flag is True, and the character at index 1 in string `s` is '1'. If the characters are the same, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
