Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string of length at least 5 and at most 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1'. If the current value of `s[j]` is '1' and the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '0', then `count` is 4, `flag` is True, and `j` is 4 and `j` is less than len(s) - 1. Otherwise, `count` is 4, `flag` is True, and `j` is 3 and `j` is less than len(s) - 1, and the current value of `s[j]` is '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a new value of 4. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `s`, `j`, and `flag` still hold. The stdin still contains t-3 strings s, and the length and character constraints on `s` are still valid.
