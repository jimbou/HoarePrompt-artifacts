Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-7` strings if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-6` strings, `s` is a string of length at least 4 consisting of characters '0' and '1` and is the last string read from `stdin`, `j` is either 4 or 5 if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `j` is either 3, 4 or 5, `j` is less than `len(s) - 1`, `count` is increased by 1 and `flag` is True if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'**.

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1. If `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, then `j` is now either 4 or 5, otherwise it is either 3, 4 or 5. The other variables remain unchanged.
