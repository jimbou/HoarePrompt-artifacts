State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` strings `s` (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `j` is equal to len(s) - 1, if there is at least one pair of adjacent characters in `s` where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1', then `count` is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in `s` that are different minus 1, otherwise `count` is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in `s` that are different, and the `count` is printed.**
