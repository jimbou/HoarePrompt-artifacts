Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` strings `s` (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
                j += 1
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', s is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', j is equal to the length of string s minus 1, and count is printed, count (where count is either the number of pairs of adjacent characters in string s that are different minus 1, or the number of pairs of adjacent characters in string s that are different, depending on whether there exists a pair of adjacent characters in string s where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1')

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output: *t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', s is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', j is equal to len(s) - 1, if there is at least one pair of adjacent characters in s where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1', then count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different minus 1, otherwise count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different, and the count is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', s is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1' and is the last string read from stdin, j is equal to len(s) - 1, count is the number of times '0' and '1' alternate in s plus 1, and if '0' and '1' alternate in s and the first character of s is '0', then the current value of flag is True, otherwise flag is False, and the count is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
