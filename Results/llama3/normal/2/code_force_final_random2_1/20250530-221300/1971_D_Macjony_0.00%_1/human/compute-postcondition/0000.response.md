The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) followed by `t` strings `s` (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The integer `t` is assigned to `t`. The remaining strings `s` are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` strings `s` (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.**
