Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `j` is equal to the length of string `s` minus 1, `count` is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in string `s` that are different minus 1, and `flag` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` has been decremented by 1, but all other variables remain unchanged. The number of pairs of adjacent characters in string `s` that are different has been reduced by 1, but the existence of a pair of adjacent characters in string `s` where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1' is still guaranteed, so `flag` remains True.
