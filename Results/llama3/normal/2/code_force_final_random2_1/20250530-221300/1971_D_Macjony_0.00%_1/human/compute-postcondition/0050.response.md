Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string of length at least 5 and at most 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `flag` is True, `count` is 4. If the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[j + 1]`, then `j` is 6 if the current value of `s[4]` is '1' and the current value of `s[5]` is '0', otherwise `j` is 5. Otherwise, `j` is 4 and `j` is less than len(s) - 1, and the current value of `s[j]` is '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[j + 1]`, then `j` is either 6 or 5, depending on the values of `s[4]` and `s[5]`. Otherwise, `j` is 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
