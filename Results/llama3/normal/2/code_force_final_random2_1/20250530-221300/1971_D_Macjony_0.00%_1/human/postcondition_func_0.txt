This function reads a series of binary strings from standard input, where the number of strings is specified by an integer at the beginning of the input. For each string, it counts the number of pairs of adjacent characters that are different, but if there is at least one pair where '0' is followed by '1', it decrements this count by 1. The function then prints the resulting count for each string.
