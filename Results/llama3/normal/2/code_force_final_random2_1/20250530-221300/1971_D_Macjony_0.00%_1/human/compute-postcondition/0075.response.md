Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` strings, `s` is a string of length at least 4 consisting of characters '0' and '1` and is the last string read from `stdin`, j is either 2, 3 or 4 and j is less than len(s) - 1, `count` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The input state of `stdin` is still the same, containing `t-6` strings. The string `s` is still the last string read from `stdin`, and its length is still at least 4, consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The value of `j` is still either 2, 3, or 4, and it is still less than `len(s) - 1`. The value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and the value of `i` is still 2.
