The variables in the loop head are new_median and median, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables new_median and median. If new_median is less than or equal to median, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, new_median is an integer equal to b[ma] and median is an integer. For the loop to execute one more time, new_median must be less than or equal to median. Since new_median is equal to b[ma], we need to adjust the state of b and ma to ensure that b[ma] is less than or equal to median. Since b is a sorted list of integers, we can adjust the state of ma to ensure that ma is an index of b such that b[ma] is less than or equal to median.

State: **num is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin is empty, op is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, ma is an integer such that b[ma] is less than or equal to median, median is an integer, new_median is an integer equal to b[ma]**
