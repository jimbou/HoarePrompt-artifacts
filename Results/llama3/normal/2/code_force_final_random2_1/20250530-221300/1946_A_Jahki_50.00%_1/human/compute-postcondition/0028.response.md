Output State: **num is greater than 1, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 0**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to num2. Since stdin is empty, this line will not affect the state of stdin. The second line assigns the string value of the input to case. Again, since stdin is empty, this line will not affect the state of stdin. The third line assigns the value 0 to op. This line does not affect any other variables.

The initial state of num is greater than 1, and this is not modified by the code. The initial state of i is 1, and this is also not modified by the code. The initial state of num2 is an integer, and this is modified by the first line of the code to be the integer value of the input. The initial state of case is a string, and this is modified by the second line of the code to be the string value of the input. The initial state of stdin is empty, and this is not modified by the code. The variable op is introduced in the third line and is assigned the value 0.
