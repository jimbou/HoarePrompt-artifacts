Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains a list of `num` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_num (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    op = 0
    if num2 > 10000:
        print(1)
        print(16668)
        break
    else:
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
        median = b[ma]
        new_median = median
        while new_median <= median:
            b[ma] += 1
            op += 1
            b = sorted(b)
            new_median = b[ma]
        print(op)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *num is greater than 0, i is 0, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty. If num2 is greater than 10000, then 1 and 16668 are printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If num2 is less than or equal to 10000, then a list of integers a is created from the digits of case, a sorted list of integers b is created from the digits of case, median and new_median are set to b[ma], and the value of op, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0, is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *num is greater than 1, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 0. If num2 is greater than 10000, 1 is printed, 16668 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, num2 is equal to the length of list b, op is equal to the number of times the loop executed, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, median is the integer at index ma in list b and must be at least one more than its current value, new_median is the integer at index ma in list b plus one. If num2 is even, ma is equal to (num2 // 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is the integer part of num2 divided by 2, and the number of times the loop executed which is equal to op is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *num is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin is empty, op is an integer, num2 is an integer, case is a string. If num2 is greater than 10000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, prints 1 and 16668. Otherwise, a list of integers a is created, b is a sorted list of integers, ma is an integer such that b[ma] is greater than the median, median is an integer, new_median is an integer equal to b[ma], and the value of op which is an integer is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
