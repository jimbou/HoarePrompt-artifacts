To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `new_median` and `median` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. At the end of the last iteration, `new_median` is an integer equal to `b[ma]`, and `median` is an integer equal to `b[ma] + 1`. Since `new_median` is already less than `median`, we don't need to adjust `median`. However, we need to ensure that `new_median` remains less than or equal to `median` for the loop to execute again.

To achieve this, we can adjust `new_median` to be less than `b[ma] + 1`, which is the current value of `median`. This ensures that the loop condition `new_median <= median` remains true.

State: **num is greater than 0, i is 0, num2 is an integer and is less than or equal to 10000, op is 2, a is a list of integers that are digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits from the string case, median is an integer equal to b[ma] + 1, new_median is an integer less than b[ma] + 1**
