Output State: **num is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin is empty, op is 0, num2 is an integer, case is a string, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line creates a list `a` by iterating over the characters in the string `case`, checking if each character is a digit using the `isdigit()` method, and converting the digit characters to integers using the `int()` function. The resulting list `a` contains the integer values of the digit characters in the string `case`.

The second line sorts the list `a` in ascending order using the `sorted()` function and assigns the sorted list to the variable `b`. The `sorted()` function returns a new sorted list and leaves the original list `a` unchanged.

Since the code only modifies the variables `a` and `b`, the other variables `num`, `i`, `stdin`, `op`, `num2`, and `case` remain unchanged. The final output state includes the updated values of `a` and `b`, as well as the unchanged values of the other variables.
