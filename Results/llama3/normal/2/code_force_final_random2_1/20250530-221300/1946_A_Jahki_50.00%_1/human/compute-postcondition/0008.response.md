Output State: **`num` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer greater than 10000, `case` is a string, `op` is 0, stdin is empty, 1 is being printed, and 16668 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, and `op` remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty. The print statements for 1 and 16668 are still being executed. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
