Postcondition: ***num is greater than 1, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 0. If num2 is greater than 10000, 1 is printed, 16668 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, num2 is equal to the length of list b, op is equal to the number of times the loop executed, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, median is the integer at index ma in list b and must be at least one more than its current value, new_median is the integer at index ma in list b plus one. If num2 is even, ma is equal to (num2 // 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is the integer part of num2 divided by 2, and the number of times the loop executed which is equal to op is being printed.***
