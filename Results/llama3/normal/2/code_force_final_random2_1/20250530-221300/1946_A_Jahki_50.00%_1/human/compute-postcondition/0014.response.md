The code `ma = int(num2 / 2)` assigns the value of `num2` divided by 2 to `ma`. Since `num2` is an odd number and less than or equal to 10000, the value of `ma` will be the integer part of the division of `num2` by 2. 

Output State: **`num` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an odd integer and is less than or equal to 10000, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that are digits from the string case, `b` is a sorted list of integers that are digits from the string case, `ma` is an integer and is equal to the integer part of `num2` divided by 2.**
