Output State: **num is greater than 0, i is 0, num2 is an integer and is less than or equal to 10000, op is 0, a is a list of integers that are digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits from the string case.**

In this output state, the values of `num`, `i`, `num2`, and `op` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The variable `case` is also unchanged, but its contents are used to create the list `a`, which contains the digits from the string `case`. The list `b` is a sorted version of `a`, containing the same digits in ascending order. Stdin remains empty as it was initially.
