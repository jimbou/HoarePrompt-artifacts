To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `new_median` and `median` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. At the end of the last iteration, `new_median` is the integer at index `ma` in list `b` plus one, and `median` is the integer at index `ma` in list `b`.

To guarantee the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `new_median` is still less than or equal to `median`. Since `new_median` is already one more than the integer at index `ma` in list `b`, we need to adjust `median` to be at least one more than its current value.

State: **`num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer greater than its current value and not equal to the length of list `b`, `case` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `op` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `median` is the integer at index `ma` in list `b` and must be at least one more than its current value, `new_median` is the integer at index `ma` in list `b` plus one**
