Output State: **num is greater than 1, i is 1, num2 is an integer equal to the length of list b, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is equal to the number of times the loop executed, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, median is the integer at index ma in list b and must be at least one more than its current value, new_median is the integer at index ma in list b plus one. If num2 is even, ma is equal to (num2 // 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is the integer part of num2 divided by 2.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed until `num2` is equal to the length of list `b`, and the median has increased by at least one. The number of times the loop executed is stored in `op`. The other variables remain unchanged.
