Output State: **num is greater than 1, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 0, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, median is the integer at index ma in list b, new_median is the integer at index ma in list b. If num2 is even, ma is equal to (num2 // 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is the integer part of num2 divided by 2.**

The code assigns the value of the integer at index `ma` in the sorted list `b` to `median` and then assigns the value of `median` to `new_median`. The value of `ma` depends on whether `num2` is even or odd, but its exact value is not specified. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
