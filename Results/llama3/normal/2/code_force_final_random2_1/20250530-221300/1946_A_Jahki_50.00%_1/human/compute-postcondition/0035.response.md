Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code assigns a value to the variable `ma`. The value is calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.

Since `num2` is an integer, the division `num2 / 2` will result in a floating-point number. The `int()` function will truncate this number to an integer, effectively rounding down to the nearest whole number.

Let's denote the value of `num2` as `n2`. Then, the value of `ma` can be expressed as:

`ma = int(n2 / 2) - 1`

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. A new variable `ma` is introduced, which is calculated as the integer part of half of `num2`, minus 1.
