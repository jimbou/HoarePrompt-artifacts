Output State: **`num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is 0, 1 is being printed, and 16668 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, and `op` remain unchanged. The code `break` only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is directly inside, without affecting the values of the variables. The printing of 1 and 16668 is also not affected by the `break` statement.
