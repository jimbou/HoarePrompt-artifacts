Postcondition: ***num is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin is empty, op is an integer, num2 is an integer, case is a string. If num2 is greater than 10000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, prints 1 and 16668. Otherwise, a list of integers a is created, b is a sorted list of integers, ma is an integer such that b[ma] is greater than the median, median is an integer, new_median is an integer equal to b[ma], and the value of op which is an integer is being printed.***
