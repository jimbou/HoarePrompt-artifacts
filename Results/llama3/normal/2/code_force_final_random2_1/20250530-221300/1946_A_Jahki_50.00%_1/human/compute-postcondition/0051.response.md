Output State: **num is greater than 2, i is 2, stdin is empty, op is 0, num2 is an integer, case is a string.**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to num2. Since stdin is empty, this line does not affect the state of stdin. The second line assigns the string value of the input to case. The third line assigns 0 to op. 

The value of num is not affected by the code block and remains greater than 2. The value of i is also not affected and remains 2. The value of stdin is not affected and remains empty. The value of op is updated to 0. The value of num2 is updated to an integer. The value of case is updated to a string.
