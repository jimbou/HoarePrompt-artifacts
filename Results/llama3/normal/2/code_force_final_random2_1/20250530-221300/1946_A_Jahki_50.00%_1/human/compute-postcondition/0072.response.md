Output State: **num is greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to num, stdin is empty, op is an integer, num2 is an integer, case is a string. If num2 is greater than 10000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, prints 1 and 16668. Otherwise, a list of integers a is created, b is a sorted list of integers, ma is an integer such that b[ma] is greater than the median, median is an integer, new_median is an integer equal to b[ma], and the value of op which is an integer is being printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the program has processed all the input test cases. The loop counter `i` is now equal to `num`, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The input buffer `stdin` is empty, as all input test cases have been processed. The variable `op` holds the total number of operations performed across all test cases. The variables `num2` and `case` hold the values of the last test case processed. If `num2` is greater than 10000, the program has printed 1 and 16668 and exited the loop. Otherwise, the program has processed the last test case, and the variables `a`, `b`, `ma`, `median`, and `new_median` hold the values computed during the last iteration of the loop.
