Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the way it calculates the median and the number of operations required to increase it. 

In the given code, the median is calculated as the middle element of the sorted array when the length of the array is odd, and as the average of the two middle elements when the length is even. However, this is not entirely accurate. The problem statement defines the median as the number at index ⌈k/2⌉ in the sorted array, where k is the length of the array. This means that when the length of the array is even, the median is the number at the index ⌈k/2⌉, not the average of the two middle elements.

Moreover, the code does not correctly calculate the number of operations required to increase the median. It simply increments the median until it is greater than the original median, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach is to increment the elements at and below the median index until the median is increased.

For example, consider the input [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The median of this array is 1. To increase the median, we need to increment at least three elements (the median index and the two elements below it) to 2. However, the given code will only increment the median index to 2, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all cases, and its correctness is **False**.
