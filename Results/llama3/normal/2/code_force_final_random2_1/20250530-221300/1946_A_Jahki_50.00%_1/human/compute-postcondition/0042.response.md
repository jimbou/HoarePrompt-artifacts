The variables in the loop head are new_median and median, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables new_median and median. If new_median is less than or equal to median, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, new_median is the integer at index ma in list b and median is the integer at index ma in list b. For the loop to be executed one more time, new_median must be less than or equal to median. Since new_median and median are both integers at index ma in list b, we can't adjust them directly. However, we can adjust the index ma. If num2 is even, ma is equal to (num2 // 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is the integer part of num2 divided by 2. So, we can adjust num2 to be greater than its current value, so that ma can be adjusted to a smaller index, which makes new_median less than or equal to median.

State: **num is greater than 1, i is 1, num2 is an integer greater than its current value and not equal to the length of list b, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 1, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, median is the integer at index ma in list b, new_median is the integer at index ma in list b. If num2 is even, ma is equal to (num2 // 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is the integer part of num2 divided by 2.**
