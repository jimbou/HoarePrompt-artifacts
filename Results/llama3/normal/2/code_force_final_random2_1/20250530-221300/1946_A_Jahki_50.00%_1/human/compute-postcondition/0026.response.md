Postcondition: ***num is greater than 0, i is 0, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty. If num2 is greater than 10000, then 1 and 16668 are printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If num2 is less than or equal to 10000, then a list of integers a is created from the digits of case, a sorted list of integers b is created from the digits of case, median and new_median are set to b[ma], and the value of op, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0, is printed.***
