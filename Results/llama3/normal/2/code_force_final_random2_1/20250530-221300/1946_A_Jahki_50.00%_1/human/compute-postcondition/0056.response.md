Output State: **`num` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `op` is 0, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, 1 is being printed, and 16668 is being printed**

In this output state, the values of the variables `num`, `i`, `op`, `num2`, and `case` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the `break` statement. The `break` statement only causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The printing of 1 and 16668 is still being executed as it was not affected by the break statement.
