Output State: **`num` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an even integer less than or equal to 10000, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that are digits from the string case, `b` is a sorted list of integers that are digits from the string case, `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2 - 1`**.

In this output state, the value of `ma` is calculated based on the value of `num2`, which is an even integer less than or equal to 10000. The other variables remain unchanged.
