The only variables in the loop head are new_median and median, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables new_median and median.  If new_median is less than or equal to median, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, new_median is less than or equal to median, So for the loop to be executed one more time new_median must be less than median.
State: **num is greater than 0, i is 0, num2 is an integer and is less than or equal to 10000, op is 1, a is a list of integers that are digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits from the string case, median is an integer equal to b[ma] + 1, new_median is an integer equal to b[ma] + 1, and new_median must be less than median**
