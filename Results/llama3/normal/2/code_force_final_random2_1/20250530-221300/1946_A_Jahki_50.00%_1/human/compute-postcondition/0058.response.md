Output State: **`num` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `op` is 0, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `ma` is an integer equal to `int(num2 / 2) - 1`**.

In this output state, the value of `ma` is calculated by dividing `num2` by 2, taking the integer part of the result, and then subtracting 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
