Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the list by at least 1. If the list size is greater than 10000, it prints 1 and 16668 and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of operations required. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.**
