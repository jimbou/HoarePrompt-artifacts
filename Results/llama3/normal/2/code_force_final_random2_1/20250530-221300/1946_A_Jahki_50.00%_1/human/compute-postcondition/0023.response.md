Output State: **num is greater than 0, i is 0, num2 is an integer and is less than or equal to 10000, op is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers that are digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits from the string case, median is an integer equal to b[ma], new_median is an integer equal to b[ma].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. The loop will continue to execute until new_median is greater than median. Since new_median is equal to b[ma] and median is also equal to b[ma], the loop will terminate after the third iteration. The values of num, i, num2, a, and b remain unchanged, while op is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
