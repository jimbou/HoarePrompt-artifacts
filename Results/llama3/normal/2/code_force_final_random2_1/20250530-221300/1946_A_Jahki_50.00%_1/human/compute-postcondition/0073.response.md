Functionality: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It calculates the number of operations required to increase the median of the list by at least 1, or prints a default value if the list size exceeds 10,000. The function iterates through each test case, processes the list, and outputs the result.
