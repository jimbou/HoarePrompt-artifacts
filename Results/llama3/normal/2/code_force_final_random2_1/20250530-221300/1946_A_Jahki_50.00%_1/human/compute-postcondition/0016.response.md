Output State: **num is greater than 0, i is 0, num2 is an integer and is less than or equal to 10000, op is 0, a is a list of integers that are digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits from the string case, median is an integer equal to b[ma], new_median is an integer equal to b[ma]. If num2 is even, ma is an integer equal to num2 / 2 - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is an integer and is equal to the integer part of num2 divided by 2.**

The code assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `median` and then assigns the value of `median` to `new_median`. The value of `ma` depends on whether `num2` is even or odd. If `num2` is even, `ma` is `num2 / 2 - 1`. If `num2` is odd, `ma` is the integer part of `num2` divided by 2. The value of `b[ma]` is then assigned to `median` and `new_median`. No other variables are affected.
