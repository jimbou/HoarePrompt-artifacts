The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num`. If `i` is less than `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `num` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `num` must be greater than 2.
State: **`num` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `op` is 1. If `num2` is greater than 10000, 1 is printed, 16668 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `num2` is equal to the length of list `b`, `op` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `median` is the integer at index `ma` in list `b` and must be at least one more than its current value, `new_median` is the integer at index `ma` in list `b` plus one. If `num2` is even, `ma` is equal to (`num2` // 2) - 1. If `num2` is odd, `ma` is the integer part of `num2` divided by 2, and the number of times the loop executed which is equal to `op` is being printed.**
