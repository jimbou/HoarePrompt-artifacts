Output State: **num is greater than 0, i is 0, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the initial values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces three new variables: `num2`, `case`, and `op`. `num2` is assigned an integer value from the input, `case` is assigned a string value from the input, and `op` is initialized to 0. After the code executes, stdin is empty because two inputs have been consumed.
