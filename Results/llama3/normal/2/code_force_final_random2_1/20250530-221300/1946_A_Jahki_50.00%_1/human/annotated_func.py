#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: num is greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to num, stdin is empty, op is an integer, num2 is an integer, case is a string. If num2 is greater than 10000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, prints 1 and 16668. Otherwise, a list of integers a is created, b is a sorted list of integers, ma is an integer such that b[ma] is greater than the median, median is an integer, new_median is an integer equal to b[ma], and the value of op which is an integer is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the list by at least 1. If the list size is greater than 10000, it prints 1 and 16668 and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of operations required. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.
