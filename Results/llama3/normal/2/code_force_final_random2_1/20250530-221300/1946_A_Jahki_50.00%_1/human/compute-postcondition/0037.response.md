Let's analyze the code and calculate the output state.

The code is: `ma = int(num2 / 2)`

This line of code assigns the value of `num2` divided by 2, rounded down to the nearest integer, to the variable `ma`.

Since `num2` is an integer, the division `num2 / 2` will result in a floating-point number. The `int()` function will then truncate this floating-point number to an integer, effectively rounding down to the nearest integer.

The initial state specifies that `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a sorted list of integers.

After executing the code, the value of `ma` is assigned the result of the division and rounding down. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`num` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `ma` is the integer part of `num2` divided by 2**
