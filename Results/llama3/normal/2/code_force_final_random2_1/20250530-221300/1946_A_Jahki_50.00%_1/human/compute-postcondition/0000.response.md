Output State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains a list of `num` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_num (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now only contains a list of `num` integers, as the first input (the integer `num`) has already been read. The values of the other variables are not affected.
