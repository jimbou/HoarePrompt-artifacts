Output State: **num is greater than 1, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, stdin is empty, op is 0, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line creates a list `a` by iterating over the characters in the string `case` and converting any digits to integers. The second line sorts the list `a` in ascending order and assigns it to the variable `b`. 

The initial state of the variables remains unchanged, except for the addition of the new variables `a` and `b`. The value of `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, and the value of `b` is a sorted version of this list. The stdin remains empty, and the values of `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, and `op` are not affected by the code.
