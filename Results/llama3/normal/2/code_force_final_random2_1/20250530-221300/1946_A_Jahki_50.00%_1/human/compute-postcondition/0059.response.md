The code `ma = int(num2 / 2)` assigns the value of `num2` divided by 2 to `ma`. Since `num2` is an integer, the division will result in a whole number. The value of `ma` is now equal to half of `num2`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`num` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `op` is 0, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `ma` is half of `num2`.**
