The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is larger than `k`, then `r` is the integer at index `i` in `a` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`, `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by the product of `(i + 1)` and `(a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is the second integer in `a`, and `i` is 0.**
