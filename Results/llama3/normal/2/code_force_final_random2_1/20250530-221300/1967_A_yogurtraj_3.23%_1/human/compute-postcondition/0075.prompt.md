Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= 10^12). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^12).
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ii is 0, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is either the last integer in a or a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is either 0 or k % (i + 1), y is either 0 or n - 1 - i, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. If k is not equal to 0, then k is a non-negative integer and this is printed: (r - 1) * n + 1 where r is a[n - 1] + k // n. If k is 0, then this is printed: (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y, where r is the last integer in a, rem is 0, and y is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ii is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers, i is n - 1, and either k is not 0 and the value of (r - 1) * n + 1 is printed, where r is the integer at index n - 1 in a plus k divided by n, or k is 0 and the value of ((integer at index i in a plus 0 divided by i + 1) - 1) * n + 1 + the remainder of 0 divided by i + 1 + n - 1 - i is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is greater than 0, i is n - 1, ii is 2, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty. If k is not equal to 0, then r is a[n - 1] + k // n, and ((a[n - 1] + k // n) - 1) * n + 1 is printed. Otherwise, if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i, and k is 0, and (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y is printed. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) <= k, then n is decremented by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), and r is a[i + 1], and (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
