Output: **ii is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the integer at index i in a plus k divided by i + 1, rem is the remainder of k divided by i + 1, y is n - 1 - i, i is n - 1, and k is 0, and this is printed: (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y which is equal to ((integer at index i in a plus 0 divided by i + 1) - 1) * n + 1 + the remainder of 0 divided by i + 1 + n - 1 - i**
