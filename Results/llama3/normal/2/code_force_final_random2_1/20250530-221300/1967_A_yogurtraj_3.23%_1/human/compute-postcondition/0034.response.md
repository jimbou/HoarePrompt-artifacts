Output State: **ii is 1, n is a positive integer and must be at least 3, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the integer at index i in a plus k divided by i + 1, rem is the remainder of k divided by i + 1, y is n - 1 - i, i is 0, and k is 0**

In this final state, the values of `ii`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from the initial state. The variables `r`, `rem`, `y`, `i`, and `k` are updated according to the provided code snippet. Specifically, `r` is set to the integer at index `i` in `a` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`, `rem` is set to the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`, `i` is set to 0, and `k` is set to 0.
