The value of `r` is assigned the value of `a[n - 1] + k // n`. The value of `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a` and `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`. The value of `n` is greater than 0, so `n - 1` is also greater than or equal to 0. The value of `i` is `n - 1`, so `i` is also greater than or equal to 0. The value of `ii` is 2. The value of `k` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, stdin is empty.**
