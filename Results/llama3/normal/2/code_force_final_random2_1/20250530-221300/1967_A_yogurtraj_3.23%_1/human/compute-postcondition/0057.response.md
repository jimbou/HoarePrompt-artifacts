Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` is empty. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is updated to its original value minus the product of `i + 1` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, `r` is set to the second smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is set to 0, and `y` is set to 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `r` is set to `a[i]` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`, `rem` is set to `k` modulo `i + 1`, and `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`.***
