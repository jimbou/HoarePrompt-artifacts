Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of distinct types of cards (n) and the number of coins (k).
3. It then reads the number of cards of each type and sorts them in ascending order.
4. The program calculates the value of r, which represents the maximum number of cards of each type that can be obtained using the available coins.
5. If there are remaining coins after calculating r, it calculates the remaining number of cards that can be obtained and adds it to the result.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum score that can be obtained, which is either (r - 1) * n + 1 or (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y, depending on the value of k.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when k is 0 or when there are no remaining coins after calculating r. The logic is sound, and the program should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
