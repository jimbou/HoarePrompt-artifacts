Output: **`ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is either 0 or `k % n`, `y` is either 0 or `n - 1 - i`, `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, and this is printed: `(r - 1) * n + 1` where `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`**
