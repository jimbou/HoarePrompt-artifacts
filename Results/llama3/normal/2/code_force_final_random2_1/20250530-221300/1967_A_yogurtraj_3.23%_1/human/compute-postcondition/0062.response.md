The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` is empty. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `n` is decremented by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
