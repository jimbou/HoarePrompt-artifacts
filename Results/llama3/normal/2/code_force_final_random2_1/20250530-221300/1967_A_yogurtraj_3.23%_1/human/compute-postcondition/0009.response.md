Output State: **ii is 0, n is a positive integer that must be at least 3, a is a sorted list of integers, r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i, i is 1, k is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this final state, the values of `ii`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `r` is updated to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, where `i` is 1 and `k` is 0. The value of `rem` is updated to `k % (i + 1)`, which is 0. The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`, where `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3 and `i` is 1. The value of `k` is set to 0. The state of stdin remains the same, containing multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.
