The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is either the second smallest integer in `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is either 0 or `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is either 0 or `n - 1 - i`, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0 and `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer, `r` is the integer at index `i + 1` in `a`, `rem` is either 0 or `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is either 0 or `n - 1 - i`.**
