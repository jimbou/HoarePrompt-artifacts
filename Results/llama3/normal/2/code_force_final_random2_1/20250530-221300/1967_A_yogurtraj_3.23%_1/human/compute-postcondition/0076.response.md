Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. It then processes each test case by sorting the integers, calculating a value r based on the sorted integers and k, and printing a result for each test case. The result is either (r - 1) * n + 1 or (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y, depending on the value of k. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and the variables n, a, and i in a final state of 0, empty list, and -1, respectively.**
