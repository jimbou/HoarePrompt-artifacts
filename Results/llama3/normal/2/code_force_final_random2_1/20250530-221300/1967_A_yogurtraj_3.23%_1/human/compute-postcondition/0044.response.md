To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

Initial State:
- `ii` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `k` is not 0
- `r` is the integer at index `n - 1` in `a` plus `k` divided by `n`
- `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`
- `y` is `n - 1 - i`

Given the initial state, we can deduce the following:

- Since `i` is `n - 1`, `y` which is `n - 1 - i` will always be 0 because `n - 1 - (n - 1) = 0`.
- The value of `r` depends on the value of `k` and the integer at index `n - 1` in list `a`. However, without knowing the exact values of `k` and the elements in `a`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `r`.
- The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` involves `r` and `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and we can't determine the exact value of `r` without more information, we can't compute the exact numerical result of this expression.

However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables and their relationships.

Output: **((the integer at index n - 1 in a plus k divided by n) - 1) * n + 1 (where n is a positive integer, k is not 0, and a is a sorted list of integers)**
