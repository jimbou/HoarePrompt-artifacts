The only variable in the loop head is variable ii, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable ii. If ii is less than the input value, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, ii is 1. For the loop to execute again, ii must be increased by 1.
State: **ii is 2, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers, i is n - 1, and either k is not 0 and the value of (r - 1) * n + 1 is printed, where r is the integer at index n - 1 in a plus k divided by n, or k is 0 and the value of ((integer at index i in a plus 0 divided by i + 1) - 1) * n + 1 + the remainder of 0 divided by i + 1 + n - 1 - i is printed.**
