Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is 2, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `i` is 0 and the current value of `a` is a sorted list of integers such that ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k)***
