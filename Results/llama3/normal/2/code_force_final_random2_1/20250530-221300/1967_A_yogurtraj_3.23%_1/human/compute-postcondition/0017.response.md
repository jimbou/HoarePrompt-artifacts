Postcondition: **ii is 0, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is either the last integer in a or a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is either 0 or k % (i + 1), y is either 0 or n - 1 - i, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of k is not 0, and it is a non-negative integer. Additionally, (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) is not greater than k.**
