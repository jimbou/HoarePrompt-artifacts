Postcondition: **ii is 0, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is either the last integer in a or a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is either 0 or k % (i + 1), y is either 0 or n - 1 - i, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. If k is not equal to 0, then k is a non-negative integer and this is printed: (r - 1) * n + 1 where r is a[n - 1] + k // n. If k is 0, then this is printed: (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y, where r is the last integer in a, rem is 0, and y is 0.**
