Output State: **ii is 0, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is either the last integer in a or a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is either 0 or k % (i + 1), y is either 0 or n - 1 - i, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) is greater than k, then k is 0. Otherwise, k is a non-negative integer.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The variable `ii` remains 0.
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer.
- The variable `a` remains a sorted list of integers.
- The variable `r` is either the last integer in the list `a` or the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, where `i` is the last index of the loop.
- The variable `rem` is either 0 or the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)`, where `i` is the last index of the loop.
- The variable `y` is either 0 or the difference between `n` and `i`, where `i` is the last index of the loop.
- The variable `i` is `n - 1`, which is the last index of the loop.
- The variable `k` is either 0 or a non-negative integer.
- The stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.
