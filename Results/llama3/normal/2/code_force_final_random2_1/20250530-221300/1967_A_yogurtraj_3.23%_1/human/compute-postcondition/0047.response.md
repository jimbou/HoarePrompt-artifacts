To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

Initial State:

- `ii` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `r` is the integer at index `i` in `a` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`
- `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`
- `y` is `n - 1 - i`
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `k` is 0

Given the initial state, we can deduce the following:

- Since `k` is 0, `r` simplifies to just the integer at index `i` in `a`, because adding 0 divided by any number (`i + 1`) does not change the value.
- `rem` is also 0, because the remainder of 0 divided by any number is 0.
- Since `i` is `n - 1`, `y` is `n - 1 - (n - 1)`, which simplifies to 0.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

Substituting the simplified values:

- `r` is the integer at index `i` in `a` (let's call this integer `x` for clarity)
- `rem` is 0
- `y` is 0

The expression becomes:

```python
print((x - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 0)
```

Which further simplifies to:

```python
print((x - 1) * n + 1)
```

Since `x` is the integer at index `i` in `a`, and `i` is `n - 1`, `x` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the calculation `(last element of a - 1) * n + 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.

Output: **((last element of a - 1) * n + 1) (where n is the length of the list a)**
