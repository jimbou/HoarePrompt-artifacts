Postcondition: **`ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `i` is such that the product of `i + 1` and the difference between the integers at indices `i + 1` and `i` in list `a` is greater than `k`.**
