Postcondition: ***ii is 1, n is a positive integer and must be at least 2, a is a sorted list of integers. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) is larger than k, then r is the integer at index i in a plus k divided by i + 1, rem is the remainder of k divided by i + 1, y is n - 1 - i, and i is 0, and k is 0. Otherwise, r is the second integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, i is 0, and k is reduced by the product of (i + 1) and (a[i + 1] - a[i]).***
