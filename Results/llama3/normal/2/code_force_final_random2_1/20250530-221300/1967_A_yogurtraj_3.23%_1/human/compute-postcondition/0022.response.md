Based on the initial state, let's analyze the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `r` is either the last integer in `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `a[i]` is the last integer in `a`. Also, `k` is 0, so `k // (i + 1)` is 0. Therefore, `r` is the last integer in `a`.
* `rem` is either 0 or `k % (i + 1)`. Since `k` is 0, `rem` is 0.
* `y` is either 0 or `n - 1 - i`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `y` is 0.

Now, let's substitute these values into the print statement:

`print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)`

Since `r` is the last integer in `a`, `r - 1` is the second-to-last integer in `a`. Multiplying this by `n` gives us a value that is `n` times the second-to-last integer in `a`. Adding 1 to this result gives us a value that is `n` times the second-to-last integer in `a`, plus 1. Since `rem` is 0, adding `rem` to this result doesn't change the value. Finally, adding `y` (which is 0) to this result also doesn't change the value.

Therefore, the print statement will output a value that is `n` times the second-to-last integer in `a`, plus 1.

Output: **n times the second-to-last integer in a, plus 1**
