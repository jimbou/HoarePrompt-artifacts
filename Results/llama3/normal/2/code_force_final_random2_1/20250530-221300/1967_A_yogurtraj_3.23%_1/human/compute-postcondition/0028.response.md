Postcondition: ***`ii` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the first integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `i` is such that the product of `i + 1` and the difference between the integer at index `i + 1` and the integer at index `i` in `a` is greater than `k`.***
