Postcondition: ***`ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is either the second smallest integer in `a` or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is either 0 or `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is either 0 or `n - 1 - i`, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is a positive integer and the product of `(i + 1)` and the difference between the elements at indices `i + 1` and `i` in list `a` is less than or equal to `k`.***
