Output State: **n is decremented by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), r is a[i + 1], i is 2, ii is 2, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been decreased by the product of `(i + 1)` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`. The value of `r` is now equal to `a[i + 1]`. The values of `i`, `ii`, `a`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
