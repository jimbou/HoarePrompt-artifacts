Postcondition: **n is greater than 0, i is n - 1, ii is 2, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty. If k is not equal to 0, then r is a[n - 1] + k // n, and ((a[n - 1] + k // n) - 1) * n + 1 is printed. Otherwise, if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i, and k is 0, and (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y is printed. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) <= k, then n is decremented by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), and r is a[i + 1], and (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y is printed.**
