Postcondition: ***`ii` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is larger than `k`, then `r` is the integer at index `i` in `a` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`, `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by the product of `(i + 1)` and `(a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is the second integer in `a`, and `i` is 0.***
