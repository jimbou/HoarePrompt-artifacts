Output State: **ii is 0, n is a positive integer that must be at least 2, k is 0, a is a sorted list of integers, r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `ii` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `n` is still a positive integer that must be at least 2. The value of `k` is now 0. The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers. The value of `r` has been updated to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, where `i` is still 0. The value of `rem` is now `k % (i + 1)`, which is also 0 since `k` is 0. The value of `y` is now `n - 1 - i`, which is `n - 1` since `i` is 0. The value of `i` remains 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.
