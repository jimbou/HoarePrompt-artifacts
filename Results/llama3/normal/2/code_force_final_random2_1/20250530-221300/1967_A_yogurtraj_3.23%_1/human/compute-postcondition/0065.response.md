Postcondition: ***n is greater than 3, i is 2, ii is 2, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i, and k is 0. Otherwise, n is decremented by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), and r is a[i + 1].***
