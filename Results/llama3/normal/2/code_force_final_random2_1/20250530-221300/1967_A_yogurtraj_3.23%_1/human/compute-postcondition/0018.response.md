Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is either 0 or `k % n`, `y` is either 0 or `n - 1 - i`, `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n`, which is a new value based on the current values of `a`, `n`, and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
