Postcondition: **ii is 0, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is either the last integer in a or a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is either 0 or k % (i + 1), y is either 0 or n - 1 - i, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. k is 0.**
