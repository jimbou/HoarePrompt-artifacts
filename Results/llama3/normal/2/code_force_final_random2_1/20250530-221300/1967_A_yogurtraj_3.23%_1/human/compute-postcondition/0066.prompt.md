Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ii is 2, i is n - 1, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `ii` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` is empty. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is updated to its original value minus the product of `i + 1` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, `r` is set to the second smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is set to 0, and `y` is set to 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `r` is set to `a[i]` plus `k` divided by `i + 1`, `rem` is set to `k` modulo `i + 1`, and `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 2, i is 1, ii is 2, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i, and k is 0. Otherwise, n is decremented by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), and r is a[i + 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 3, i is 2, ii is 2, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i, and k is 0. Otherwise, n is decremented by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), and r is a[i + 1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
