To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`). 

State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the first integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0**
