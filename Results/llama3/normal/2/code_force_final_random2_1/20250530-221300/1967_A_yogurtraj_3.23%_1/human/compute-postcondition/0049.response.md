Postcondition: **ii is 1, n is a positive integer, a is a sorted list of integers, i is n - 1, and either k is not 0 and the value of (r - 1) * n + 1 is printed, where r is the integer at index n - 1 in a plus k divided by n, or k is 0 and the value of ((integer at index i in a plus 0 divided by i + 1) - 1) * n + 1 + the remainder of 0 divided by i + 1 + n - 1 - i is printed.**
