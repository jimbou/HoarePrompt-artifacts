Postcondition: ***ii is 0, n is a positive integer that must be at least 3, a is a sorted list of integers, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) is greater than k, then k is 0, r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), and y is n - 1 - i. Otherwise, k is a non-negative integer, r is the integer at index i + 1 in a, rem is either 0 or k % (i + 1), and y is either 0 or n - 1 - i.***
