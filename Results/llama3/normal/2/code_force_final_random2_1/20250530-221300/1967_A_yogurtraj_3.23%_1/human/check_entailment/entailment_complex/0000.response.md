Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the values of n and k, and the list of integers a.

2. It sorts the list a in ascending order, which is necessary for the subsequent calculations.

3. The program then iterates through the sorted list a, calculating the value r. If the difference between the current element and the next element multiplied by the index plus one is greater than k, it calculates r based on k and the index, and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it subtracts the difference multiplied by the index plus one from k and updates r.

4. If k is not zero after the loop, it calculates r based on k and n, and prints the result (r - 1) * n + 1.

5. If k is zero, it prints the result (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y, where rem is the remainder of k divided by the index plus one, and y is the difference between n and the index.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the maximum score that can be obtained.

Correctness: **True**
