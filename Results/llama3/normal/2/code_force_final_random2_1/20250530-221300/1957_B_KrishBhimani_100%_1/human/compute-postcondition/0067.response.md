Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `i` is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is `k` - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, `temp` is 2 to the power of `i`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
