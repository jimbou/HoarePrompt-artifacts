Postcondition: **n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is an empty list. If temp * 2 is less than k, then i is either 1 or 2, and temp is either 2 or a value greater than its original value but less than k. Otherwise, i is either 0 or 1, temp is either 1 or a value greater than its original value but less than k/2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
