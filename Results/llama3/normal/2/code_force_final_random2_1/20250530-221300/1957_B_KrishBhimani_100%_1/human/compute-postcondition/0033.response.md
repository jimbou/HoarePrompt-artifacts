Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 1, ans is an empty list, and the current value of temp is twice its original value, which is less than k.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been doubled, and `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `temp` is still less than `k`, as the doubling of `temp` does not exceed the value of `k`.
