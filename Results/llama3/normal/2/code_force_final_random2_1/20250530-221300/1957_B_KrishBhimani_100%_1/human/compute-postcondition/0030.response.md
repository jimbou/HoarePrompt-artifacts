Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 0, ans is an empty list, temp is 1**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing `t - 3` lines of input. The code introduces new variables: `arr` is initialized as an empty list, `k0` is assigned the value of `k`, `i` is set to 0, `ans` is initialized as an empty list, and `temp` is set to 1.
