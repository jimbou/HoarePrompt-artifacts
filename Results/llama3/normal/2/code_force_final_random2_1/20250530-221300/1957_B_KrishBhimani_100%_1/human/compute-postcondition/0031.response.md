Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the values of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 0, ans is an empty list, temp is 1**
