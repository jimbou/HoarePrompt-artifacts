Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1, and the product of `temp` and 2 is larger than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains t - 3 lines of input, and all other variables retain their initial values.
