The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list.

The `ans` list contains three elements: the first element is `(1 << i) - 1`, the second element is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, and the remaining elements are zeros.

Since `i` is the number of times `temp` can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to `k`, we can infer that `i` is the smallest integer such that `2^i >= k`.

The first element of `ans` is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is equivalent to `2^i - 1`. This is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

The second element of `ans` is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, which is equivalent to `k - (2^i - 1)`. This is the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

The remaining elements of `ans` are zeros.

Therefore, the output will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`, followed by the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`, followed by zeros.

Output: **(2^i - 1), (k - (2^i - 1)), 0, 0, ...**
