Output State: **n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is an empty list, i is either 1 or 2, temp is either 2 or a value greater than its original value but less than k**

The code block modifies the values of `temp` and `i`. The first line doubles the value of `temp`, which was either 1 or a value greater than its original value but less than `k/2`. After doubling, `temp` becomes either 2 or a value greater than its original value but less than `k`. The second line increments the value of `i` by 1, making it either 1 or 2. No other variables are affected by the code block.
