The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. The list `ans` has a length of `n` and its elements are determined by the values of `i` and `k`. The first element of `ans` is `(1 << i) - 1`, the second element is `k - sum(ans)`, and the remaining elements are `0`. The value of `i` is the floor of `log2(k)`, and `temp` is either equal to `k` or the largest power of `2` less than `k`.

Output: **n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is a list of length n with the first element being (1 << i) - 1, the second element being k - sum(ans), and the remaining elements being 0, i is the floor of log2(k), and temp is either equal to k or the largest power of 2 less than k, and the elements of ans are printed**
