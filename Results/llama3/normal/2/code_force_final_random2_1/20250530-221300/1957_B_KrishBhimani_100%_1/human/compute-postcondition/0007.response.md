Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 0, ans is an empty list, temp is 1**
