Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input**

The code first reads a line of input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to `l1`. Then, it maps the first two elements of `l1` to integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. This means that the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integer values read from the input. The rest of the input lines in stdin remain unchanged.
