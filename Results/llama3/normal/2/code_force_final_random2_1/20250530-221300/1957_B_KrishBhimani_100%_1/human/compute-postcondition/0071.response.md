The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. The list `ans` contains `n` elements. The first element is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is the result of shifting the binary representation of 1 to the left by `i` places and then subtracting 1. This is equivalent to calculating 2 to the power of `i` and then subtracting 1.

The second element is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, which is the result of subtracting the first element from `k`. The remaining elements are zeros.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the list `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated elements of the list `ans`.

Output: **[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1), 0, 0, ..., 0] (where i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, k is the value of k, and the remaining elements are zeros)**
