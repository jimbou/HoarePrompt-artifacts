Output State: **n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 0, ans is an empty list, temp is 1, and temp * 2 is larger than or equal to k, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables n, k, stdin, arr, k0, i, ans, temp, and the relationship between temp and k remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
