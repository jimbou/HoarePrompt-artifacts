Output State: **n is at least 1, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input.**

The first line of the code reads a line from stdin and splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters. The second line converts the first two elements of this list into integers and assigns them to the variables n and k, respectively. 

Since the initial state specifies that the first line of stdin contains a single integer t, and each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k, after executing the code, stdin will contain t - 1 lines of input. 

The values of n and k are at least 1, as specified in the initial state.
