Output: **n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, ans is a list containing n elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is k - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, temp is 2 to the power of i, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, and this is printed: (1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1), and n-2 zeros**
