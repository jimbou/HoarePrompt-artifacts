Output State: **stdin is empty, t is an integer, for every n and k, if n is 1, the value of k is printed, otherwise, this is printed: (1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1), and n-2 zeros, where i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the standard input (stdin) is empty, and the value of t is an integer. For each pair of n and k, if n is 1, the value of k is printed. If n is not 1, the output is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is k - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, where i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k.
