Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, ans is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is k - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, temp is 2 to the power of i.**

The code appends three elements to the list `ans`. The first element is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is calculated using the value of `i`. The second element is `k - sum(ans)`, which is calculated using the value of `k` and the sum of the elements in `ans` up to that point. The third line appends zeros to `ans` until its length is equal to `n`. The values of `n`, `k`, `stdin`, `arr`, `k0`, `i`, and `temp` remain unchanged.
