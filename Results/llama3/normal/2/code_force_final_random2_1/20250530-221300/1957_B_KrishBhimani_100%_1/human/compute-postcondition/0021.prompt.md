Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 0, ans is an empty list, temp is 1
Code of the loop:
while True:
    if temp * 2 < k:
        temp *= 2
        i += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is an empty list. If temp * 2 is less than k, then i is 1 and temp is updated to a value greater than its original value but less than k/2. Otherwise, i remains 0, temp remains 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is an empty list. If temp * 2 is less than k, then i is either 1 or 2, and temp is either 2 or a value greater than its original value but less than k. Otherwise, i is either 0 or 1, temp is either 1 or a value greater than its original value but less than k/2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is an empty list. If temp * 2 is less than k, then temp is either 4 or a value greater than its original value but less than k, and i is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and either i is 0 or 1, and temp is either 1 or a value greater than its original value but less than k/2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
