Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, ans is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is k - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, temp is 2 to the power of i, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 1, ans is an empty list, temp is 2. The current value of temp is less than half of k.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `i` and `temp`. The first line doubles the value of `temp`, and the second line increments `i` by 1. Since `i` was initially 0, it becomes 1 after the second line. The value of `temp` is doubled from 1 to 2. The remaining variables and stdin remain unchanged.
