Output State: **n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 0, ans is an empty list, temp is 1**

In this output state, the values of n and k remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The stdin still contains t - 1 lines of input as no input operations are performed. The code initializes several new variables: arr and ans are empty lists, k0 is assigned the value of k, i is set to 0, and temp is set to 1.
