Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k, and then prints a sequence of numbers based on the values of n and k. If n is 1, it simply prints the value of k. Otherwise, it calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to k, subtracts this value from k, and prints the result along with n-2 zeros. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point stdin is empty.**
