Output State: **n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is an empty list, i is either 0 or 1, temp is either 1 or a value greater than its original value but less than k/2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The values of n, k, stdin, arr, k0, ans, i, and temp remain the same as in the initial state.
