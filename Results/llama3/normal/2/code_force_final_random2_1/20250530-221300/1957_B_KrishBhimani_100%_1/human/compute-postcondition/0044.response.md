Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is an empty list. If the initial value of temp is less than half of k, then i is 1 and the value of temp is twice its original value. Otherwise, the product of temp and 2 is larger than or equal to k, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
