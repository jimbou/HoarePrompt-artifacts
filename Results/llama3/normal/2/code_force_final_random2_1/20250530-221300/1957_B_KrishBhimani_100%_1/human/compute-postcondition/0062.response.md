Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, ans is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is k - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, temp is 2 to the power of i, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line multiplies the current value of `temp` by 2, effectively doubling it. The second line increments the value of `i` by 1. 

Since the initial value of `temp` is 2 to the power of `i`, doubling it will result in 2 to the power of `i+1`. Therefore, the new value of `temp` is 2 to the power of `i+1`. 

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is the original value of `i` plus 1. 

The remaining variables are not affected by the code snippet. The value of `n` remains an integer, `k` remains an integer, stdin still contains t - 3 lines of input, `arr` remains an empty list, `k0` remains equal to `k`, and `ans` remains a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is k - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros.
