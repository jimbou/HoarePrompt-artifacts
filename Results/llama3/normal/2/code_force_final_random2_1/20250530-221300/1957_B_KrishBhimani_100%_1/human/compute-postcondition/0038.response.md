Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is an empty list, temp is twice its original value, i is 1 plus its original value.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `temp` and `i`. The first line doubles the value of `temp`, and the second line increments `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
