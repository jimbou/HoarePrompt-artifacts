Output State: **n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is an empty list, temp is either 4 or a value greater than its original value but less than k, i is either 2 or 3.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line multiplies the value of `temp` by 2, and the second line increments the value of `i` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `temp` is either 2 or a value greater than its original value but less than `k`, and `i` is either 1 or 2. After the first line, `temp` becomes either 4 or a value greater than its original value but less than `k`. 

After the second line, `i` becomes either 2 or 3. 

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `stdin`, `arr`, `k0`, and `ans`) are not affected by the code snippet, so their values remain the same.
