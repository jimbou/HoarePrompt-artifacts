Output State: **n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 1, ans is an empty list, and the current value of temp is such that (temp * 2) is less than k but greater than its original value**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line multiplies the value of `temp` by 2, effectively doubling its value. Since the initial value of `temp` was such that `(temp * 2)` was less than `k`, the new value of `temp` is still less than `k` but greater than its original value. The second line increments the value of `i` by 1, changing it from 0 to 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
