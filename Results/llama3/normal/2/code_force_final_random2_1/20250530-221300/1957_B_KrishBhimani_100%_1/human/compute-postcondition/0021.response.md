Output State: **n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is an empty list, i is the floor of log2(k), and temp is either equal to k or the largest power of 2 less than k.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables not affected by the loop (n, k, stdin, arr, k0, ans) remain unchanged. The variable i is now equal to the floor of the base-2 logarithm of k, which represents the number of times the loop executed. The variable temp is either equal to k or the largest power of 2 less than k, depending on whether k is a power of 2 or not.
