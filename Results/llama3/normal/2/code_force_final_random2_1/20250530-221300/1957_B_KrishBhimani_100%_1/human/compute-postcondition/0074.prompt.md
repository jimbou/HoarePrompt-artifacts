Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    if n == 1:
        print(k)
    else:
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        ans = []
        temp = 1
        while True:
            if temp * 2 < k:
                temp *= 2
                i += 1
            else:
                break
        ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
        ans.append(k - sum(ans))
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is at least 1, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input. If n is exactly 1, the value of k which is at least 1 is being printed. If n is at least 2, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is a list of length n with the first element being (1 << i) - 1, the second element being k - sum(ans), and the remaining elements being 0, i is the floor of log2(k), and temp is either equal to k or the largest power of 2 less than k, and the elements of ans are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input. If n is equal to 1, the value of k is printed. Otherwise, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, ans is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is k - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, temp is 2 to the power of i, and this is printed: [(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1), 0]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, ans is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is k - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, temp is 2 to the power of i. If n is 1, the value of k which is equal to k0 is being printed. If n is not 1, then this is printed: (1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1), and n-2 zeros




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
