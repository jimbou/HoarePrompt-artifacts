Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, ans is an empty list, temp is 2 to the power of i.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables i and temp. The value of i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k. The value of temp is 2 to the power of i.
