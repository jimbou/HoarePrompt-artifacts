Output State: **n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If temp * 2 is less than k, then i is either 1 or 2, and temp is either 2 or a value greater than its original value but less than k. Otherwise, i is either 0 or 1, temp is either 1 or a value greater than its original value but less than k/2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of n, k, stdin, arr, k0, and ans remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions for i and temp are still dependent on the value of temp * 2 being less than k. If true, i can be 1 or 2, and temp can be 2 or a value greater than its original value but less than k. If false, i can be 0 or 1, and temp can be 1 or a value greater than its original value but less than k/2.
