Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is an empty list. If temp * 2 is less than k, then temp is either 4 or a value greater than its original value but less than k, and i is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and either i is 0 or 1, and temp is either 1 or a value greater than its original value but less than k/2.***
