The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and the return value of `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `int(input())`. If the return value of `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the return value of `int(input())` must be at least 1 and `_` is 0.
