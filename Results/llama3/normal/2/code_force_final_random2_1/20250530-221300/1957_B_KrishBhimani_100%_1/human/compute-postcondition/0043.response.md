Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list. If the initial value of `temp` is less than half of `k`, then `i` is 1 and the value of `temp` is twice its original value. Otherwise, the product of `temp` and 2 is larger than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet only contains a `break` statement, which does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
