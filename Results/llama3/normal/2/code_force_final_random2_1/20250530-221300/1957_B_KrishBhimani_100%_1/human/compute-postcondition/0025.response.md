Postcondition: ***n is at least 1, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input. If n is exactly 1, the value of k which is at least 1 is being printed. If n is at least 2, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is a list of length n with the first element being (1 << i) - 1, the second element being k - sum(ans), and the remaining elements being 0, i is the floor of log2(k), and temp is either equal to k or the largest power of 2 less than k, and the elements of ans are printed.***
