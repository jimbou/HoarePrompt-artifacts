Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **n is at least 2, k is at least 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, ans is an empty list, i is either 0 or 1, temp is either 1 or a value greater than its original value but less than k/2**
