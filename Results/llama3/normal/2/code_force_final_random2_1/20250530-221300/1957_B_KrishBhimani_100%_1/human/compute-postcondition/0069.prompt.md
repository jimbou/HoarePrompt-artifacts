Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, ans is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is k - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, temp is 2 to the power of i, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is 0, ans is an empty list, temp is 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    if temp * 2 < k:
        temp *= 2
        i += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `i` is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is `k` - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, `temp` is 2 to the power of `i`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`. If the current value of `temp` is less than half of `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 2. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `i` is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is `k` - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, `temp` is 2 to the power of `i`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`. If the current value of `temp` is less than half of `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 2. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`. If the current value of `temp` is less than half of `k`, then `i` is the number of times `temp` can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to `k` plus 1, `ans` is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << (i - 1)) - 1, the second element is `k` - ((1 << (i - 1)) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, `temp` is 2 to the power of (i - 1) times 2. Otherwise, `i` is the number of times `temp` can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is `k` - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, `temp` is 2 to the power of `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
