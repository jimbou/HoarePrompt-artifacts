Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `i` is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is `k` - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, `temp` is 2 to the power of `i`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of `i` is now the number of times `temp` can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to `k`, and the value of `temp` is now 2 to the power of `i`. The value of `ans` is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is `k` - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros. The other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged.
