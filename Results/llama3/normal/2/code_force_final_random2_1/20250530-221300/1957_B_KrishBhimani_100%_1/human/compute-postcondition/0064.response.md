Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `i` is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing three elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is `k` - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, `temp` is 2 to the power of `i`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`. If the current value of `temp` is less than half of `k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is 2. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
