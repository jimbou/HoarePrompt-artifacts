Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k, i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to k, ans is a list containing n elements: the first element is (1 << i) - 1, the second element is k - ((1 << i) - 1), and the remaining elements are zeros, temp is 2 to the power of i, arr is an empty list, k0 is equal to k.**

The code snippet appends two elements to the list `ans`: `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`. The first element is calculated using the value of `i`, which is the number of times `temp` can be doubled before it is greater than or equal to `k`. The second element is calculated by subtracting the sum of all elements in `ans` from `k`. The list `ans` is then extended with zeros to a length of `n`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, and `temp` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `arr` also remains unchanged, as it is not used or modified in the code. The value of `stdin` is not affected, as no input operations are performed.
