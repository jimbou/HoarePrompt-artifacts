Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, stdin contains t - 3 lines of input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the initial value of `temp` is less than half of `k`, then `i` is 1 and the value of `temp` is twice its original value. Otherwise, the product of `temp` and 2 is larger than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t - 3 lines of input. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions related to `temp` and `i` also remain the same, with `i` being 1 and `temp` being twice its original value if `temp` is less than half of `k`, or the product of `temp` and 2 being larger than or equal to `k` otherwise.
