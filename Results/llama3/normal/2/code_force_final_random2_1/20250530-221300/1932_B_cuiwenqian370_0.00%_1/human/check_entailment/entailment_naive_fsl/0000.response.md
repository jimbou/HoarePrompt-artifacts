Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to find the year in which all n signs will occur, but the program does not correctly calculate this year.

The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly handle the case when the signs occur sequentially. The program only checks if the current sign occurs after the previous sign, but it does not check if the current sign occurs at the correct year.

For example, if the input is [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18], the program will output 36, but the correct output should be 18. This is because the sixth sign occurs at year 18, not year 36.

The correct program should calculate the year in which each sign occurs and then find the maximum year among all signs. The program should also handle the case when the signs occur at the same year.

Here is a correct implementation of the program:
```
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        signs = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        year = 0
        for sign in signs:
            year = (year // sign + 1) * sign
        results.append(year)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```
This program correctly calculates the year in which all n signs will occur by iterating over the signs and updating the year accordingly.
