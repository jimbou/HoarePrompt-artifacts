Functionality: **This function calculates the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in a given path without encountering a '*' character. It accepts a list of characters as input, where each character is either '@' or '*', and returns an integer representing the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updating a dynamic programming table to keep track of the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached at each position. The function finally returns the maximum value in the dynamic programming table that is greater than negative infinity, which represents the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in the path without encountering a '*' character.**
