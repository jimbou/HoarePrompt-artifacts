Postcondition: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 2, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '@', -float('inf') + 1 if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1]` is 2 if the first character of `path` is '@' and the second character of `path` is '@'. The rest of the values in `dp` are 0, `i` is 2. The current value of `path[i]` is '*'**
