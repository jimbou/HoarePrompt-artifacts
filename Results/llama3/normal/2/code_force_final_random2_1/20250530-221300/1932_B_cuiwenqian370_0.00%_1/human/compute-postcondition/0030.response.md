Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 4, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '@', -float('inf') + 1 if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1]` is 2 if the first character of `path` is '@' and the second character of `path` is '@'. The rest of the values in `dp` are 0, except for `dp[2]` which is either -float('inf') if the current value of `path[i]` is '*', or `max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1` if the current value of `path[i]` is '@', `i` is 4. If `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[3]` is -float('inf'), otherwise `dp[3]` is `max(dp[2], dp[1]) + 1` if `path[3]` is '@'. `dp[4]` is -float('inf').**

In this output state, the value of `dp[4]` has been updated to -float('inf') as per the given code. The rest of the values in `dp` and the values of `path` and `n` remain the same as in the initial state.
