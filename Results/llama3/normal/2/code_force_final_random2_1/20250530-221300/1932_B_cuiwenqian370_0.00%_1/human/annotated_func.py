#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in a given path without encountering a '*' character. It accepts a list of characters as input, where each character is either '@' or '*', and returns an integer representing the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updating a dynamic programming table to keep track of the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached at each position. The function finally returns the maximum value in the dynamic programming table that is greater than negative infinity, which represents the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in the path without encountering a '*' character.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and strings of space-separated positive integers, where n is the number of integers in the following string. The function then applies the func_1 function to each string of space-separated positive integers and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result from the list. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to process and print the results based on the input provided.
