Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and strings of space-separated positive integers, where n is the number of integers in the following string, t is a positive integer equal to the first element of data, index is 2t+1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(path) where path is the string of space-separated positive integers at data[2i-1] for i from 1 to t, stdin is empty**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the state of the program is as follows:

* The `data` list remains the same, with the first element being a positive integer `t` and the rest of the elements being alternating positive integers `n` and strings of space-separated positive integers, where `n` is the number of integers in the following string.
* The `t` variable is still equal to the first element of `data`.
* The `index` variable has been incremented `2t+1` times, where `t` is the number of iterations.
* The `results` list contains the results of calling `func_1` on each string of space-separated positive integers in `data`, starting from the second element (index 1) and incrementing by 2 each time.
* The `stdin` remains empty.

Note that the only changes are in the values of `index` and `results`, which are updated according to the loop's execution. The other variables remain unchanged.
