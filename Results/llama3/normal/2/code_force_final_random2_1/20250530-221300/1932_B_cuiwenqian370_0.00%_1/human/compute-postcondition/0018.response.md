Functionality: **The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and strings of space-separated positive integers, where n is the number of integers in the following string. The function then applies the func_1 function to each string of space-separated positive integers and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result from the list. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to process and print the results based on the input provided.**
