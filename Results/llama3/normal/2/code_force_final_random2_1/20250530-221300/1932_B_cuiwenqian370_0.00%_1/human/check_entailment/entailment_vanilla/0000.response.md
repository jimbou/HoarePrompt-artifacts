Reasoning:

The provided Python program is not a solution to the given problem. The program appears to be a solution to a different problem, possibly related to pathfinding or dynamic programming.

The problem statement describes a scenario where the apocalypse will occur when n signs occur sequentially, with each sign occurring at a specific periodicity. The program is supposed to output the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

However, the provided program does not seem to address this problem at all. It defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but neither of them appears to be related to the problem statement. `func_1` seems to be a dynamic programming solution to a different problem, and `func_2` is a main function that reads input from stdin and calls `func_1` with a string argument.

The program does not take into account the periodicities of the signs, nor does it calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur. Therefore, it is not a correct solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
