To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so we don't need to worry about its state.

The given state is:

* `data` is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer `t`, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers `n` and strings of space-separated positive integers.
* `t` is a positive integer greater than 1.
* `index` is 5.
* `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)` where `path` is the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[1]` and the result of `func_1(path)` where `path` is the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[3]`.
* `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of integers in the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[3]`.
* `stdin` is empty.

Since the loop head only involves the variable `t`, we only need to adjust the state of `t` to determine if the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1. Since `t` is not changed by the loop body, its value remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer `t`, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers `n` and strings of space-separated positive integers, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)` where `path` is the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[1]` and the result of `func_1(path)` where `path` is the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[3]`, `n` is a positive integer equal to the number of integers in the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[3]`, `stdin` is empty**
