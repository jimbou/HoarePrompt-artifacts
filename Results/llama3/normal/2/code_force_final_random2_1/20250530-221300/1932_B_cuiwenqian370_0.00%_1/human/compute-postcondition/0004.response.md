Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and strings of space-separated positive integers, where n is the number of integers in the following string, t is a positive integer greater than 1, index is 5, results is a list containing the result of func_1(path) where path is the string of space-separated positive integers at data[1] and the result of func_1(path) where path is the string of space-separated positive integers at data[3], n is a positive integer equal to the number of integers in the string of space-separated positive integers at data[3], stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `index` has been incremented by 2, and the value of `n` has been updated to be the number of integers in the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[3]`. The `results` list has been appended with the result of `func_1(path)` where `path` is the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[3]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
