Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and strings of space-separated positive integers, where n is the number of integers in the following string, t is a positive integer equal to the first element of data, index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    path = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(path))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and strings of space-separated positive integers, where n is the number of integers in the following string, t is a positive integer greater than 0, index is 3, results is a list containing the result of func_1(path) where path is the string of space-separated positive integers at data[1], stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and strings of space-separated positive integers, where n is the number of integers in the following string, t is a positive integer greater than 1, index is 5, results is a list containing the result of func_1(path) where path is the string of space-separated positive integers at data[1] and the result of func_1(path) where path is the string of space-separated positive integers at data[3], n is a positive integer equal to the number of integers in the string of space-separated positive integers at data[3], stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and strings of space-separated positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than 1, index is 7, results is a list containing the result of func_1(path) where path is the string of space-separated positive integers at data[1], the result of func_1(path) where path is the string of space-separated positive integers at data[3], and the result of func_1(path) where path is the string of space-separated positive integers at data[5], n is a positive integer equal to the number of integers in the string of space-separated positive integers at data[5], stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
