Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '@', -float('inf') + 1 if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1]` is 2 if the first character of `path` is '@' and the second character of `path` is '@'. The rest of the values in `dp` are 0, except for `dp[2]` which is either -float('inf') if the current value of `path[i]` is '*', or `max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1` if the current value of `path[i]` is '@', `dp[3]` is either -float('inf') if the current value of `path[3]` is '*', or `max(dp[2], dp[1]) + 1` if the current value of `path[3]` is '@', `i` is 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `path` remains the same, and `n` is still at least 3. The list `dp` has been updated at index 3. If the character at index 3 in `path` is '*', then the value at index 3 in `dp` is -float('inf'). If the character at index 3 in `path` is '@', then the value at index 3 in `dp` is the maximum of the values at indices 1 and 2 in `dp`, plus 1. The rest of the values in `dp` remain the same. The value of `i` is now 3.
