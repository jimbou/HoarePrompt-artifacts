Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 2, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '@', -float('inf') + 1 if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1]` is 2 if the first character of `path` is '@' and the second character of `path` is '@'. The rest of the values in `dp` are 0 except for `dp[2]` which is -float('inf') because the current value of `path[i]` is '*', `i` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of characters `path` remains the same, the value of `n` is still at least 2, and the list `dp` has been updated such that its third element (`dp[2]`) is now -float('inf') because the current character in `path` at index `i` is '*', while the other elements of `dp` remain the same as before. The value of `i` is still 2.
