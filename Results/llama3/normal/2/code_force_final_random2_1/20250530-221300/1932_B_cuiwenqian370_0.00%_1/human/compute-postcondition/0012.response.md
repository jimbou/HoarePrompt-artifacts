The `print(result)` statement will print the second element of the `results` list. 

The `results` list contains the results of `func_1(path)` where `path` is the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[2i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `t`. 

Since `t` is a positive integer equal to the first element of `data` and must be at least 1, and `data` is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer `t`, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers `n` and strings of space-separated positive integers, where `n` is the number of integers in the following string, the `results` list will contain at least one element.

The `result` is the second element of `results`. Since the exact `data` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of `func_1(path)` for the second string of space-separated positive integers in the `data` list.

Output: **result (where result is the second element of the results list, which is the result of func_1(path) for the second string of space-separated positive integers in the data list)**
