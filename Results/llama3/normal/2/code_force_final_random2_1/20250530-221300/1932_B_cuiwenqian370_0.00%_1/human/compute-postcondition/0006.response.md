Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and strings of space-separated positive integers, t is a positive integer greater than 1, index is 7, results is a list containing the result of func_1(path) where path is the string of space-separated positive integers at data[1], the result of func_1(path) where path is the string of space-separated positive integers at data[3], and the result of func_1(path) where path is the string of space-separated positive integers at data[5], n is a positive integer equal to the number of integers in the string of space-separated positive integers at data[5], stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `index` has been incremented twice, resulting in a new value of 7. The value of `n` has been updated to the number of integers in the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[5]`. The `results` list has been appended with the result of `func_1(path)` where `path` is the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[5]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
