Reasoning: 
The given program does not solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided program appears to be solving a different problem, possibly related to finding the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in a path without encountering a '*' character.

The program provided does not take into account the periodicities of the signs, nor does it calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur. Instead, it seems to be focused on processing a list of characters and calculating some sort of maximum value.

Therefore, the program is not correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
