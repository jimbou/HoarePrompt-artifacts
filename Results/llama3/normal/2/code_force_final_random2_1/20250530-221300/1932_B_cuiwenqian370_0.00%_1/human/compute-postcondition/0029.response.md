The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 4, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '@', -float('inf') + 1 if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1]` is 2 if the first character of `path` is '@' and the second character of `path` is '@'. The rest of the values in `dp` are 0, except for `dp[2]` which is either -float('inf') if the current value of `path[i]` is '*', or `max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1` if the current value of `path[i]` is '@', `i` is 4. If `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[3]` is -float('inf'), otherwise `dp[3]` is `max(dp[2], dp[1]) + 1` if `path[3]` is '@'.**
