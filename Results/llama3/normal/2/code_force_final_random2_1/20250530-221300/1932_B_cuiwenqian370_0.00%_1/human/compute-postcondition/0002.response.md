Output State: **data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and strings of space-separated positive integers, where n is the number of integers in the following string, t is a positive integer greater than 0, index is 3, results is a list containing the result of func_1(path) where path is the string of space-separated positive integers at data[1], stdin is empty**

The code first assigns the value of the positive integer at `data[index]` to `n`, then increments `index` by 1. The value of `n` is a positive integer. The code then assigns the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[index]` to `path`, and increments `index` by 1 again. The value of `path` is a string of space-separated positive integers. The code then appends the result of `func_1(path)` to the `results` list. The value of `results` is now a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`. The value of `index` is now 3. The values of `data`, `t`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
