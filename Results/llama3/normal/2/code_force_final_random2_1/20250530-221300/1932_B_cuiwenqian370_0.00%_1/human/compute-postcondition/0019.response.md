According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and `i`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is larger than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 2. 
State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 2, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '@', -float('inf') + 1 if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1]` is 2 if the first character of `path` is '@' and the second character of `path` is '@'. The rest of the values in `dp` are 0, `i` is 2**
