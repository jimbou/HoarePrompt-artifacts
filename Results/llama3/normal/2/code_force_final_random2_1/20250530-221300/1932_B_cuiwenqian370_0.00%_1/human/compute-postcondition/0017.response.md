Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and strings of space-separated positive integers, where n is the number of integers in the following string, `t` is a positive integer equal to the first element of `data`, `index` is 2t+1, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)` where `path` is the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[2i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `t`, `result` is the last element of `results`, `stdin` is empty, and the last element of the results list which is the result of `func_1(path)` where `path` is the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[2t-1]` is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the program is such that the `data` list remains unchanged, with its first element being a positive integer `t` and the rest of the elements alternating between positive integers `n` and strings of space-separated positive integers. The `index` variable remains at `2t+1`. The `results` list contains the results of applying `func_1` to each string of space-separated positive integers in `data` at odd indices. The `result` variable now holds the last element of the `results` list. The `stdin` remains empty. Finally, the last element of the `results` list, which is the result of applying `func_1` to the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[2t-1]`, is being printed.
