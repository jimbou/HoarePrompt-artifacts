Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which all n signs will occur, based on their periodicities. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that func_1 is not relevant to the problem at hand. It seems to be a solution to a different problem, possibly related to finding the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in a path without encountering a '*' character.

On the other hand, func_2 is designed to read input from standard input, process it, and print the results. However, it calls func_1, which is not relevant to the problem.

To solve the problem, we need a function that calculates the year in which all n signs will occur, based on their periodicities. This function is missing from the given program.

Therefore, the given program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
