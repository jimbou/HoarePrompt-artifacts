To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for result in results:`, which means we can only adjust the state of the `results` list and the `result` variable.

According to the current state, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)` where `path` is the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[2i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `t`, and must have at least 1 element. The first element of the `results` list is being printed, which means we have already processed the first element.

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `results` and `result`. Since we have already processed the first element, we need to move to the next element in the `results` list.

State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and strings of space-separated positive integers, where n is the number of integers in the following string, `t` is a positive integer equal to the first element of `data` and must be at least 1, `index` is 2t+1, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)` where `path` is the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[2i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `t` and must have at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element of `results`, `stdin` is empty**
