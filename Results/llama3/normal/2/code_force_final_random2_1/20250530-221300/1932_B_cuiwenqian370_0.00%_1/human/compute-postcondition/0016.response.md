Output: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and strings of space-separated positive integers, where n is the number of integers in the following string, `t` is a positive integer equal to the first element of `data` and must be at least 1, `index` is 2t+1, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)` where `path` is the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[2i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `t` and must have at least 3 elements, `result` is the third element of `results`, `stdin` is empty, and the third element of the results list which is the result of `func_1(path)` where `path` is the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[5]` is being printed, and the result of `func_1(path)` where `path` is the string of space-separated positive integers at `data[5]` is being printed**
