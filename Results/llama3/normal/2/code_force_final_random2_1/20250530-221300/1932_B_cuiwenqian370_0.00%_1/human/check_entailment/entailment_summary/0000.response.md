Reasoning:
The provided functions do not match the problem description. The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided functions seem to be related to a different problem, involving a path with '@' and '*' characters.

Function number 1 calculates the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in a given path without encountering a '*' character, which is unrelated to the problem of finding the year of the apocalypse.

Function number 2 reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results, but it applies the func_1 function to each string of space-separated positive integers, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

Therefore, the provided functions do not meet the problem description, and the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
