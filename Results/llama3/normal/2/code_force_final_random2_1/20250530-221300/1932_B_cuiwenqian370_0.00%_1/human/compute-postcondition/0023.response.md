Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 2, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '@', -float('inf') + 1 if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[1]` is 2 if the first character of `path` is '@' and the second character of `path` is '@'. The rest of the values in `dp` are 0, except for `dp[2]` which is `max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1` because the third character of `path` is '@', `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[2]` is updated based on the values of `dp[1]` and `dp[0]`, and the fact that the third character of `path` is '@'. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
