Output State: **The program returns a list of counts of beautiful pairs for each test case in `test_cases`. The list is stored in the `results` variable.**

In this output state, the `results` list contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case in `test_cases`. The `freq` dictionary is empty, and the `beautiful_count` variable is 0. The `num` variable is the last element in the last test case's array. The `mod_x` and `mod_y` variables are the remainder of the last element in the last test case's array divided by `x` and `y` respectively. The `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` variables are the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x` and `mod_y` respectively for the last element in the last test case's array. The `test_cases` list is empty, and the `case` variable is the last test case in `test_cases`.
