Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9, and 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 for all `i`, and `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is that the initial state remains unchanged, with `t` still being a positive integer and `test_cases` still being a list of test cases with the specified properties. Additionally, a new variable `results` has been introduced, which is an empty list.
