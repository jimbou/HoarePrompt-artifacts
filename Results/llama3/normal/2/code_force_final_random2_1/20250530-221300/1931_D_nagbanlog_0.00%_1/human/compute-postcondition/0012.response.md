Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` and must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` and the value is the frequency of this tuple, `beautiful_count` is 0, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. The current value of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in the `freq` dictionary.**
