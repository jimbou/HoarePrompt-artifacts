Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9, and 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 for all `i`, and `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for case in test_cases:
    n, x, y = case['params']
    a = case['array']
    freq = {}
    beautiful_count = 0
    print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
    for num in a:
        mod_x = num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
        required_mod_y = mod_y
        print(
            f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
            )
        if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
            beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
        if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
    print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
    results.append(beautiful_count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The `results` list now contains the count of beautiful pairs, which is the value of `beautiful_count`, in addition to its previous elements. The `freq` dictionary still contains the frequency of each tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` for all elements in `a`. The `beautiful_count` variable still holds the updated count of beautiful pairs. The `num` variable still holds the value of the last element in `a`. The `mod_x` and `mod_y` variables still hold the remainder of the last element in `a` divided by `x` and `y` respectively. The `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` variables still hold the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x` and `mod_y` respectively for the last element in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `x` is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `y` is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the value of 'array' in the second test case in `test_cases` that must have at least `n` elements, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` and the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `num` is the last element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of the division of `x - mod_x` by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `y`, `test_cases` is a list with at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs and the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case is appended to it, and "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]" is printed if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, and the beautiful pairs count is printed as: "Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count]"

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, `x` is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, `y` is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, `a` is the value of 'array' in the third test case in test_cases that must have at least `n` elements, test_cases is a list with at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in test_cases, `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs and the value of beautiful_count for the third test case, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the key (mod_x, mod_y) with value equal to the number of times the pair (mod_x, mod_y) appears in the list `a`, `beautiful_count` is the sum of the values of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all pairs (mod_x, mod_y) in freq where (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, 'Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]' is printed, and this is printed: 'Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]' for all elements num in the list `a`, and this is printed: 'Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count]'




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
