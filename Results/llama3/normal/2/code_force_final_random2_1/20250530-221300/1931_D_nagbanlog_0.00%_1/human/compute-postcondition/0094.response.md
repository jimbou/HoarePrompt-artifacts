Output: **n is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, x is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, y is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, a is the value of 'array' in the third test case in test_cases that must have at least n elements and at least 2 elements, test_cases is a list with at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in test_cases, results is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, mod_x is the remainder of the second element in the list a divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of the second element in the list a divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, 'Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]' is printed, and this is printed: 'Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]' where num is the second element in the list a. If (mod_x, mod_y) is not in freq, then freq is a dictionary that contains the key (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) and the key (mod_x, mod_y) with value 0, otherwise freq remains the same and beautiful_count is the sum of its previous value and the value of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, otherwise beautiful_count remains the same. The value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] is incremented by 1, num is the second element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y.**
