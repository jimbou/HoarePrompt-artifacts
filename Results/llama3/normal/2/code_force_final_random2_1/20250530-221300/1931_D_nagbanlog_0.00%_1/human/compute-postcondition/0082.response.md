The code prints a formatted string containing information about the current test case. The string includes the value of 'num' which is the first element in the list 'a', 'mod_x' which is the remainder of the first element in the list 'a' divided by 'x', 'mod_y' which is the remainder of the first element in the list 'a' divided by 'y', 'required_mod_x' which is the remainder of 'x' minus 'mod_x' divided by 'x', and 'required_mod_y' which is equal to 'mod_y'.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y] (where num is the first element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of the first element in the list a divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of the first element in the list a divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, and required_mod_y is equal to mod_y)**
