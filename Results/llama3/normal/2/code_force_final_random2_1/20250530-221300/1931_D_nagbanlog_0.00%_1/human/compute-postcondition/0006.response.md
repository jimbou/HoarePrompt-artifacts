Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the value of case['params'][0], x is the value of case['params'][1], y is the value of case['params'][2], a is the value of case['array'] and must have at least 1 element, freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, and the message "Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]" has been printed.**

In this output state, the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x` are calculated based on the values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The value of `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. The message "Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]" has been printed, indicating that the test case is being processed. The other variables remain unchanged.
