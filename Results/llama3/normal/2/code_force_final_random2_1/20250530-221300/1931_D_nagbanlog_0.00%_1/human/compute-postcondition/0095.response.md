Output State: **`n` is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, `x` is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, `y` is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, `a` is the value of 'array' in the third test case in test_cases that must have at least `n` elements and at least 2 elements, `test_cases` is a list with at least 3 test cases, `case` is the third test case in test_cases, `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, `mod_x` is the remainder of the second element in the list `a` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of the second element in the list `a` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` and the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with value 0 if `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, otherwise `freq` remains the same, `beautiful_count` is the sum of its previous value and the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains the same, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the second element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `test_cases`, `case`, and `results` remain the same. The value of `beautiful_count` is updated by adding the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, otherwise it remains the same. The value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1. The values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are updated based on the second element of the list `a`.
