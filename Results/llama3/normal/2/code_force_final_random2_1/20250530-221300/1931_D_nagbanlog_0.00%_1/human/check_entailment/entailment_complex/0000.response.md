Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. The program iterates through each number in the array, calculates the required modular values, and updates the count of beautiful pairs accordingly.

The program uses a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each pair of modular values `(mod_x, mod_y)`. For each number in the array, it calculates the required modular values `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` and checks if this pair is already present in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it increments the count of beautiful pairs by the frequency of this pair. It then updates the frequency of the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

The program correctly handles the case where `x` or `y` is 1, as the modular arithmetic conditions are still valid in this case.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array contains duplicate numbers, as the frequency of each pair of modular values is correctly updated.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
