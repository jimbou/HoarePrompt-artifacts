Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It uses a frequency dictionary to store the count of numbers with specific modulo values for x and y. For each number, it calculates the required modulo values for x and y to form a beautiful pair and checks if such a pair exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, it increments the beautiful pair count. The program handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases where the array size is 2 or the favorite integers x and y are 1. The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
