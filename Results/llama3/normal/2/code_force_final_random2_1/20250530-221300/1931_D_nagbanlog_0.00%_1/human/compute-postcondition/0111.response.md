Output: **n is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, x is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, y is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, a is the value of 'array' in the third test case in test_cases that must have at least n elements, test_cases is a list with at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in test_cases, results is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, freq is a dictionary that contains the key (mod_x, mod_y) with value equal to the number of times the pair (mod_x, mod_y) appears in the list a, beautiful_count is the sum of the values of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] for all pairs (mod_x, mod_y) in freq where (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, 'Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]' is printed, and this is printed: 'Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]' for all elements num in the list a, and this is printed: 'Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count]'**
