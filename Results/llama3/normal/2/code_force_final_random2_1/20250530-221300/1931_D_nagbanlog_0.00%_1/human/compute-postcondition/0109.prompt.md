Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the third test case in `test_cases`, x is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the third test case in `test_cases`, y is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the third test case in `test_cases`, a is the value of 'array' in the third test case in `test_cases` that must have at least `n` elements, freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0, test_cases is a list with at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in `test_cases`, results is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, and this is printed: 'Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]'
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    print(
        f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
        )
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, x is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, y is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, a is the value of 'array' in the third test case in test_cases that must have at least n elements and at least 1 element, test_cases is a list with at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in test_cases, results is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, mod_x is the remainder of the first element in the list a divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of the first element in the list a divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, 'Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]' is printed, and this is printed: 'Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]' where num is the first element in the list a. If (mod_x, mod_y) is not in freq, then freq is a dictionary that contains the key (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) and the key (mod_x, mod_y) with value 0, otherwise freq remains the same and beautiful_count is the sum of its previous value and the value of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, otherwise beautiful_count remains the same. The value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] is incremented by 1, n is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, x is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, y is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, a is the value of 'array' in the third test case in test_cases that must have at least n elements and at least 2 elements, test_cases is a list with at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in test_cases, results is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, mod_x is the remainder of the second element in the list a divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of the second element in the list a divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, 'Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]' is printed, and this is printed: 'Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]' where num is the second element in the list a. If (mod_x, mod_y) is not in freq, then freq is a dictionary that contains the key (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) and the key (mod_x, mod_y) with value 0, otherwise freq remains the same and beautiful_count is the sum of its previous value and the value of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, otherwise beautiful_count remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] is incremented by 1, n is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, x is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, y is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, a is the value of 'array' in the third test case in test_cases that must have at least n+1 elements and at least 3 elements, test_cases is a list with at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in test_cases, results is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, mod_x is the remainder of the third element in the list a divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of the third element in the list a divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, 'Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]' is printed, and this is printed: 'Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]' where num is the third element in the list a. If (mod_x, mod_y) is not in freq, then freq is a dictionary that contains the key (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) and the key (mod_x, mod_y) with value 0, otherwise freq remains the same and beautiful_count is the sum of its previous value and the value of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, otherwise beautiful_count remains the same, and this is printed: 'Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]' where num is the third element in the list a. If (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, then the value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
