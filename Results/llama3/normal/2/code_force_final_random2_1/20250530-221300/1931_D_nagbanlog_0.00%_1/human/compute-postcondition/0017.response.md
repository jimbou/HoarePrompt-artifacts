Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the value of case['params'][0], x is the value of case['params'][1], y is the value of case['params'][2], a is the value of case['array'] and must have at least 2 elements, freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) and the value is the frequency of this tuple, beautiful_count is increased by the frequency of the tuple (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in the freq dictionary if the tuple (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in the freq dictionary, otherwise beautiful_count remains 0, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, and the frequency of the tuple (mod_x, mod_y) in the freq dictionary is increased by 1, and num is the second element in the list**
