This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers. It processes each test case, calculates the count of "beautiful pairs" based on the given conditions, and returns a list of these counts for all test cases. A beautiful pair is defined as two numbers in the list that satisfy certain modular arithmetic conditions with respect to x and y. The function iterates through each number in the list, calculates the required modular values, and updates the count of beautiful pairs accordingly. The final state of the program is a list of beautiful pair counts, one for each test case.
