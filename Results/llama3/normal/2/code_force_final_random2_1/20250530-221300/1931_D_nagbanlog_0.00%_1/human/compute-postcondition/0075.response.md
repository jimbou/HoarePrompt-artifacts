Output State: **`n` is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `x` is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `y` is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the value of 'array' in the second test case in `test_cases` that must have at least `n` elements, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` and the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `num` is the last element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of the division of `x - mod_x` by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `y`, `test_cases` is a list with at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs and the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case is appended to it, and "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]" is printed if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, and the beautiful pairs count is printed as: "Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count]"**

The code appends the current beautiful pairs count to the `results` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
