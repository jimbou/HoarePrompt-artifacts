Output State: **`n` is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the second test case in test_cases, `x` is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the second test case in test_cases, `y` is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the second test case in test_cases, `a` is the value of 'array' in the second test case in test_cases that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) and the value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] is increased by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, `num` is the first element in a, `mod_x` is the remainder of the division of num by x, `mod_y` is the remainder of the division of num by y, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of the division of x - mod_x by x, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of the division of num by y, `test_cases` is a list with at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in test_cases, `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, and this is printed: "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]". If (mod_x, mod_y) is not in freq, then freq contains the key-value pair (mod_x, mod_y) with value 1.**

The code increments the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1. The value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` was either 0 (if (mod_x, mod_y) was not in freq) or some positive integer (if (mod_x, mod_y) was in freq). After the code is executed, the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is either 1 (if (mod_x, mod_y) was not in freq) or some positive integer greater than its previous value (if (mod_x, mod_y) was in freq). The values of the other variables are not affected.
