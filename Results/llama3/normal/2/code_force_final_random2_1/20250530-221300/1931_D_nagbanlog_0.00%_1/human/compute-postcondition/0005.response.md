To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `a` (which is the same as `case['array']`) because it's the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `a` is already defined as the value of `case['array']`, we don't need to adjust its value. However, we need to ensure that `a` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the value of case['params'][0], x is the value of case['params'][1], y is the value of case['params'][2], a is the value of case['array'] and must have at least 1 element, freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0, and this is printed: "Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]"**
