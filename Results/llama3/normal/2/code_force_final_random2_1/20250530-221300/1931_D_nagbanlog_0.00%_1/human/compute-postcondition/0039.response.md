Output State: **`n` is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `x` is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `y` is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the value of 'array' in the second test case in `test_cases`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `num` is not defined, `mod_x` is not defined, `mod_y` is not defined, `required_mod_x` is not defined, `required_mod_y` is not defined, `test_cases` is a list with at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of the first, second, and third elements in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, respectively. The value of `a` is updated to the value of 'array' in the second test case in `test_cases`. The `freq` dictionary is reset to an empty dictionary, and the `beautiful_count` variable is reset to 0. The `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` variables are not defined. The `test_cases` list still has at least 2 test cases, and the `case` variable still refers to the second test case in `test_cases`. The `results` list still contains the count of beautiful pairs.
