Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the value of case['params'][0], x is the value of case['params'][1], y is the value of case['params'][2], a is the value of case['array'], freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are determined by the values of `case['params']` and `case['array']`, which are part of the initial state. The variables `freq` and `beautiful_count` are initialized to an empty dictionary and 0, respectively, as a result of the code execution. The other variables, `t`, `test_cases`, `case`, and `results`, remain unchanged from their initial state.
