Output State: **The `results` list contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case in `test_cases`. The `freq` dictionary is empty. The `beautiful_count` variable is 0. The `num` variable is the last element in the last test case's array. The `mod_x` and `mod_y` variables are the remainder of the last element in the last test case's array divided by `x` and `y` respectively. The `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` variables are the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x` and `mod_y` respectively for the last element in the last test case's array. The `test_cases` list is empty. The `case` variable is the last test case in `test_cases`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the `results` list will contain the count of beautiful pairs for each test case in `test_cases`. The `freq` dictionary will be empty since it is reinitialized for each test case. The `beautiful_count` variable will be 0 since it is reinitialized for each test case. The `num` variable will hold the value of the last element in the last test case's array. The `mod_x` and `mod_y` variables will hold the remainder of the last element in the last test case's array divided by `x` and `y` respectively. The `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` variables will hold the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x` and `mod_y` respectively for the last element in the last test case's array. The `test_cases` list will be empty since all test cases have been processed. The `case` variable will hold the last test case in `test_cases`.
