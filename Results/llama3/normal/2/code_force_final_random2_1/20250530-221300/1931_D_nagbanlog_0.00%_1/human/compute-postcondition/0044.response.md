Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y] (where num is the first element in 'array' in the second test case in test_cases, mod_x is the remainder of the division of num by x, mod_y is the remainder of the division of num by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of the division of x - mod_x by x, and required_mod_y is the remainder of the division of num by y)**
