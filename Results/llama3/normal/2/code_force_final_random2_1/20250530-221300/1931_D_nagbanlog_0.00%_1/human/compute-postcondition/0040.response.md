The code prints a formatted string indicating the values of the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` for the second test case in `test_cases`. 

Here, `n` is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `x` is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `y` is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, and `a` is the value of 'array' in the second test case in `test_cases`.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where n is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the second test case in test_cases, x is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the second test case in test_cases, y is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the second test case in test_cases, and a is the value of 'array' in the second test case in test_cases)**
