Output State: **The `results` list now contains the count of beautiful pairs, which is the value of `beautiful_count`, in addition to its previous elements. The `freq` dictionary still contains the frequency of each tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` for all elements in `a`. The `beautiful_count` variable still holds the updated count of beautiful pairs. The `num` variable still holds the value of the last element in `a`. The `mod_x` and `mod_y` variables still hold the remainder of the last element in `a` divided by `x` and `y` respectively. The `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` variables still hold the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x` and `mod_y` respectively for the last element in `a`.**

In natural language, the code appends the current count of beautiful pairs to the `results` list, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged.
