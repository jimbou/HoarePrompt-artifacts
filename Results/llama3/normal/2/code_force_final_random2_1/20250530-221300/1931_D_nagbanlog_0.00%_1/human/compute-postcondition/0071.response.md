Output State: `n` is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `x` is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `y` is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the value of 'array' in the second test case in `test_cases`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` and the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1 for each number in `a`, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `num` is the last element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of the division of `x - mod_x` by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `y`, `test_cases` is a list with at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, and "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]" is printed for each number in `a`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `test_cases`, `case`, and `results` remain unchanged. The variable `a` is the same as the input array. The variable `freq` is a dictionary that stores the frequency of each pair of remainders `(mod_x, mod_y)` for each number in the array `a`. The variable `beautiful_count` is the total count of beautiful pairs, which is the sum of the frequencies of the pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` that are present in the dictionary `freq`. The variables `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are the values of the last number processed in the array `a`.
