You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: The value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] is incremented by 1, n is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, x is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, y is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the third test case in test_cases, a is the value of 'array' in the third test case in test_cases that must have at least n elements and at least 2 elements, test_cases is a list with at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in test_cases, results is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, mod_x is the remainder of the second element in the list a divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of the second element in the list a divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, 'Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]' is printed, and this is printed: 'Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]' where num is the second element in the list a. If (mod_x, mod_y) is not in freq, then freq is a dictionary that contains the key (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) and the key (mod_x, mod_y) with value 0, otherwise freq remains the same and beautiful_count is the sum of its previous value and the value of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, otherwise beautiful_count remains the same.
```
for num in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
