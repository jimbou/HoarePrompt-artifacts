Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` and must have at least 3 elements, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` and the value is the frequency of this tuple, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the frequency of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary is increased by 1 if `(mod_x, mod_y)` is already in the dictionary, otherwise it is set to 1, `num` is the third element in the list, and `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary, and this is printed: 'Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]'.***
