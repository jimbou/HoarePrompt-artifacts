The code prints a formatted string indicating the count of beautiful pairs.
The count of beautiful pairs is the sum of the values of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] for all pairs (mod_x, mod_y) in freq where (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq.
Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the sum of the values of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] for all pairs (mod_x, mod_y) in freq where (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq)**
