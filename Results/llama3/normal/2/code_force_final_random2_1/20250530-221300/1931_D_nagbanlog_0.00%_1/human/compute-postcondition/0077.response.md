Output State: **n is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the third test case in `test_cases`, x is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the third test case in `test_cases`, y is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the third test case in `test_cases`, a is the value of 'array' in the third test case in `test_cases` that must have at least `n` elements, freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0, test_cases is a list with at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in `test_cases`, results is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs.**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `test_cases`, or `case`. It initializes an empty dictionary `freq` and sets `beautiful_count` to 0. The list `results` is also not modified in this code snippet, as it is only appended to in the original code, but not in the provided snippet.
