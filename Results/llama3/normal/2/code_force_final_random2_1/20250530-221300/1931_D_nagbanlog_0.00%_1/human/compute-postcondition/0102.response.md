Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y] (where num is the third element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of the third element in the list a divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of the third element in the list a divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, and required_mod_y is equal to mod_y)**
