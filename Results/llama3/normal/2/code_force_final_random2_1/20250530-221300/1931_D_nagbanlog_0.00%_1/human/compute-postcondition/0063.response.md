Output State: **n is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, x is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, y is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, a is the value of 'array' in the second test case in `test_cases` that must have at least 3 elements, freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` and the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, beautiful_count is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, num is the third element in `a`, mod_x is the remainder of the division of `num` by `x`, mod_y is the remainder of the division of `num` by `y`, required_mod_x is the remainder of the division of `x - mod_x` by `x`, required_mod_y is the remainder of the division of `num` by `y`, test_cases is a list with at least 2 test cases, case is the second test case in `test_cases`, results is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, and this is printed: "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]"**

The code snippet modifies the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` based on the values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The `mod_x` is calculated as the remainder of the division of `num` by `x`, and `mod_y` is calculated as the remainder of the division of `num` by `y`. The `required_mod_x` is calculated as the remainder of the division of `x - mod_x` by `x`, and `required_mod_y` is the same as `mod_y`. The code also prints the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
