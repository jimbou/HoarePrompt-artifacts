Output State: **n is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the second test case in test_cases, x is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the second test case in test_cases, y is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the second test case in test_cases, a is the value of 'array' in the second test case in test_cases that must have at least 1 element, freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0, num is the first element in a, mod_x is the remainder of the division of num by x, mod_y is the remainder of the division of num by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of the division of x - mod_x by x, required_mod_y is the remainder of the division of num by y, test_cases is a list with at least 2 test cases, case is the second test case in test_cases, results is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs.**

In this final state, the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` have been calculated based on the initial values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The remainder of the division of `num` by `x` is assigned to `mod_x`, and the remainder of the division of `num` by `y` is assigned to `mod_y`. Then, the remainder of the division of `x - mod_x` by `x` is assigned to `required_mod_x`, and the remainder of the division of `num` by `y` is assigned to `required_mod_y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
