Postcondition: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, case is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the value of case['params'][0], x is the value of case['params'][1], y is the value of case['params'][2], a is the value of case['array'] and must have at least 1 element, freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) and the value is the frequency of this tuple, beautiful_count is 0, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, and the message "Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]" has been printed, and this is printed: "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]". The current value of freq contains the tuple (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) as a key.**
