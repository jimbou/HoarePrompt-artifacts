Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `x` is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `y` is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the value of 'array' in the second test case in `test_cases`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `num` is not defined, `mod_x` is not defined, `mod_y` is not defined, `required_mod_x` is not defined, `required_mod_y` is not defined, `test_cases` is a list with at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, and this is printed: 'Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]'
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    print(
        f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
        )
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the second test case in test_cases, `x` is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the second test case in test_cases, `y` is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the second test case in test_cases, `a` is the value of 'array' in the second test case in test_cases that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) and the value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] is increased by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, `num` is the first element in a, `mod_x` is the remainder of the division of num by x, `mod_y` is the remainder of the division of num by y, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of the division of x - mod_x by x, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of the division of num by y, `test_cases` is a list with at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in test_cases, `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, and this is printed: "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]". If (mod_x, mod_y) is not in freq, then freq contains the key-value pair (mod_x, mod_y) with value 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `x` is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `y` is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the value of 'array' in the second test case in `test_cases` that must have at least 2 elements, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` and the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `num` is the second element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of the division of `x - mod_x` by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `y`, `test_cases` is a list with at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, and this is printed: "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]". If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, then `freq` contains the key-value pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` with value 1. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `freq` contains the key-value pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` with value increased by 1 and `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `freq` contains the key-value pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` with value 0, and if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `freq` contains the key-value pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` with value increased by 0 and `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the value of the first element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `x` is the value of the second element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `y` is the value of the third element in the 'params' list of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the value of 'array' in the second test case in `test_cases` that must have at least 3 elements, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` and the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `num` is the third element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of the division of `x - mod_x` by `x`, `required_mod_y` is the remainder of the division of `num` by `y`, `test_cases` is a list with at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the count of beautiful pairs, and "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]" is printed if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
