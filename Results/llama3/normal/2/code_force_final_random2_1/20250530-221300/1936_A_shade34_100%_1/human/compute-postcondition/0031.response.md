Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a string containing the input value, the output is cleared, and the current value of `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing the value 0**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `i` is 0, `pans` now contains the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
