Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is 3, `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed. If the input is '<', then `_` is 0. Otherwise, `_` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mak` is now 3, which is the same as the value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The output buffer is still flushed, and the same messages are printed. The value of `_` is still 0, regardless of the input.
