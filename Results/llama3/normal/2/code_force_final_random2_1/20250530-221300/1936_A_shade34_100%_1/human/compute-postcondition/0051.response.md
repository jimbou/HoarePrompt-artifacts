Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing all `i` for which the input is '=' or '<', stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 0, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The output buffer is still flushed, and the same output is printed as before.
