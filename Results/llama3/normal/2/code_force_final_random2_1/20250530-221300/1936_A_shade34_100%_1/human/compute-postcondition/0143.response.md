Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `mak` is 2 if the input string is '>' otherwise `mak` is 1, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least 4 elements, `pans` contains `i` if `s` is '=' otherwise `pans` is a list containing 0 if `s` is '<' otherwise `pans` is an empty list, and if `s` is '=' then `i` is appended to `pans` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? `[mak2]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! `[mak2]` `[pans[mak]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and `s` is '=' if `s` is '=' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and `s` is the input string. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 0 and `pans` is a list containing 0. If `s` is '=', then `pans` contains an additional element `i`, and this is printed: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed. The current value of `s` is '>' if the input string is '>' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<'. and this is printed: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]**, and the output buffer is flushed.**

The output state is the same as the initial state because the code `sys.stdout.flush()` only flushes the output buffer, but does not change the values of any variables.
