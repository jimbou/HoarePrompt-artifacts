Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

* `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements.
* `mak` is 0.
* `i` is 1.

The print statement is: `print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`

Using the values of the variables, we can substitute them into the print statement:

* `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`, which is the first element of the `pans` list.
* `pans[i]` is `pans[1]`, which is the second element of the `pans` list.

Since the exact elements of the `pans` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `pans[0]` and `pans[1]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the first and second elements of the `pans` list, repeated twice, with a '?' character at the beginning.

Output: **? [first element of pans], [first element of pans], [second element of pans], [second element of pans]**
