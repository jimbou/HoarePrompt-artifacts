Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is 2 if the input is '<', otherwise it remains 1, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 1 or 2 depending on the input), followed by the value of `mak` again, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3.**
