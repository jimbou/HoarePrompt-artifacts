Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the input string is '>' otherwise `mak` is 0, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `pans` contains `i` if `s` is '=' otherwise `pans` is a list containing 0 if `s` is '<' otherwise `pans` is an empty list, and if `s` is '=' then `i` is appended to `pans` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? `[mak2]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! `[mak2]` `[pans[mak]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and `s` is '=' if `s` is '=' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and `s` is the input string. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 0 and `pans` is a list containing 0. If `s` is '=', then `pans` contains an additional element `i`, and this is printed: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed. The current value of `s` is '>' if the input string is '>' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<'. and this is printed: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any pending output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer contains a series of print statements that were previously executed. The flush operation does not change the values of any variables, but it ensures that the output is immediately visible.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is now empty and the output is immediately visible.
