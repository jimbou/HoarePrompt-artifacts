Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` is not empty and contains the string '<', the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1**

The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer is still flushed, and the same string is printed. The stdin still contains the string '<'.
