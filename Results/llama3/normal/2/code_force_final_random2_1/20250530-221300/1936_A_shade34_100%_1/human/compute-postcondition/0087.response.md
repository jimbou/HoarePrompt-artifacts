Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing all `i` for which the input is '=' or '<', `stdin` is either empty or contains a single '<' character, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and the current value of the input is either '<' or empty, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed again. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, `_`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain the same, and the output buffer is flushed, with the same printed messages as before. The only change is that the output buffer is flushed again, indicating that any pending output is sent to the output device.
