The code assigns the value of `i` to `mak` and creates a list `pans` containing the value of `i`. Since `i` is 1, `mak` becomes 1 and `pans` becomes `[1]`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, s is a string containing the input value, the output is cleared and contains the input value, mak is 1, pans is [1], mak2 is not defined**
