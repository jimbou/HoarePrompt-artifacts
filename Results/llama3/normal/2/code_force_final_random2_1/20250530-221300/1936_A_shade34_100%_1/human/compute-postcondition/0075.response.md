The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the input. If `_` is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and stdin is empty. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, and stdin must contain an integer greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mak` is `len(pans)-1`, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing all `i` for which the input is '=' or '<', stdin is not empty and contains an integer greater than 0, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and the output buffer is flushed.**
