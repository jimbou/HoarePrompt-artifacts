Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mak` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing all `i` for which the input is '=' or '<', `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged.
* The value of `i` is now equal to `n`.
* The value of `mak` is the last index `i` for which the input is '<'.
* The value of `_` remains unchanged at 1.
* The value of `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input is '<'.
* The value of `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input is '=' or '<'.
* The `stdin` is empty.
* The output buffer is flushed.
* The printed output includes the initial output, followed by the output for each iteration of the loop, and finally the output after the loop finishes.
