Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `pans` is a list containing at least 3 elements, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer is flushed again.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
