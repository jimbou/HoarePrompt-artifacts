Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is n, mak is the last i for which the input is '<', _ is 1, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list containing i if s is '=' otherwise pans is a list containing 0 if s is '<' otherwise pans is an empty list, and if s is '=' then i is appended to pans for all i from 0 to n-1, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each i from 2 to n-1: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each i from 1 to len(pans)-1: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], and s is '=' if s is '=' otherwise s is not equal to '<', and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], and s is the input string. If s is '<', then mak is n-1 and pans is a list containing n-1. If s is '=', then pans contains an additional element i.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The loop has executed n times, where n is a positive integer.
* The variable i has reached its final value, which is n.
* The variable mak has been updated to the last index i for which the input string s is '<'.
* The variable mak2 has also been updated to the last index i for which the input string s is '<'.
* The list pans has been populated with the indices i for which the input string s is '='. If s is '<', then pans contains only the last index i for which s is '<'. If s is '=', then pans contains all the indices i for which s is '='.
* The output buffer has been flushed, and the following messages have been printed:
	+ ? 0 0 1 1
	+ ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i] for each i from 2 to n-1
	+ ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] for each i from 1 to len(pans)-1
	+ ! [mak2] [pans[mak]]
	+ ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i]
	+ ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2]
	+ ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] and s is the input string.
* If s is '<', then mak is n-1 and pans is a list containing n-1. If s is '=', then pans contains an additional element i.
