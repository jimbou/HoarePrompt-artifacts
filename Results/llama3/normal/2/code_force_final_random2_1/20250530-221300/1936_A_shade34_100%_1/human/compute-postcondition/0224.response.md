Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `len(pans)-1`, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing at least `len(pans)` elements, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`. If the input is '>', then `s` is '>', `mak` is `len(pans)-1`. Otherwise, `s` is the input string and `mak` is 0. and this is printed: '!' followed by the last index for which the input is '<' which is `mak2` and the last element of the list `pans` which is `pans[mak]`**
