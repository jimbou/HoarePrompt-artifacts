Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, i is n, mak is the last i for which the input is '<', _ is 1, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is an empty list, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each i from 2 to n-1: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each i from 1 to len(pans)-1: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is greater than 0, i is 0, mak is the last i for which the input is '<', _ is 1, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list containing i if s is '=' otherwise pans is a list containing 0 if s is '<' otherwise pans is an empty list, stdin contains a string s, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each i from 2 to n-1: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each i from 1 to len(pans)-1: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], and s is '=' if s is '=' otherwise s is not equal to '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is greater than 1, i is 1, mak is the last i for which the input is '<', _ is 1, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list containing i if s is '=' otherwise pans is a list containing 0 if s is '<' otherwise pans is an empty list, and if s is '=' then i is appended to pans, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each i from 2 to n-1: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each i from 1 to len(pans)-1: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], and s is '=' if s is '=' otherwise s is not equal to '<', and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], and s is the input string. If s is '<', then mak is 1 and pans is a list containing 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 2, i is 2, mak is the last i for which the input is '<', _ is 1, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list containing i if s is '=' otherwise pans is a list containing 0 if s is '<' otherwise pans is an empty list, and if s is '=' then i is appended to pans, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each i from 2 to n-1: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each i from 1 to len(pans)-1: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], and s is '=' if s is '=' otherwise s is not equal to '<', and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], and s is the input string. If s is '<', then mak is 2 and pans is a list containing 2. If s is '=', then pans contains an additional element i.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
