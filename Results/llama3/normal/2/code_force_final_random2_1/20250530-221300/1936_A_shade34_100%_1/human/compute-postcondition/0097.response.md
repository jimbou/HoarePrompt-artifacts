Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, i is n, mak is the last i for which the input is '<', _ is 1, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is an empty list, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each i from 2 to n-1: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each i from 1 to len(pans)-1: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.**

In this final state, the value of `mak2` is updated to be the same as `mak`, which is the last `i` for which the input is '<'. The list `pans` is reset to an empty list. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
