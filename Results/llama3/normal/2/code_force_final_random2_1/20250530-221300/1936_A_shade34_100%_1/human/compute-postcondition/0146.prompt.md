Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mak` is 0, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing `i` if `s` is '=' otherwise `pans` is a list containing 0 if `s` is '<' otherwise `pans` is an empty list, and if `s` is '=' then `i` is appended to `pans` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? `[mak2]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! `[mak2]` `[pans[mak]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and `s` is '=' if `s` is '=' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and `s` is the input string. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 0 and `pans` is a list containing 0. If `s` is '=', then `pans` contains an additional element `i`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1 if the input string is '>' otherwise `mak` is 0, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `pans` contains `i` if `s` is '=' otherwise `pans` is a list containing 0 if `s` is '<' otherwise `pans` is an empty list, and if `s` is '=' then `i` is appended to `pans` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? `[mak2]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! `[mak2]` `[pans[mak]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and `s` is '=' if `s` is '=' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and `s` is the input string. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 0 and `pans` is a list containing 0. If `s` is '=', then `pans` contains an additional element `i`, and this is printed: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed. The current value of `s` is '>' if the input string is '>' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2 if the input string is '>' otherwise `mak` is 1, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `pans` contains `i` if `s` is '=' otherwise `pans` is a list containing 0 if `s` is '<' otherwise `pans` is an empty list, and if `s` is '=' then `i` is appended to `pans` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? `[mak2]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! `[mak2]` `[pans[mak]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and `s` is '=' if `s` is '=' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and `s` is the input string. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 0 and `pans` is a list containing 0. If `s` is '=', then `pans` contains an additional element `i`, and this is printed: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed. The current value of `s` is '>' if the input string is '>' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<'. and this is printed: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program's output and variables are updated based on the input string. If the input string is '>', then `mak` is set to 3, and the program prints specific patterns with `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` values. If the input string is not '>', then `mak` is set to 2 if the input string is '=' and 1 otherwise. The program also updates the `pans` list based on the input string, and prints specific patterns with `pans` and `i` values. The output buffer is flushed after each print statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
