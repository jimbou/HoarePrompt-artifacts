Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mak` is `len(pans)-1`, `_` is 0, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing all `i` for which the input is '=' or '<', stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed again. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, `_`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged. The output buffer is flushed, which means that any buffered output is sent to the output device. The printed output remains the same as before, with the addition of the flushed output buffer.
