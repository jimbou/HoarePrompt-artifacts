Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the input value, mak is 0, i is len(pans), _ is 2, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list that must have at least len(pans) elements, s is the input string, stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '<':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise it remains 0, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2 if the input is '<', otherwise it remains 1, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], where mak is 2 if the input is '<', otherwise it remains 1, and i is 2, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 1 or 2 depending on the input), followed by the value of `mak` again, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3, and the output buffer is flushed. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 3 and `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<'. Otherwise, `mak` remains 1 or 2 depending on the input and `mak2` is not updated.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
