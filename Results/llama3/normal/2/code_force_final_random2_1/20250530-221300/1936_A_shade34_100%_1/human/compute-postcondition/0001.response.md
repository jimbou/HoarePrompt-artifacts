Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, mak is 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since the input is greater than 0, `n` becomes a positive integer. The second line assigns 0 to `mak`, so `mak` becomes 0. The third line does not affect any variables. The fourth line does not exist, so it does not affect any variables. 

The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin is now empty since the input has been consumed.
