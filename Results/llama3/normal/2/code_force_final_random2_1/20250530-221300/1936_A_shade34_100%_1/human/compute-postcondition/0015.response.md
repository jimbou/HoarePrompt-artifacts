To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is already greater than 2, it remains the same.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2 and `_` is 0. Otherwise, `mak` is 1 and `_` is 0.**
