Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing 1 if the input string `s` is '<', otherwise it contains 0 and then 2, stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`. If the input string `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1, and this is printed: "? [1] [mak2] [1] [mak2]". If the input string `s` is '=', then `mak` is 0, and this is printed: "? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2]". Otherwise, `mak` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', and this is printed: "? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2]".**
