Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1", so this string is printed to the output stream. The output buffer is then empty. The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.
