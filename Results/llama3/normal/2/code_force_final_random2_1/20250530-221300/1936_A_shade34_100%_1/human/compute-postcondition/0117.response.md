The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, mak is the last i for which the input is '<', _ is 1, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list containing i if s is '=' otherwise pans is a list containing 0 if s is '<' otherwise pans is an empty list, and if s is '=' then i is appended to pans, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each i from 2 to n-1: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each i from 1 to len(pans)-1: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], and s is '=' if s is '=' otherwise s is not equal to '<', and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], and s is the input string. If s is '<', then mak is 1 and pans is a list containing 1.**
