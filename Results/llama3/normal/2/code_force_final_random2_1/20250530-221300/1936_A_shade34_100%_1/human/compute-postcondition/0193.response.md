To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is 1, we can increment it by 1 to make it 2. Now, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`. If the input string `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1, `pans` is a list containing 1, and this is printed: "? [1] [mak2] [1] [mak2]". Otherwise, `mak` is 0 if the input string `s` is '=' or '<', otherwise it is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing 0 if the input string `s` is '=' or '<', otherwise it contains 1, and this is printed: "? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2]"**
