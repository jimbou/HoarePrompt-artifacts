Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise it remains 0, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the output buffer is flushed.***
