Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, mak is 0, _ is 1, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list containing all i for which the input is '=' or '<', stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each i from 2 to n-1: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each i from 1 to len(pans)-1: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, `_`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged, and the output buffer is flushed, meaning that any pending output is sent to the output device.
