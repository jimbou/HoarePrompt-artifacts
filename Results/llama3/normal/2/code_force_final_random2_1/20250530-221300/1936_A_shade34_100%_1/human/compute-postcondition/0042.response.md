The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, s is a string containing the input value, the output is cleared and contains the input value. If s is equal to '<', then mak is 1, pans is [1], and mak2 is not defined. If s is equal to '=', then pans is a list containing the integer 1, otherwise, pans is not defined. In all cases, mak and mak2 are not defined if s is not equal to '<'.**
