Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `mak` is 3, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer is flushed again. If the input is not '> ', then the program does nothing. and this is printed: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]].**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `mak` which is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. The rest of the state remains unchanged, including the printed output and the flushed output buffer.
