To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `pans`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `pans`. If `pans` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.**
