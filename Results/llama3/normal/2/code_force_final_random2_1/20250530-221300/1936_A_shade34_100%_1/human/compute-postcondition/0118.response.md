Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

* `mak` is the last `i` for which the input is '<'. Since `s` is '=' if `s` is '=' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', we can conclude that `s` is not '<'. Therefore, `mak` is not updated and remains as its initial value, which is not specified. However, since `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', and `mak2` is equal to `mak`, we can conclude that `mak` is also equal to `mak2`.
* `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<'. Since `s` is '=' if `s` is '=' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', we can conclude that `s` is not '<'. Therefore, `mak2` is not updated and remains as its initial value, which is 1.
* `i` is 2.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`

The print statement will print the string '?' followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.

Since `mak` is equal to `mak2`, and `mak2` is 1, the print statement will print:

`? 1 1 2 1`

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 1 1 2 1**
