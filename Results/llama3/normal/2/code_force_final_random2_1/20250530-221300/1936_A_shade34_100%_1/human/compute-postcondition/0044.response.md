Output: **n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, s is a string containing the input value, the output is cleared and contains the input value. If s is equal to '<', then mak is 1, pans is [1], and mak2 is not defined. If s is equal to '=', then pans is a list containing the integer 1, otherwise, pans is not defined. In all cases, mak and mak2 are not defined if s is not equal to '<'. The following is printed: '?' , the value of mak (which is 1 if s is equal to '<', otherwise not defined), the value of mak2 (which is not defined), the value of i which is 2, and the value of mak2 (which is not defined)**
