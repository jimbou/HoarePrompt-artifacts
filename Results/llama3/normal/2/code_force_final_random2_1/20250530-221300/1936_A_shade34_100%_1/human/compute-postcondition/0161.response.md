Based on the precondition, let's break down the variables and objects that will be printed:

* `?`: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `mak`: This variable is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise it remains 0. Since the input is not specified, we can't determine the exact value of `mak`. However, we can describe it as "1 if the input is '<', otherwise 0".
* `mak`: This is the same variable as above, so it will have the same value.
* `i`: This variable is 2, so it will be printed as 2.
* `i`: This is the same variable as above, so it will be printed as 2 again.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 1(if the input is '<', otherwise 0) 1(if the input is '<', otherwise 0) 2 2**
