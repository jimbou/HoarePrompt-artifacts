Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` is not empty and contains the string '<' if the input is '<', otherwise `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the output buffer is flushed. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the output buffer is flushed, meaning that any pending output is sent to the output device. The output buffer being flushed does not change the values of the variables or the contents of the output, but rather ensures that the output is displayed immediately.
