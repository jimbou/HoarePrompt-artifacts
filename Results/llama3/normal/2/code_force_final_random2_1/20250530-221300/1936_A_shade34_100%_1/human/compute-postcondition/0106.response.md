Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mak` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing `i`, stdin contains a string `s`, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? `[mak2]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! `[mak2]` `[pans[mak]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and the current value of `s` is '='**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is appended to the list `pans`. The rest of the variables and printed statements remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `pans` now contains the value of `i`, which is 0.
