Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 2, _ is 2, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', s is the input string, stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, mak is 2, pans is a list containing 2.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `mak`, making `mak` equal to 2. It also creates a list `pans` containing the value of `i`, which is 2. No other variables are affected.
