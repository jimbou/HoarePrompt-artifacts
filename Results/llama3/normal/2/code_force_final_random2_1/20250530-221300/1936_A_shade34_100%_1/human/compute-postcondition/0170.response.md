Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is 3, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 1 or 2 depending on the input), followed by the value of `mak` again, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, and finally followed by the value of `i` again which is 3, and the output buffer is flushed.**

The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer is still flushed, and the printed output remains the same.
