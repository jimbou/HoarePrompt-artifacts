Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing all `i` for which the input is '=' or '<', `stdin` is either empty or contains a single '<' character, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and the current value of the input is either '<' or empty, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `mak` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
