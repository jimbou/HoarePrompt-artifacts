Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing all `i` for which the input is '=' or '<', stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed. If the input is '>', then `mak` is 1 and `_` is 0. Otherwise, `mak` and `_` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing at least 3 elements, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer is flushed again. If the input is not '> ', then the program does nothing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program executes as follows: if the input is '> ', then the program prints a series of strings in a specific format, including '? 0 0 1 1' and '? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i]' for each 'i' from 2 to 'n-1', and finally '? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]', with the output buffer flushed after each print. If the input is not '> ', the program does nothing. In either case, 'n' remains an integer greater than 0, 'i' remains 3, and 'pans' remains a list containing at least 3 elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
