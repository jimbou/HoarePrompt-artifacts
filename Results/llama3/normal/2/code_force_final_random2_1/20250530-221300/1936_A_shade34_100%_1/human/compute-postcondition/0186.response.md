The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i`, and the value of `mak2` again.

Since `mak` is 0 if the input string `s` is '<', otherwise it is the last `i` for which the input is '<', and `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', the values of `mak` and `mak2` will be the same.

The value of `i` is 1.

Therefore, the output will be a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak` (or `mak2`), the value of `i`, and the value of `mak2` (or `mak`) again.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak]**
