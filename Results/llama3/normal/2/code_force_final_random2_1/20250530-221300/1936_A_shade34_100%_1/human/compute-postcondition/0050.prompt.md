Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, i is n, mak is n-1 if all inputs are '<', otherwise mak is the last i for which the input is '<', _ is 0, mak2 is n-1 if all inputs are '<', otherwise mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is an empty list, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each i from 2 to n-1: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, s is a string containing the input value, and the output is cleared. If s is '<', then mak is 0, pans is a list containing a single element 0. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, s is a string containing the input value, the output is cleared and contains the input value. If s is equal to '<', then mak is 1, pans is [1], and mak2 is not defined. If s is equal to '=', then pans is a list containing the integer 1, otherwise, pans is not defined. In all cases, mak and mak2 are not defined if s is not equal to '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, s is a string containing the new input value, the output is cleared and contains the new input value, the value '?' is printed, the value of mak (which is 2 if the new input value is '<', otherwise not defined), the value of mak2 (which is not defined), if s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value 2. Otherwise, if s is '<', then pans is a list containing the value 2, otherwise pans is not defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
