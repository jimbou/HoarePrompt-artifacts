To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(pans)):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `pans`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `pans` is a list containing at least 3 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The length of `pans` does not change, so `len(pans)` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is 3
* `pans` is a list containing at least 3 elements

The other variables, such as `n`, `stdin`, the output buffer, and the printed output, are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing at least 3 elements, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer is flushed again. If the input is not '> ', then the program does nothing.**
