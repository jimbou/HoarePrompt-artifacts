Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `mak` is the last i for which the input is '<', `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last i for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing 0, `s` is the input string and its current value is '=', stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], where mak is the last i for which the input is '<', and i is 0, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], where mak is the last i for which the input is '<', mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', and i is 0, the output buffer is flushed, and s is '='.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `pans` now contains the value 0, which was appended to it by the executed code. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
