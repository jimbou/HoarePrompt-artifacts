Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is a string containing the input value, the output is cleared and contains the input value, `pans` is a list containing the integer 1, `mak` is not defined, `mak2` is not defined**

In this output state, the code has appended the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `pans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `pans` was not defined initially, but after the code execution, it is now defined as a list containing the integer 1.
