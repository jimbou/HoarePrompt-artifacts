Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, i is n, mak is 0, _ is 1, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list containing all i for which the input is '=' or '<', stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each i from 2 to n-1: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each i from 1 to len(pans)-1: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and the output buffer is flushed.**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, making stdin empty. The second line assigns 0 to `mak`, overwriting its previous value. The values of `i`, `_`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged. The output buffer is flushed, and the printed output remains the same as before the code execution.
