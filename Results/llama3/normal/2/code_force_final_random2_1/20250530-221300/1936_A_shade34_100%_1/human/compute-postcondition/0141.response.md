To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's analyze the given precondition and the Python code snippet.

The precondition states that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `mak` is 2 if the input string is '>' otherwise `mak` is 1, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least 4 elements, `pans` contains `i` if `s` is '=' otherwise `pans` is a list containing 0 if `s` is '<' otherwise `pans` is an empty list, and if `s` is '=' then `i` is appended to `pans` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

The code snippet is:
```
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```
Based on the precondition, we can deduce the following:

* `mak` is 2 because the input string is '>'.
* `pans` is a list that contains `i` if `s` is '='. Since `s` is '=', `pans` contains `i` which is 3.
* `i` is 3.

Now, let's substitute these values into the code snippet:
```
print('?', pans[2], pans[2], pans[3], pans[3])
```
Since `pans` contains `i` which is 3, `pans[2]` is 3 and `pans[3]` is also 3.

Therefore, the output will be:
```
? 3 3 3 3
```
Output: **? 3 3 3 3**
