Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer contains the printed strings, and flushing it ensures that they are displayed immediately. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, `_`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged, as the code only affects the output buffer. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the flushed output buffer.
