Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, s is a string containing the input value, the output is cleared and contains the input value. If s is equal to '<', then mak is 1, pans is [1], and mak2 is not defined. If s is equal to '=', then pans is a list containing the integer 1, otherwise, pans is not defined. In all cases, mak and mak2 are not defined if s is not equal to '<'.***
