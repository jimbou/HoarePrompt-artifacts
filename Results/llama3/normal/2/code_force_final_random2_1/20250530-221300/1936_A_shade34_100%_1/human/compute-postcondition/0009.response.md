To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but we know that `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` is not empty and contains the string '<' if the input is '<', otherwise `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1**
