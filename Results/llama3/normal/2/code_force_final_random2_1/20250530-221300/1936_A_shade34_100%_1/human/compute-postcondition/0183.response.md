Postcondition: **The program's state after executing the if-else block is as follows: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `mak` is the last i for which the input is '<', `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last i for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing 0 if the input string `s` is '=', otherwise it remains an empty list, `s` is the input string, stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed. The output buffer is flushed, and the messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`. The program's state is updated accordingly based on whether the input string `s` is '=' or not.**
