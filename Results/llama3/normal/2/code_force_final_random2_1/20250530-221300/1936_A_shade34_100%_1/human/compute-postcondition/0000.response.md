The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0), `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
