Postcondition: **The program's state after executing the if-else block is as follows: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `mak` is 0 if the input string `s` is '<', otherwise it is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing 0 if the input string `s` is '=' or '<', otherwise it remains an empty list, `s` is the input string, stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`.**
