Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 0, mak is 0, _ is 2, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is [0], s is '<', stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [0] [0] [0] [0], where mak is 0, and i is 0, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [0] [mak2] [0] [mak2], where mak is 0, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', and i is 0, the output buffer is flushed.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 0, which is the current value of `i`. The list `pans` now contains the value 0, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
