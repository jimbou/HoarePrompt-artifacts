Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 2, _ is 2, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', s is the input string, stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of mak, mak2, and i. If the input string s is '<', then mak is 2, pans is a list containing 2. If the input string s is not '<', then mak is 1 if the input string s is '<', otherwise it is 0 if the input string s is '=' or '<', otherwise it is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list containing 1 if the input string s is '<', otherwise it contains 0 and then 2.**
