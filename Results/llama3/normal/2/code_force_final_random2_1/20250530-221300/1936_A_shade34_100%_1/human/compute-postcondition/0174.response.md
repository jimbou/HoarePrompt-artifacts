To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already an integer greater than or equal to 1, we don't need to adjust it. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure it is within the range of `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `mak` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], where `mak` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', and `i` is 0, and the output buffer is flushed.**
