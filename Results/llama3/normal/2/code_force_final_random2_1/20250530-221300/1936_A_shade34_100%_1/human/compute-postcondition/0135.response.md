Based on the given precondition, we can analyze the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`

From the precondition, we know:

* `mak` is 1 if the input string is '>' otherwise `mak` is 0.
* `i` is 2.
* `pans` is a list that must have at least 3 elements.
* If `s` is '=' then `pans` contains `i` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
* If `s` is '<' then `pans` is a list containing 0.
* If `s` is '=' then `pans` contains an additional element `i`.

Since the current value of `s` is '>' if the input string is '>' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', we can conclude that `s` is not equal to '<'. 

Also, since `s` is '=' if `s` is '=' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', we can conclude that `s` is '='.

Therefore, `pans` contains `i` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `pans` contains an additional element `i`.

Now, let's evaluate the print statement:

* `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 1, `pans[mak]` is `pans[1]`, which is `i` (since `pans` contains `i` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`).
* `pans[i]`: Since `i` is 2, `pans[i]` is `pans[2]`, which is also `i` (since `pans` contains `i` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`).

So, the print statement becomes: `print('?', i, i, i, i)`

Since `i` is 2, the output will be:

Output: **? 2 2 2 2**
