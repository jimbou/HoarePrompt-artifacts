To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state variables. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` should be 3 at the start of the next iteration. Similarly, `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other state variables (`mak`, `_`, `mak2`, `pans`, `stdin`, and the output buffer) are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is either 0, 1, or 2, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing all `i` for which the input is '=' or '<', `stdin` is either empty or contains a single '<' character, the output buffer is flushed, and the printed output remains the same**
