Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise it remains 0, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], where mak is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise it remains 0, and i is 2, and the output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer contains the strings "? 0 0 1 1" and "? [mak] [mak] [i] [i]", where mak is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise it remains 0, and i is 2. Therefore, these strings are printed to the output stream, and the output buffer is flushed. The values of the other variables are not affected.
