Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `mak` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], where mak is the last `i` for which the input is '<', and i is `n`, and the output buffer is flushed.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, which is the number of iterations. The value of `mak` will be the last index `i` for which the input was '<'. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer will be flushed, and the print statements will have been executed for each iteration, with the values of `mak` and `i` updated accordingly.
