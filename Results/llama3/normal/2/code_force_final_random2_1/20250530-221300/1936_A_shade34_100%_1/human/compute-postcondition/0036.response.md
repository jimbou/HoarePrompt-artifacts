Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is a string containing the input value, and the output is cleared. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 0, `pans` is a list containing a single element 0. If `s` is '=', then `pans` is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, no changes are made, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then the value of `mak2`, then the value of `i`, and finally the value of `mak2`**
