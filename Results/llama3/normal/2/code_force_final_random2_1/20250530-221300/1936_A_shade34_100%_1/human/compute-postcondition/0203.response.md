To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `pans`. The loop will execute if `pans` has at least 2 elements, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include the length of `pans`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `s` is the input string, `mak` is 0, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`.**
