Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, mak is the last i for which the input is '<', _ is 1, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list containing i if s is '=' otherwise pans is a list containing 0 if s is '<' otherwise pans is an empty list, and i is appended to pans, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each i from 2 to n-1: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each i from 1 to len(pans)-1: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], and s is '=' if s is '=' otherwise s is not equal to '<', and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], and s is the input string.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the value of `i` is appended to the list `pans`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
