To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already stated to be an integer greater than 0, we can focus on `i`. The loop starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`, so for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. Also, since `i` starts at 1, we can set `i` to 1 for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
