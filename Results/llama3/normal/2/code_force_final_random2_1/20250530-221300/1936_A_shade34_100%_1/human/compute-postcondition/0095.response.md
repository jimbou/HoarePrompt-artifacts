Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing all `i` for which the input is '=' or '<', `stdin` is either empty or contains a single '<' character, the output buffer is flushed, and the printed output remains the same. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 3 and the printed output is '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 3, followed by the value of `mak` which is 3, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, followed by the value of `i` which is 3. Otherwise, `mak` remains either 0, 1, or 2.**
