The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i`, and the value of `mak2` again.

Since `mak` is only defined when `s` is '<', its value is 0 in that case. If `s` is not '<', the value of `mak` is not specified in the precondition, so we can't determine its exact value.

Similarly, `mak2` is not defined in the precondition, so its value is also unknown.

The value of `i` is given as 1.

Therefore, the output will be a string containing a question mark, 0 (if `s` is '<'), an unknown value (if `s` is not '<'), 1, and the same unknown value again.

Output: **? 0 (if s is '<') or ? [unknown value] (if s is not '<'), 1, [unknown value]**
