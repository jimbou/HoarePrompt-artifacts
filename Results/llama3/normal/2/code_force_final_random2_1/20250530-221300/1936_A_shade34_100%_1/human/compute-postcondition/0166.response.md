To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but we know it must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, such as `mak`, `_`, `mak2`, `pans`, `s`, `stdin`, and the output buffer, are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is 2 if the input is '<', otherwise it remains 1, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, and the output buffer is flushed.**
