The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`. 

`mak` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `mak2` is also the last `i` for which the input is '<', and `i` is 1. 

Since `mak` and `mak2` are the last `i` for which the input is '<', and `s` is '=' if `s` is '=' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', it means that `s` is not equal to '<'. 

Therefore, `mak` and `mak2` are the last `i` for which the input is '<', which is not the current input. 

So, `mak` and `mak2` are the same as the previous `i` for which the input is '<', which is 1.

Output: **? 1 1 1 1**
