Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, `_` is 0, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed. The current value of the input is '>'.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
