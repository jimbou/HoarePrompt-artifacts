The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise it remains 0, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the output buffer is flushed.**
