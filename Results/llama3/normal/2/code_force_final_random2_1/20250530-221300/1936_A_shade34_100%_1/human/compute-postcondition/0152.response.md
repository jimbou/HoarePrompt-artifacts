Output State: **n is an integer equal to the input value, mak is 0, i is len(pans), _ is 2, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list that must have at least len(pans) elements, s is the input string, stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin is not empty, it now contains no input. The second line assigns 0 to `mak`. No other variables are affected. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
