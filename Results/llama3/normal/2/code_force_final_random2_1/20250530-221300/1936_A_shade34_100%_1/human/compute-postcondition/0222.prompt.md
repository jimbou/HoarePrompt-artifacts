Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `s` is the input string, `mak` is 0, `pans` is a list containing `n-1` if `s` is '<', otherwise it contains `n-2` if `s` is '<', otherwise it contains `n-3` and then `n-1`, stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]), and the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]). If the input is '>', then `s` is '>', `mak` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is the input string and `mak` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing at least 3 elements, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]), and the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]). If the input is '>', then `s` is '>', `mak` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is the input string and `mak` is 0, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]), and the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]). The output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing at least 4 elements, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]), and the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]). If the input is '>', then `s` is '>', `mak` is 1, and `mak` is equal to `i` which is 3. Otherwise, `s` is the input string and `mak` is 0, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]), and the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]). The output buffer is flushed, and '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (pans[mak]), the first element of the list `pans` (pans[mak]), the third element of the list `pans` (pans[i]), and the third element of the list `pans` (pans[i]) is printed, and the output buffer is flushed again.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
