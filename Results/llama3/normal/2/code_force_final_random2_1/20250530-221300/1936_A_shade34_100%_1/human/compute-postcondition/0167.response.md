The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak` repeated twice, and the value of `i` repeated twice.
Since `mak` is 2 if the input is '<', otherwise it remains 1, and `i` is 3, the print statement will output the string with the actual values of `mak` and `i`.
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where mak is 2 if the input is '<', otherwise it is 1)**
