Based on the precondition, the code prints a string with a question mark, followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`. The value of `mak` depends on the input: if the input is '<', then `mak` is 2; otherwise, `mak` is 1. The value of `i` is 3.

Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `mak`. However, we can describe the possible outputs based on the input.

If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, and the output will be:
Output: **? 2 2 3 3**

If the input is not '<', then `mak` is 1, and the output will be:
Output: **? 1 1 3 3**

Note that the output buffer is flushed before and after printing, but this does not affect the output itself.
