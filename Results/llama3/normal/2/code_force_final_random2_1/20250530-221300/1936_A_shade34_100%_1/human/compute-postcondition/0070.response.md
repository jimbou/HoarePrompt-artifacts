Postcondition: **The program executes as follows: if the input is '> ', then the program prints a series of strings in a specific format, including '? 0 0 1 1' and '? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i]' for each 'i' from 2 to 'n-1', and finally '? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]', with the output buffer flushed after each print. If the input is not '> ', the program does nothing. In either case, 'n' remains an integer greater than 0, 'i' remains 3, and 'pans' remains a list containing at least 3 elements.**
