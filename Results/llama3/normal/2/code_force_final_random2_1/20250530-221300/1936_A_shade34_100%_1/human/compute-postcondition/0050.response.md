Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, i is n, mak is the last i for which the input is '<', _ is 0, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list containing all i for which the input is '=' or '<', stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each i from 2 to n-1: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
* The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
* The value of `mak` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<'. If all inputs were '<', then `mak` is `n-1`.
* The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
* The value of `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<'. If all inputs were '<', then `mak2` is `n-1`.
* The list `pans` contains all indices `i` for which the input was '=' or '<'.
* The `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input has been processed.
* The output buffer is flushed, indicating that all output has been printed.
* The output includes the initial print statement `? 0 0 1 1`, followed by print statements for each `i` from 2 to `n-1` in the format `? [mak] [mak] [i] [i]`.
