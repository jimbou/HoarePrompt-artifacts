Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, s is a string containing the new input value, the output is cleared and contains the new input value, the value '?' is printed, mak is 2, mak2 is not defined, pans is [2]**.

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 2. The string `s` still contains the new input value. The output is cleared and contains the new input value, and the value '?' is printed. The value of `mak` is now 2, which is assigned from the value of `i`. The value of `mak2` remains not defined as it is not affected by the code. The list `pans` is initialized with the value of `i`, which is 2.
