Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0). Then for each test case, stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 1).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mak` is `len(pans)-1`, `_` is 0, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing all `i` for which the input is '=' or '<', stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `len(pans)`, `mak` is `len(pans)-1` if the input string is '>' otherwise `mak` is `len(pans)-2`, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `pans` contains `i` if `s` is '=' otherwise `pans` is a list containing 0 if `s` is '<' otherwise `pans` is an empty list, and if `s` is '=' then `i` is appended to `pans` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? `[mak2]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! `[mak2]` `[pans[mak]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and `s` is '=' if `s` is '=' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and `s` is the input string. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 0 and `pans` is a list containing 0. If `s` is '=', then `pans` contains an additional element `i`, and this is printed: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed. The current value of `s` is '>' if the input string is '>' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<'. and this is printed: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed. The program has finished iterating over the `pans` list and has updated the `mak` variable based on the input string. The `i` variable has reached the end of the `pans` list, and the program has printed all the necessary patterns with `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` values. The output buffer has been flushed after each print statement, and the program has updated the `pans` list based on the input string. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged, and this is printed: ! `[mak2]` `[pans[mak]]`, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `len(pans)-1`, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing at least `len(pans)` elements, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`. If the input is '>', then `s` is '>', `mak` is `len(pans)-1`. Otherwise, `s` is the input string and `mak` is 0. and this is printed: '!' followed by the last index for which the input is '<' which is `mak2` and the last element of the list `pans` which is `pans[mak]` and the output buffer is flushed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
