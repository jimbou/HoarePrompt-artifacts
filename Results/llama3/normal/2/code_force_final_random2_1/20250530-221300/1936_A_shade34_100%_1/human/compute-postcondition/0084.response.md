The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing all `i` for which the input is '=' or '<', `stdin` is either empty or contains a single '<' character, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and the current value of the input is either '<' or empty.**
