Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 3 and `_` is 0. Otherwise, `mak` is 1 and `_` is 0.***
