Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is either 0, 1, or 2, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing all `i` for which the input is '=' or '<', `stdin` is either empty or contains a single '<' character, the output buffer is flushed, and the printed output remains the same, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0, 1, or 2, followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0, 1, or 2, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, followed by the value of `i` which is 3.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer contains the string '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0, 1, or 2), followed by the value of `mak` again, followed by the value of `i` (which is 3), followed by the value of `i` again. This output is now printed to the output stream. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, `_`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged, as does the state of the `stdin`.
