Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], where mak is 2 and i is 2, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mak` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the previously printed values, and the program state remains the same except for the updated value of `mak`.
