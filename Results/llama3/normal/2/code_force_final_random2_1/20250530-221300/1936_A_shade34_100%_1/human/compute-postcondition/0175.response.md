The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`. 

`mak` is the last `i` for which the input is '<'. Since `i` is 0 and there is no input in `stdin`, `mak` is also 0.

`mak2` is also the last `i` for which the input is '<'. Since `i` is 0 and there is no input in `stdin`, `mak2` is also 0.

`i` is 0.

The output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], where `mak` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', and `i` is 0, and the output buffer is flushed.

Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
