Based on the precondition, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`

Here's what we know about the variables:

* `pans` is a list that must have at least 2 elements.
* `mak` is 0.
* `i` is 1.

Since `mak` is 0, `pans[mak]` refers to the first element of the `pans` list. Since `i` is 1, `pans[i]` refers to the second element of the `pans` list.

The print statement will output a string that starts with '?' followed by the values of `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `pans[i]`, and `pans[i]`.

Since `s` is '=' if `s` is '=' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', we can infer that `s` is either '=' or not '<'. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 0 and `pans` is a list containing 0. If `s` is '=', then `pans` contains an additional element `i`.

However, we don't know the exact value of `s` or the contents of the `pans` list. Therefore, we can't determine the exact values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`.

Output: **? [first element of pans] [first element of pans] [second element of pans] [second element of pans]**
