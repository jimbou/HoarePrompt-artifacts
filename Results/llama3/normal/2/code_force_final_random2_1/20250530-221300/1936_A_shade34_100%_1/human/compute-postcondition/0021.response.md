Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mak` is `n-1` if all inputs are '<', otherwise `mak` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to `n`, `mak` is equal to `n-1` if all inputs are '<', otherwise it is the last `i` for which the input is '<', the variable `_` remains 0, `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the loop has printed the required strings for each iteration.
