According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer greater than 0 and i is n, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, mak is the last i for which the input is '<', _ is 1, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is an empty list, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each i from 2 to n-1: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each i from 1 to len(pans)-1: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.**
