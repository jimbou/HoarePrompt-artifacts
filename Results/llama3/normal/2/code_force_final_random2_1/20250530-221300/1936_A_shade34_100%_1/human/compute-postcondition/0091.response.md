Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `mak` is either 0, 1, or 2, so it will print one of these values.
* `i` is 3, so it will print 3.
* The `?` is a literal character that will be printed as is.

Therefore, the output will be a string that starts with `?`, followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0, 1, or 2), another `mak` (which is the same value as the first one), the value of `i` (which is 3), and another `i` (which is also 3).

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where [mak] is either 0, 1, or 2)**
