Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `mak` is 2, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]), and the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]). If the input is '>', then `s` is '>', `mak` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is the input string and `mak` is 0, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]), and the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]). The output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `mak` has been updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
