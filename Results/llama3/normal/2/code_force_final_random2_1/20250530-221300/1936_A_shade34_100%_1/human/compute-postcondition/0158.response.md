Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `s` is the input string, `stdin` contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the output buffer is flushed. The current value of the input is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer is still flushed, and the printed output remains the same. The input string `s` and the current input value '<' also remain unchanged.
