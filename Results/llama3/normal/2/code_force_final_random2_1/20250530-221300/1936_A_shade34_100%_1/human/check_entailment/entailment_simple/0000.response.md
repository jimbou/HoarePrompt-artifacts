Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized. The program uses a series of queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of numbers in the secret sequence and finds the maximum value. It then uses another series of queries to find the pair of numbers that produces this maximum value when their bitwise XOR is calculated.

The program correctly handles the input and output operations, flushing the output buffer after each query and the final answer. It also correctly implements the required logic to find the maximum value and the corresponding pair of indices.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the secret sequence, which is within the allowed limit of 3n queries.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
