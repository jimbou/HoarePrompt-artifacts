Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2 and `_` is 0. Otherwise, `mak` is 1 and `_` is 0., and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], where i is 3 and mak is either 1 or 2 depending on the input, and the output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. However, since the output buffer is already flushed in the initial state, this code does not change the output state. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, and `_` remain the same, and the output buffer remains flushed. The printed output also remains the same.
