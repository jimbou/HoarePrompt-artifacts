Postcondition: **The program's output and variables are updated based on the input string. If the input string is '>', then `mak` is set to 3, and the program prints specific patterns with `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` values. If the input string is not '>', then `mak` is set to 2 if the input string is '=' and 1 otherwise. The program also updates the `pans` list based on the input string, and prints specific patterns with `pans` and `i` values. The output buffer is flushed after each print statement.**
