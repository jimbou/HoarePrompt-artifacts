Output: ** `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `len(pans)`, `mak` is `len(pans)-1` if the input string is '>' otherwise `mak` is `len(pans)-2`, `_` is 1, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `pans` contains `i` if `s` is '=' otherwise `pans` is a list containing 0 if `s` is '<' otherwise `pans` is an empty list, and if `s` is '=' then `i` is appended to `pans` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? `[mak2]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each `i` from 1 to `len(pans)-1`: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! `[mak2]` `[pans[mak]]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak]` `[i]` `[i]`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and `s` is '=' if `s` is '=' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', and this is printed: ? `[mak]` `[mak2]` `[i]` `[mak2]`, and `s` is the input string. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 0 and `pans` is a list containing 0. If `s` is '=', then `pans` contains an additional element `i`, and this is printed: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed. The current value of `s` is '>' if the input string is '>' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<'. and this is printed: ? `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[mak]]` `[pans[i]]` `[pans[i]]`, and the output buffer is flushed. The program has finished iterating over the `pans` list and has updated the `mak` variable based on the input string. The `i` variable has reached the end of the `pans` list, and the program has printed all the necessary patterns with `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` values. The output buffer has been flushed after each print statement, and the program has updated the `pans` list based on the input string. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged, and this is printed: ! `[mak2]` `[pans[mak]]`**
