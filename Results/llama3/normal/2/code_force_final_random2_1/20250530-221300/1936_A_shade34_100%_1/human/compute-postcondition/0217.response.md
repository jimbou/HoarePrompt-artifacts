The code prints a string containing a '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]) repeated twice, the third element of the list `pans` (pans[2]) repeated twice.
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the list pans and pans[2] is the third element of the list pans)**
