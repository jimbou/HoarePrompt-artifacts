Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty if the input is '<', otherwise `stdin` is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed: ? [2] [2] [2] [2], and the output buffer is flushed.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer is still flushed, and the printed messages remain the same, but the values of `[mak]` have been updated to 2.
