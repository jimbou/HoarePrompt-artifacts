Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, i is n, _ is 2, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', s is the input string, stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of mak, mak2, and i. If the input string s is '<', then mak is n-1, pans is a list containing n-1. If the input string s is not '<', then mak is n-2 if the input string s is '<', otherwise it is n-3 if the input string s is '=' or '<', otherwise it is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list containing n-2 if the input string s is '<', otherwise it contains n-3 and then n-1.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the final values of the variables are determined based on the input string `s`. The value of `mak` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, depending on whether the input string `s` is '<' or not. The list `pans` contains either `n-1` or `n-2` and `n-1`, depending on the input string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
