Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each `i` from 2 to `n-1`: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed. If the input is '>', then `mak` is 1 and `_` is 0. Otherwise, `mak` and `_` remain unchanged.***
