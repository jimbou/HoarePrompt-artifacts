Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `s` is '>', `mak` is 1, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the first element of the list `pans` (pans[0]), the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]), and the second element of the list `pans` (pans[1]).**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer is still flushed, and the specified messages are still printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`. The input string `s` is still '>', and the list `pans` still contains at least 2 elements.
