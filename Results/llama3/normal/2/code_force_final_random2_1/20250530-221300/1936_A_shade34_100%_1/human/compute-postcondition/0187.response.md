The code prints a string containing the character '?', the value of `mak` which is 0 if the input string `s` is '<', otherwise it is the last `i` for which the input is '<', the value of `mak2` which is the last `i` for which the input is '<', the value of `i` which is 1, and the value of `mak2` which is the last `i` for which the input is '<'.

Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0 if the input string `s` is '<', otherwise it is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing 0 if the input string `s` is '=' or '<', otherwise it remains an empty list, `s` is the input string, stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`, and this is printed: "? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2]"**
