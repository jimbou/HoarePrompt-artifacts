To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for i in range(n):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0 if the input string `s` is '<', otherwise it is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `pans` is a list containing 0 if the input string `s` is '=' or '<', otherwise it remains an empty list, `s` is the input string, stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`.**
