Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 1, mak is 1, _ is 2, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list containing 1, s is the input string, stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of mak, mak2, and i, and this is printed: "? [1] [mak2] [1] [mak2]"**

In this final state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The list `pans` now contains the value 1, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer is still flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the updated values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`.
