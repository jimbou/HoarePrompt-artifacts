Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `_` is 2, `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<', `s` is the input string, `mak` is 0, `pans` is a list containing `n-1` if `s` is '<', otherwise it contains `n-2` if `s` is '<', otherwise it contains `n-3` and then `n-1`, stdin contains no input, the output buffer is flushed, and the specified messages are printed with the correct values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `pans` depends on the input string `s`. If `s` is '<', then `pans` contains `n-1`. If `s` is not '<', then `pans` contains `n-2` if `s` is '<', otherwise it contains `n-3` and then `n-1`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
