Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print('!', mak2, pans[mak])`

From the precondition, we know that:

* `mak2` is the last `i` for which the input is '<'. Since the current value of `s` is '>' if the input string is '>' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', we can conclude that `mak2` is not the last `i` for which the input is '<' because `s` is not '<'. Therefore, `mak2` is not updated and remains as its initial value, which is not explicitly stated in the precondition. However, based on the context, we can assume that `mak2` is an index value.
* `mak` is `len(pans)-1` if the input string is '>' otherwise `mak` is `len(pans)-2`. Since the current value of `s` is '>' if the input string is '>' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', we can conclude that `mak` is `len(pans)-1`.
* `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements. If `s` is '=' then `i` is appended to `pans` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Since `s` is '=' if `s` is '=' otherwise `s` is not equal to '<', we can conclude that `pans` contains `i` values from 0 to `n-1`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('!', mak2, pans[mak])`

* `!` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `mak2` is an index value, but its exact value is not explicitly stated in the precondition. However, based on the context, we can assume that `mak2` is an index value that refers to an element in the `pans` list.
* `pans[mak]` is an element in the `pans` list at index `mak`. Since `mak` is `len(pans)-1`, `pans[mak]` refers to the last element in the `pans` list.

Therefore, the print statement will print:

* The literal string `!`
* The value of `mak2`, which is an index value that refers to an element in the `pans` list
* The last element in the `pans` list, which is `pans[len(pans)-1]`

Output: **! [mak2] [pans[len(pans)-1]]**
