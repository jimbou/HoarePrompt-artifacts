The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, mak is 0, _ is 1, mak2 is the last i for which the input is '<', pans is a list containing all i for which the input is '=' or '<', stdin is empty, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed for each i from 2 to n-1: ? [mak2] [mak2] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed for each i from 1 to len(pans)-1: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [pans[mak]]**
