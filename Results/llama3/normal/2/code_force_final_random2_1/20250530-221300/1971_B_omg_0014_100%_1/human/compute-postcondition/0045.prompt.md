You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is n-1, stdin is empty, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters. If a contains exactly one unique lowercase English letter, 'NO' is printed. If a contains more than one unique lowercase English letter, 'YES' is printed. If the characters in s are in ascending order, the string c which is the characters of s in descending order is printed. Otherwise, the string b which is the characters of s in ascending order is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is n-1, stdin is empty, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters. If a contains exactly one unique lowercase English letter, 'NO' is printed. If a contains more than one unique lowercase English letter, 'YES' is printed. If the characters in s are in ascending order, the string c which is the characters of s in descending order is printed. Otherwise, the string b which is the characters of s in ascending order is printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
