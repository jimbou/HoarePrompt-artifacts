This function reads a series of strings from standard input, checks if each string contains more than one unique character, and prints 'YES' if it does, followed by the string sorted in ascending order unless it's already sorted, in which case it prints the string sorted in descending order. If a string contains only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. The function processes a number of strings specified by an initial integer input.
