Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 2, stdin contains n-4 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters, 'YES' is being printed, b is a string consisting of the characters of s in ascending order, c is a string consisting of the characters of s in descending order**

The code snippet sorts the characters in string `s` in ascending and descending order, assigning the results to variables `b` and `c`, respectively. The rest of the variables and the input in stdin remain unchanged.
