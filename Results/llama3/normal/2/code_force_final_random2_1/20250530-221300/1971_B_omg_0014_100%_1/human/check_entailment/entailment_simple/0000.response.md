Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly solves the problem by checking if the input string has more than one unique character. If it does, it prints "YES" and then prints the characters of the string in either ascending or descending order, depending on the original order of the characters. If the string has only one unique character, it prints "NO".

The program uses a set to efficiently check for unique characters in the string, and it uses the built-in sorted function to sort the characters in ascending and descending order. The program also correctly handles the case where the input string is already in ascending order, in which case it prints the characters in descending order.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
