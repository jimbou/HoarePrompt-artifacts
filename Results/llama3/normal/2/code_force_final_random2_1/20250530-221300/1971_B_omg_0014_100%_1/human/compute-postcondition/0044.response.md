Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is n-1, stdin is empty, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters. If a contains exactly one unique lowercase English letter, 'NO' is printed. If a contains more than one unique lowercase English letter, 'YES' is printed. If the characters in s are in ascending order, the string c which is the characters of s in descending order is printed. Otherwise, the string b which is the characters of s in ascending order is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now `n-1`. The standard input (`stdin`) is empty, as all the strings have been read. The string `s` and the set `a` still contain the last string and its unique characters, respectively. The output will be either 'NO' if the last string contains only one unique character, or 'YES' followed by the sorted string in ascending or descending order, depending on whether the last string was already sorted.
