Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly handles all possible cases. It first checks if the length of the set of characters in the string is 1, which means all characters are the same. If so, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to the original string.

If the length of the set of characters is more than 1, it prints 'YES' and then checks if the sorted string is equal to the original string. If so, it prints the reverse sorted string. Otherwise, it prints the sorted string. This ensures that the rearranged string is always different from the original string.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including strings with all the same characters, strings with only two distinct characters, and strings with more than two distinct characters. It also correctly handles strings of length 1, where it's impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to the original string.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
