The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 1, stdin contains n-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters. If a contains exactly one unique lowercase English letter, 'NO' is printed. If a contains more than one unique lowercase English letter, 'YES' is printed. If the characters in s are in ascending order, the string c which is the characters of s in descending order is printed. Otherwise, the string b which is the characters of s in ascending order is printed.**
