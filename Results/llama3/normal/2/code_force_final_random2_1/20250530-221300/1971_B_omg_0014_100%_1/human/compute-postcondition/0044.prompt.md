Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains n strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is 0, stdin contains n-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters. If a contains exactly one unique lowercase English letter, 'NO' is printed. If a contains more than one unique lowercase English letter, 'YES' is printed. If the characters in s are in ascending order, the string c which is the characters of s in descending order is printed. Otherwise, the string b which is the characters of s in ascending order is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 1, stdin contains n-2 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters. If a contains exactly one unique lowercase English letter, 'NO' is printed. If a contains more than one unique lowercase English letter, 'YES' is printed. If the characters in s are in ascending order, the string c which is the characters of s in descending order is printed. Otherwise, the string b which is the characters of s in ascending order is printed. If a contains exactly one unique lowercase English letter, 'NO' is printed. If a contains more than one unique lowercase English letter, the characters of s in ascending or descending order are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 2, stdin contains n-4 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters. If the size of set a is 1, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed. If the string s is already in ascending order, the string c (which is the string s in descending order) is being printed. Otherwise, the string b (which is the string s with characters in ascending order) is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
