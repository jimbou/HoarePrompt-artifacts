Based on the precondition, the variable `b` is a string consisting of the characters of `s` in ascending order. Since `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10, the characters in `b` will be the same characters as in `s`, but arranged in alphabetical order.

Output: **the characters of s in ascending order**
