The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which ensures that the loop will execute, so `n` does not need to be adjusted. However, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0, which is the initial value of the loop counter.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, stdin contains n strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10**
