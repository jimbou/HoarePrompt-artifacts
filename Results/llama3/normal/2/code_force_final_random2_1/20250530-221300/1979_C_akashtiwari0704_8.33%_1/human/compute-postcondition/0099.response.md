Postcondition: **t is at least 2, T is 2, i is either bets - 1 or bets, sumo is the original value of sumo plus the sum of the integer divisions of prod by the original value of a[i] for all i in range(bets), prod is the product of all elements in a except the ith element, a is a list of integers where the ith element is the integer division of prod by the new value of a[i], bets is an integer, stdin is empty. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, a string containing the ith element of a followed by a space, repeated bets times, is printed.**
