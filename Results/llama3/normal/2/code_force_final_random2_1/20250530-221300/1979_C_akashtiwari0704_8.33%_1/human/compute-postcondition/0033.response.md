The only variable in the loop head is variable T, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T and t. If T is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is 0 and t is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, T must be increased by 1.
State: **t is at least 1, T is 1, bets is an integer, a is a list of integers where a[i] is prod // a[i] for all i in range(bets), prod is the product of the first bets elements of a, i is bets-1 if sumo is greater than or equal to prod, otherwise i is bets, sumo is the original sumo plus the sum of prod // a[i] for all i in range(bets). If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, a string containing all elements of a followed by a space is printed.**
