Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a`, `bets` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is such that `sumo` has been reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. `t` is still at least 2, `T` remains 2, `i` is still `bets - 1`, `stdin` is still empty, `prod` is still the product of all elements in `a`, and `bets` and `a` retain their original values.
