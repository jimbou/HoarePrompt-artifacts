Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `i` is 1, `sumo` is the original value of `sumo` plus the sum of the integer divisions of `prod` by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`bets`), `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` except the `i`th element, `a` is a list of integers where the `i`th element is the integer division of `prod` by the new value of `a[i]`, `bets` is an integer greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is a string containing the `i`th element of `a` followed by a space, and then another space and the `i`th element of `a` again.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the string `ans` now contains an additional space and the `i`th element of `a` again. All other variables remain unchanged.
