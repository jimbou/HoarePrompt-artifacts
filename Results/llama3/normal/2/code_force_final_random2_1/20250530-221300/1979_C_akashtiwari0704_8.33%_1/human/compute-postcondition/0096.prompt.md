Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the original value of `sumo` plus the sum of the integer divisions of `prod` by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`bets`), `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` except the `i`th element, `a` is a list of integers where the `i`th element is the integer division of `prod` by the new value of `a[i]`, `bets` is an integer, `stdin` is empty, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `i` is 0, `sumo` is the original value of `sumo` plus the sum of the integer divisions of `prod` by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`bets`), `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` except the `i`th element, `a` is a list of integers where the `i`th element is the integer division of `prod` by the new value of `a[i]`, `bets` is an integer greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is a string containing the `i`th element of `a` followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `i` is 1, `sumo` is the original value of `sumo` plus the sum of the integer divisions of `prod` by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`bets`), `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` except the `i`th element, `a` is a list of integers where the `i`th element is the integer division of `prod` by the new value of `a[i]`, `bets` is an integer greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is a string containing the `i`th element of `a` followed by a space, and then another space and the `i`th element of `a` again.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `i` is 2, `sumo` is the original value of `sumo` plus the sum of the integer divisions of `prod` by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range(`bets`), `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` except the `i`th element, `a` is a list of integers where the `i`th element is the integer division of `prod` by the new value of `a[i]`, `bets` is an integer greater than 2, `stdin` is empty, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is a string containing the `i`th element of `a` followed by a space, and then another space and the `i`th element of `a` again, and then another space and the `i`th element of `a` again.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
