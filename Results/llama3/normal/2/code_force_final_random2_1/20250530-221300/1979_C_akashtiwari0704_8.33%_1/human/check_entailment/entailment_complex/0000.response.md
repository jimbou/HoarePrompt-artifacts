Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program calculates the product of all multipliers, then for each multiplier, it calculates the product of all other multipliers and assigns this value as the bet for that outcome. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program also correctly handles the case where it is not possible to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome, in which case it prints -1.

Correctness: **True**
