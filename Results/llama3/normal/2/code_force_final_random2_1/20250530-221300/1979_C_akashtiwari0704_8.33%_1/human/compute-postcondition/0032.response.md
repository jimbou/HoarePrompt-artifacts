Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, T is 0, bets is an integer, a is a list of integers where a[i] is prod // a[i] for all i in range(bets), prod is the product of the first bets elements of a, i is bets-1 if sumo is greater than or equal to prod, otherwise i is bets, sumo is the original sumo plus the sum of prod // a[i] for all i in range(bets). If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, a string containing all elements of a followed by a space is printed.***
