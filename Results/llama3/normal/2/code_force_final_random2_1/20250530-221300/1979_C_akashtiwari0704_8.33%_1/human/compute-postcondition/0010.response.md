Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, `bets` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is `bets-1`, `sumo` is 0**

In this output state, a new variable `sumo` has been introduced and assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `sumo` is now part of the program state, with an initial value of 0.
