Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game, such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a` for each outcome.

3. It calculates the product `prod` of all multipliers `a[i]`. This product represents the total amount of coins that would be received back if all outcomes were winning.

4. It then calculates the sum `sumo` of the amounts that would be bet on each outcome. The amount bet on each outcome is calculated as `prod // a[i]`, which is the product of all multipliers except the current one.

5. If the sum `sumo` is greater than or equal to the product `prod`, it means that there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and the program prints `-1`.

6. Otherwise, it constructs a string `ans` containing the amounts to be bet on each outcome and prints it.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there is a potential issue with the program. The product `prod` of all multipliers `a[i]` can be very large and may exceed the maximum limit of an integer in Python. This could lead to an overflow error.

To fix this issue, the program could use a more efficient method to calculate the amounts to be bet on each outcome, without calculating the product of all multipliers.

Correctness: **False**
