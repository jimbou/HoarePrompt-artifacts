You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, …, k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = 1
        
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: t is 0, T is t, bets is an integer, a is a list of integers where the ith element is the integer division of prod by the new value of a[i], prod is the product of all elements in a except the ith element, i is bets - 1, sumo is the original value of sumo plus the sum of the integer divisions of prod by the original value of a[i] for all i in range(bets), stdin is empty. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, a string containing the ith element of a followed by a space, repeated bets times, is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: t is 0, T is t, bets is an integer, a is a list of integers where the ith element is the integer division of prod by the new value of a[i], prod is the product of all elements in a except the ith element, i is bets - 1, sumo is the original value of sumo plus the sum of the integer divisions of prod by the original value of a[i] for all i in range(bets), stdin is empty. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, a string containing the ith element of a followed by a space, repeated bets times, is printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
