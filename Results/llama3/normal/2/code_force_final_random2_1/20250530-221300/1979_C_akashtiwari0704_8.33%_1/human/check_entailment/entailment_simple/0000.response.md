Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of outcomes, and the multipliers for each outcome as input.

The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then for each outcome, it calculates the bet amount as the product divided by the multiplier for that outcome. It then checks if the sum of all bet amounts is less than the product. If it is, the program prints the bet amounts for each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program's logic is correct. It ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome, which is the condition for coming out ahead in the game.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The product of all multipliers can be very large, and the program may exceed the maximum limit for integers in Python. But since the problem statement guarantees that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the maximum value of each multiplier is 20, the product will not exceed the maximum limit for integers in Python.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
