The code prints the string `ans` which is a concatenation of the `i`th element of `a` followed by a space, repeated `bets` times. Since `a` is a list of integers where the `i`th element is the integer division of `prod` by the new value of `a[i]`, and `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` except the `i`th element, the `i`th element of `a` is essentially the integer division of `prod` by itself, which is 1.

Therefore, the string `ans` is a concatenation of the string "1 " repeated `bets` times.

Output: **1 1 ... 1 (where there are `bets` number of 1's)**
