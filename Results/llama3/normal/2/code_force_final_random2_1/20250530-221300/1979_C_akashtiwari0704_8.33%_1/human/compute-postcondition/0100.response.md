Output State: **t is 0, T is t, bets is an integer, a is a list of integers where the ith element is the integer division of prod by the new value of a[i], prod is the product of all elements in a except the ith element, i is bets - 1, sumo is the original value of sumo plus the sum of the integer divisions of prod by the original value of a[i] for all i in range(bets), stdin is empty. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, a string containing the ith element of a followed by a space, repeated bets times, is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` has been decremented to 0, and the variable `T` has reached its final value, which is the initial value of `t`. The variable `bets` remains an integer, and the list `a` has been modified such that each element is the integer division of the product of all other elements in `a` divided by the original value at that index. The variable `prod` is the product of all elements in `a` except the ith element, and the variable `i` is either `bets - 1` or `bets`. The variable `sumo` is the sum of all elements in `a` plus the sum of the original values of all elements in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, a string containing all elements of `a` as strings separated by spaces is printed. The standard input `stdin` is empty after all iterations.
