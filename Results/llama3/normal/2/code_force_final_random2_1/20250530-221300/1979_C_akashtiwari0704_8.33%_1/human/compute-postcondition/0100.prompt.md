Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = 1
    for i in range(bets):
        prod *= a[i]
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, T is 0, bets is an integer, a is a list of integers where a[i] is prod // a[i] for all i in range(bets), prod is the product of the first bets elements of a, i is bets-1 if sumo is greater than or equal to prod, otherwise i is bets, sumo is the original sumo plus the sum of prod // a[i] for all i in range(bets). If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, a string containing all elements of a followed by a space is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 1, T is 1, bets is an integer, a is a list of integers with each element replaced by the product of all other elements in a divided by the original value at that index, prod is the product of all elements in a, stdin is empty, i is bets - 1, sumo is the sum of all elements in a plus the sum of the original values of all elements in a. If the current value of sumo is greater than or equal to the current value of prod, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the string ans containing all elements of a as strings separated by spaces is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 2, T is 2, i is either bets - 1 or bets, sumo is the original value of sumo plus the sum of the integer divisions of prod by the original value of a[i] for all i in range(bets), prod is the product of all elements in a except the ith element, a is a list of integers where the ith element is the integer division of prod by the new value of a[i], bets is an integer, stdin is empty. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, a string containing the ith element of a followed by a space, repeated bets times, is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
