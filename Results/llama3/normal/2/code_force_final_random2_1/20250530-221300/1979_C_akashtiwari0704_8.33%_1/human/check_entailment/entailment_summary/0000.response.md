Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program calculates the product of all multipliers (k_i) for each test case. Then, for each multiplier, it calculates the product of all other multipliers and assigns this value as the bet for that outcome. The sum of all bets is then compared to the product of all multipliers.

If the sum of bets is greater than or equal to the product of all multipliers, it means that there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and the program prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the calculated bets for each outcome.

The program's logic is correct because it ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. This is achieved by assigning the product of all other multipliers as the bet for each outcome, which guarantees that the sum of bets is less than the product of all multipliers.

Correctness: **True**
