Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is a list of multipliers that are not pairwise coprime. In such cases, the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers may not be equal to their product, and the program's calculation of the bets based on the product of the multipliers will be incorrect.

For example, if the input is [2, 4, 6], the program will calculate the product as 48 and the bets as [24, 12, 8]. However, the LCM of [2, 4, 6] is 12, not 48, and the correct bets would be [6, 3, 2]. The program's output will not satisfy the condition that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
