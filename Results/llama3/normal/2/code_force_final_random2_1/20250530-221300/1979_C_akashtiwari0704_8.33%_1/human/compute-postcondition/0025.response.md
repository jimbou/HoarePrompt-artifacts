State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, `bets` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in range(`bets`), `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is 1, `sumo` is the original `sumo` plus the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in range(`bets`), `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is a string containing the first element of `a` followed by a space**
