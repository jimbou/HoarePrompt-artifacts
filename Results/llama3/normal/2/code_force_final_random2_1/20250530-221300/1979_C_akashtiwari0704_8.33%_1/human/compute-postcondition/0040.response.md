The value of `prod` is updated by multiplying it with `a[i]`, where `i` is 2. The initial value of `prod` is `a[0] * a[1]`, so the new value of `prod` is `(a[0] * a[1]) * a[2]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 1, `bets` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is `(a[0] * a[1]) * a[2]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2**
