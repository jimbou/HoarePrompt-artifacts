The code prints a string containing all elements of the list `a` as strings separated by spaces. The elements of `a` are the product of all other elements in `a` divided by the original value at that index.

Output: **a string containing all elements of the list a as strings separated by spaces (where each element of a is the product of all other elements in a divided by the original value at that index)**
