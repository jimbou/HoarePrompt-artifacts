Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1, `T` is 1, `bets` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with each element replaced by the product of all other elements in `a` divided by the original value at that index, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in `a` plus the sum of the original values of all elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty string, and the sum of all elements in `a` plus the sum of the original values of all elements in `a` is less than the product of all elements in `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `T` is 1, `bets` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers with each element replaced by the product of all other elements in `a` divided by the original value at that index, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a`, `i` is 0, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in `a` plus the sum of the original values of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a string containing the first element of `a` as a string followed by a space, and the sum of all elements in `a` plus the sum of the original values of all elements in `a` is less than the product of all elements in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1, `T` is 1, `bets` is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers with each element replaced by the product of all other elements in `a` divided by the original value at that index, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a`, `i` is 1, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in `a` plus the sum of the original values of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a string containing the first two elements of `a` as strings separated by spaces, and the sum of all elements in `a` plus the sum of the original values of all elements in `a` is less than the product of all elements in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1, `T` is 1, `bets` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers with each element replaced by the product of all other elements in `a` divided by the original value at that index, `prod` is the product of all elements in `a`, `i` is 2, `sumo` is the sum of all elements in `a` plus the sum of the original values of all elements in `a`, and `ans` is a string containing the first three elements of `a` as strings separated by spaces, and the sum of all elements in `a` plus the sum of the original values of all elements in `a` is less than the product of all elements in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
