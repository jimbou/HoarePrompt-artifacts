Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of bets and a list of integers. It calculates the product of all integers in each test case, then for each integer, it calculates the product of all other integers and adds this to a sum. If the sum is greater than or equal to the product, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints a string containing the calculated products for each integer, separated by spaces.**
