To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `bets`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `bets`. If `bets` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, `bets` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is 1, `i` is 0**
