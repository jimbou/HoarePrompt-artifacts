Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s` and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` plus two if `c` is 1, `ans` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` times the number of zeroes in the list `s` plus one if the number of ones in the list `s` plus two if `c` is 1 is greater than 0 and `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` times the number of zeroes in the list `s` plus the difference between the number of zeroes in the list `s` and the number of zeroes in the list `s`, stdin contains `n-5` lines, each containing a binary string.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[c]` has been incremented by 1, which means that if `c` is 1, the number of ones in the list `s` plus one has been incremented by 1, and if `c` is 0, the number of zeroes in the list `s` has been incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
