Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, s is a list of integers, zeroes is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in the list s, cnt is a list containing two integers where cnt[0] is 0 and cnt[1] is 0, ans is 0, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing a binary string.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 1. The variable `_` still holds the value 1. The list `s` now contains a list of integers, which were read from the input. The variable `zeroes` has been updated to count the number of zeroes in the list `s`. The list `cnt` has been reset to contain two integers, both initialized to 0. The variable `ans` has been reset to 0. The stdin now contains `n-3` lines, each containing a binary string, as one line has been read and processed.
