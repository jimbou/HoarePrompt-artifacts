Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains n lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is an empty list, `c` is undefined, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in the original list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to `zeroes` and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of ones in the original list `s`, `ans` is `zeroes` if the original list `s` started with a zero, or `zeroes + number of ones in the original list s - 1` if the original list `s` started with a one, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines, each containing a binary string, and ans is printed ,ans (where ans is the calculated value based on the original list s)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is an empty list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s` and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s`, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines, each containing a binary string, `ans` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` times the number of zeroes in the list `s`, and the value of `ans` which is 0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, s is a list of integers, zeroes is equal to the number of zeroes in the list s, cnt is a list containing two integers where cnt[0] is equal to the number of zeroes in the list s and cnt[1] is equal to the number of ones in the list s, ans is equal to the number of ones in the list s times the number of zeroes in the list s, stdin contains n-5 lines, each containing a binary string, and the product of the number of ones and zeroes in the list s is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
