Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string s sorted in non-descending order.

The program works by iterating over the string s and maintaining a count of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far. It also maintains a count of the total number of zeroes in the string.

For each character in the string, if it is a zero, the program increments the answer by 1 if there are any ones encountered before it. This is because a zero can be moved to the left of a one by performing a cyclic shift operation on the substring ending at the current position.

If the character is a one, the program increments the answer by the number of zeroes that are to the right of the current position. This is because a one can be moved to the right of a zero by performing a cyclic shift operation on the substring starting at the current position.

The program finally prints the total answer, which is the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order.

Correctness: **True**
