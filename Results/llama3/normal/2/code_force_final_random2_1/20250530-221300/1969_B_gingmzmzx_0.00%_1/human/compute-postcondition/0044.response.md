The code prints the value of `ans` which is the product of the number of ones and zeroes in the list `s`. Since `s` is an empty list, the number of ones and zeroes in `s` is 0. Therefore, `ans` is equal to 0.

Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is an empty list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s` and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s`, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines, each containing a binary string, `ans` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` times the number of zeroes in the list `s`, and the value of `ans` which is 0 is being printed**
