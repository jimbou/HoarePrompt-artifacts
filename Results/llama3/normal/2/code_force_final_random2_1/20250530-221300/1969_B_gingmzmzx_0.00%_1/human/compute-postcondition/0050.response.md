Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list `s` and its current value is 0, `zeroes` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s` and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` plus one if `c` is 1, `ans` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` times the number of zeroes in the list `s` plus one if the number of ones in the list `s` plus one if `c` is 1 is greater than 0, stdin contains `n-5` lines, each containing a binary string.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated. If the number of ones in the list `s` plus one if `c` is 1 is greater than 0, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same. The values of the other variables and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
