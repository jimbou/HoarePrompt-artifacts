Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The issue lies in the way it calculates the cost of operations. The program assumes that the cost of an operation is equal to the number of 1's that need to be moved to the end of the string, which is not necessarily true.

A counterexample is the string "101011". The program calculates the cost as 5, but the correct minimum cost is 4. One possible sequence of operations is:

1. Choose substring [1, 3]: 101011 → 011101
2. Choose substring [2, 4]: 011101 → 001111

The total cost of these operations is 4, which is less than the cost calculated by the program.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
