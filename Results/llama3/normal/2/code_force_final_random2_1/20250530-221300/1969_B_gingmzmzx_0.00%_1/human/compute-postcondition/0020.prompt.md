Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, s is a list of integers representing a binary string, zeroes is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in s, cnt is a list containing two integers initialized to 0, ans is 0, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing a binary string.
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers representing a binary string that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is the first integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or not. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`. `stdin` contains `n-1` lines, each containing a binary string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers representing a binary string that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `cnt[0]` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes+1` and `cnt[1]` is either 0 or 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or not. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + 1`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes+1` depending on whether `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or not. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `2*zeroes - cnt[0]`. `stdin` contains `n-1` lines, each containing a binary string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers representing a binary string that must have at least 3 integers, `c` is the third integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `cnt[0]` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes+1` and `cnt[1]` is either 0 or 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or not. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + 2`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either `zeroes+1` or `zeroes+2` depending on whether `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or not. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `2*zeroes - cnt[0] + 1`. `stdin` contains `n-1` lines, each containing a binary string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
