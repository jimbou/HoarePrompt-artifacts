Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, s is a list of integers, zeroes is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in the list s, cnt is a list containing two integers where cnt[0] is 0 and cnt[1] is 0, ans is 0, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing a binary string.
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is 1 and `cnt[1]` is 0, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines, each containing a binary string, `c` is the first element of the list `s`. If `c` is 0, then `ans` is 0. If `c` is not 0, then `ans` is `zeroes - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is 1 and `cnt[1]` is 1 if `c` is not 0, otherwise `cnt[1]` is 0, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines, each containing a binary string, `c` is the second element of the list `s`. If `c` is 0, then `ans` is 0. If `c` is not 0, then `ans` is `zeroes - 1` if `c` is not 0 and `ans` is `2 * zeroes - 2` if `c` is not 0 and `ans` is `zeroes` if `c` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is 1 and `cnt[1]` is 2 if `c` is not 0, otherwise `cnt[1]` is 1, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines, each containing a binary string, `c` is the third element of the list `s`. If `c` is 0, then `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - 1`. If `c` is not 0, then `ans` is `zeroes` if `cnt[1]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - 1` if `cnt[1]` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `2 * zeroes - 3`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
