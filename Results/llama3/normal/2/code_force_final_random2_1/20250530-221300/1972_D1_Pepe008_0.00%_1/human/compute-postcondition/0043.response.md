Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer that is at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 1, `suma` is ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1), `x` is ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1). The current value of `a` minus `i` times `i` minus 1 is greater than 0**

The value of `suma` is updated by adding `x` to it. Since `x` is equal to `((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1)`, which is equivalent to `a`, the value of `suma` becomes `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
