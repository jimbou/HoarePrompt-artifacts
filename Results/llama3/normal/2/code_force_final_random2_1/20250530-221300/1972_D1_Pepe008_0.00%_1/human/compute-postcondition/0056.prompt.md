Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains two positive integers n and m, each less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(T):
    info = input().split()
    a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
    """for i in range(1,a+1):
        for j in range(4,b+1):
            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:
                print(i,j)"""
    suma = 0
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
        if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
            suma += x
    print(suma - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is `b`, `x` is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if `a - b * (b - 1)` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `x` is 0. `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated in each iteration of the loop. The loop iterates from 1 to `b` (inclusive), and in each iteration, it calculates the value of `x` based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is a positive integer that is at least 2, t is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, info is a list containing two strings, i is b, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - b * (b - 1) is greater than 0. Otherwise, x is 0, suma is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) for all i from 1 to b, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed, which is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) for all i from 1 to b minus 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is a positive integer that is at least 3, t is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, a is an integer, b is an integer, info is a list containing two strings, i is b, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - b * (b - 1) is greater than 0. Otherwise, x is 0, suma is the sum of ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1), ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2), ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3), and so on up to ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0 for each i from 1 to b, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
