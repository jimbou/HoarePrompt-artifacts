Output State: **T is a positive integer that is at least 1, t is T-1, stdin contains no test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, info is a list containing two strings, i is b, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - b * (b - 1) is greater than 0. Otherwise, x is 0, suma is the sum of ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1), ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2), ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3), and so on up to ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0 for each i from 1 to b, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed.**

This output state means that the loop has executed T times, and all test cases from stdin have been processed. The values of a, b, info, i, and x are the same as in the previous iterations, but the value of suma is the sum of all calculated values of x for each iteration of the loop. The loop has finished executing, and the final value of suma - 1 is being printed.
