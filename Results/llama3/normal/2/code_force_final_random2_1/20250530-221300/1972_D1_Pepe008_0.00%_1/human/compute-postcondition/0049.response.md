To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `b + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `b` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `b` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `T`, `t`, `stdin`, `a`, `suma`, and `x`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer that is at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 3**
