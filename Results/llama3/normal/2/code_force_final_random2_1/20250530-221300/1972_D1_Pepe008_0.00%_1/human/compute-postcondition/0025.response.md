Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` must be at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 1, `suma` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i), and the value of (a - i * (i - 1)) is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `suma` has been updated to be the current value of `x`, which is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i). The other variables remain unchanged.
