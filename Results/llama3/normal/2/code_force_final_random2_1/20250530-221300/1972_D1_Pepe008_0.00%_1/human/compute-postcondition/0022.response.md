To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `b`. The loop will execute if `b` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `b + 1`. 

State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` must be at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 1, `x` is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - b * (b - 1) is greater than 0. Otherwise, x is 0, `suma` is 0**
