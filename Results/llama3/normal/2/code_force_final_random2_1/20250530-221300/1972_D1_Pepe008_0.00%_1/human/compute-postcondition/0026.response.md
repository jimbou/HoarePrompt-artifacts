Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` must be at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 1. If the value of `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, then `suma` is set to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i).***
