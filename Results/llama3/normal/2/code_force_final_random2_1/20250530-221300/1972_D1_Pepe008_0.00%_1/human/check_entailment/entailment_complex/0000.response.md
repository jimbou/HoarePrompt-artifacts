Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The program uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible values of a and b, and for each pair, it checks if the condition is satisfied. If it is, it increments a counter.

However, the program has a logical error. The condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) is not equivalent to the condition (j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j)) == 0. The correct condition should be (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0.

Moreover, the program is not using the correct formula to calculate the sum of the series. The formula (a - i * (i - 1)) // i is not related to the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
