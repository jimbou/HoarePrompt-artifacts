Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `info` is a list containing two strings, `suma` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is a positive integer equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2) + 1`**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2) + 1`, which is a positive integer. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
