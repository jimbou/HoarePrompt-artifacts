Output: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is `b`, `x` is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if `a - b * (b - 1)` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `x` is 0. `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated in each iteration of the loop. The loop iterates from 1 to `b` (inclusive), and in each iteration, it calculates the value of `x` based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, it adds `x` to `suma`. After the loop finishes, `i` is equal to `b`, and `x` is the last calculated value. The final value of `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated in each iteration. The other variables (`T`, `t`, `stdin`, `a`, `info`) remain unchanged. The value of `suma - 1` is printed.**
