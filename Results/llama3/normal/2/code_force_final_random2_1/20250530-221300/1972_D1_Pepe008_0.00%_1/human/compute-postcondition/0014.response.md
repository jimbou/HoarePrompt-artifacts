Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `info` is a list containing two strings, `suma` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3), `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3)**

In this output state, the value of `suma` has been updated by adding the value of `x` to it. The value of `suma` is now the sum of its original value and the value of `x`, which is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
