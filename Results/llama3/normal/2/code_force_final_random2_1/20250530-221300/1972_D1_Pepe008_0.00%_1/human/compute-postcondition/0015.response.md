Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3). If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, then `suma` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3). Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.***
