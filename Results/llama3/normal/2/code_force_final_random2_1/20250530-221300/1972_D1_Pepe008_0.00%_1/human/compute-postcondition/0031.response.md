The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `b` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `b` must be greater than 2.
State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` must be at least 3, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 3**
