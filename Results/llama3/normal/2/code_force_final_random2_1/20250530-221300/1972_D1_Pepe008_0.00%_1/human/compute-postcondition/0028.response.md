Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` must be at least 2, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 2, `suma` is set to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) if the value of `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `x` is set to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` remains a positive integer that is at least 2, `t` remains 1, there is one less test case in `stdin`, `a` is still a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` is still at least 2, `info` is still a list containing two strings, `i` is still 2, `suma` is still set to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) if the value of `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, and a new variable `x` is introduced, which is set to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1).
