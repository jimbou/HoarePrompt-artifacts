Output State: *`T` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `info` is a list containing two strings, `suma` is the sum of `x` for all iterations where `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `i` is `b`, `x` is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if `a - b * (b - 1)` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.*

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will iterate from 1 to `b` (inclusive), and in each iteration, it will calculate the value of `x` based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. If the result of `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, it will add `x` to the `suma`. After the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `b`, and `x` will be the result of the last iteration. The values of `T`, `t`, `stdin`, `a`, and `info` remain unchanged.
