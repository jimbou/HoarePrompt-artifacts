State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is `b`, `x` is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if `a - b * (b - 1)` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `x` is 0. `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated in each iteration of the loop.**
