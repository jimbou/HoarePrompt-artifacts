Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer that is at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 2, `suma` is ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1) + ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2), `x` is ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` has been updated by adding the value of `x` to it. The new value of `suma` is the sum of its original value and the value of `x`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
