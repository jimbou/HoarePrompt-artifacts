Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer that is at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1)**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to `((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1)`, which simplifies to `(a // 1 + 1)`, and further simplifies to `(a + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
