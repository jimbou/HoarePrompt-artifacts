According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make the state more specific, we can adjust `T` to be at least 1. Additionally, since `t` is the loop variable, we can initialize it to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `t` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains two positive integers n and m, each less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.**
