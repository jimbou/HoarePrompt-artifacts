Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer that is at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 2, `suma` is ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1), `x` is ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2 ** 2 + 1)**

In natural language, the output state is: T is a positive integer that is at least 3, t is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, a is an integer, b is an integer that is at least 1, info is a list containing two strings, i is 2, suma is equal to a minus 0 divided by 1, and x is equal to a minus 2 times 1 divided by 2 squared plus 1.
