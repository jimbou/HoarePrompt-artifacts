Output State: **T is a positive integer that is at least 2, t is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, info is a list containing two strings, i is b, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - b * (b - 1) is greater than 0. Otherwise, x is 0, suma is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) for all i from 1 to b.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of T, t, stdin, a, b, and info remain unchanged. The value of i is now equal to b, and the value of x is calculated based on the value of a and b. The value of suma is the sum of the values of x for all iterations of the loop.
