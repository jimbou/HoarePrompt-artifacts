Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` must be at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T` is still a positive integer that is at least 2, the value of `t` is still 1, the value of `a` is still a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, the value of `b` is still at least 1, the value of `info` is still a list containing two strings, the value of `i` is still 1, the value of `suma` is still 0. The value of `x` has been updated to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1).
