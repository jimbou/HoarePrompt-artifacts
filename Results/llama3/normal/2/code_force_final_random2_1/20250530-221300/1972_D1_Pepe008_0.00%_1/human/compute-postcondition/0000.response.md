Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains two positive integers n and m, each less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.**

In this output state, `T` is assigned the value of the first line of the input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The remaining test cases still contain two positive integers `n` and `m`, each less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.
