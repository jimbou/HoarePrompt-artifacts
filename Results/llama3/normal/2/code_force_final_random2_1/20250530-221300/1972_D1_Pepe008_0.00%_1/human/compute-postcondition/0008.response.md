The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `b` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be at least 2.
State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `info` is a list containing two strings, `suma` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is a positive integer equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1))` is greater than 0, `suma` is updated to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`**
