Output State: **T is a positive integer that is at least 2, t is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, info is a list containing two strings, i is b, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - b * (b - 1) is greater than 0. Otherwise, x is 0, suma is 0.**

The first line reads a line from stdin and splits it into two strings, which are then converted to integers and assigned to `a` and `b`. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by one. The second line does not affect any variables. The third line initializes `suma` to 0. The commented-out code does not affect any variables. The value of `x` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `b`, but it is not assigned to any variable. The value of `i` is set to `b`. The values of `T` and `t` remain unchanged.
