Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` must be at least 2, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 2. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `suma` is set to twice the value of `x` and `x` is set to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i). Otherwise, no changes are made to `suma` and `x`.***
