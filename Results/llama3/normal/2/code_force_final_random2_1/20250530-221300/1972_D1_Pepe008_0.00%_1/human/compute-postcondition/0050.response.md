Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer that is at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 ** 2 + 1)**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still a positive integer that is at least 3, t is still 2, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three, a is still an integer, b is still an integer that is at least 1, info is still a list containing two strings, i is still 3, and a new variable x is introduced, which is calculated based on the values of a and i.
