Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer that is at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `suma` is increased by ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3).***
