Output: **T is a positive integer that is at least 3, t is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, a is an integer, b is an integer, info is a list containing two strings, i is b, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - b * (b - 1) is greater than 0. Otherwise, x is 0, suma is the sum of ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1), ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2), ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3), and so on up to ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0 for each i from 1 to b, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed**
