Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `suma` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`, `i` is 1, `x` is a positive integer equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. The current value of `(a - i * (i - 1))` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is a positive integer calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
