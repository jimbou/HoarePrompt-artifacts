Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `info` is a list containing two strings, `suma` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i), `i` is 2, `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)**

In this output state, the value of `suma` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value (0) and the value of `x`, which is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
