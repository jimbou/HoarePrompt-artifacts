Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` must be at least 3, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 3, `x` is equal to `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `suma` is increased by `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3.***
