Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` must be at least 2, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 2, `suma` is set to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i), `x` is set to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` has been updated by adding the value of `x` to it. The values of `T`, `t`, `stdin`, `a`, `b`, `info`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `suma` is now the sum of two times the integer division of `a - i * (i - 1)` by `i`.
