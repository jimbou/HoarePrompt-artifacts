The only variable in the loop head is variable `t` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1, `T` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be increased by 1, so `t` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 2.
State: **T is a positive integer that is at least 3, t is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, info is a list containing two strings, i is b, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - b * (b - 1) is greater than 0. Otherwise, x is 0, suma is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) for all i from 1 to b, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed, which is the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) for all i from 1 to b minus 1**
