To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `b`. If `b` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `b` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, we can adjust its state to be at least 1.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, we can adjust its state to be the starting value of the loop, which is 1.

The other variables, `T`, `t`, `stdin`, `a`, `info`, and `suma`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1**
