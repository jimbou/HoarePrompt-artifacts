Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the calculation of the variable x. The expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is not correct.

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of a and b, and for each pair, check if the conditions are satisfied. The condition `a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b)` can be checked using the modulo operator.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, a+1):
            for j in range(1, b+1):
                if (i + j) % (j * math.gcd(i, j)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)
```

This program correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.
