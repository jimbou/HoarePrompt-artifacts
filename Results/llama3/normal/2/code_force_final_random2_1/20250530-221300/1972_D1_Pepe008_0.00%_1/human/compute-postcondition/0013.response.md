Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `info` is a list containing two strings, `suma` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i), `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3) ** 2 + 1 if a - 3 * (3 - 1) > 0. Otherwise, the values of `suma`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `T`, `t`, `stdin`, `a`, `b`, `info`, `suma`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is updated to be the result of the expression `((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3) ** 2 + 1` if `a - 3 * (3 - 1) > 0`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
