Output State: **T is a positive integer that is at least 3, t is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, a is an integer, b is an integer, info is a list containing two strings, i is b, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - b * (b - 1) is greater than 0. Otherwise, x is 0, suma is 0**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The value of `suma` is reset to 0. The value of `i` is updated to be equal to `b`. The value of `x` is updated based on the new values of `a` and `b`. The value of `T`, `t`, and the remaining test cases in stdin are not affected by the code.
