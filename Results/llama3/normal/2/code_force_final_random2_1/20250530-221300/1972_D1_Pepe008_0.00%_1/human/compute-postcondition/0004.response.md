Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is a positive integer equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `i`, and is a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, which is a positive integer.
