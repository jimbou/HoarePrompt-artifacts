Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer that is at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 3, `x` is ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3, `suma` is increased by ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` has been increased by the value of `x`, which is calculated as ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3). The values of the other variables remain the same.
