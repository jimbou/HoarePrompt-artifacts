Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer that is at least 1, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 1, `suma` is ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1), `x` is ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1). If the current value of `a` minus `i` times `i` minus 1 is greater than 0, then `suma` is updated to the value of `x`.**
