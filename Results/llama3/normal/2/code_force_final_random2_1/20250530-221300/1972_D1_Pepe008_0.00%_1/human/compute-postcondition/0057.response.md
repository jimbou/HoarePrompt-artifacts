Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. It then calculates the sum of a series of values based on the formula (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1, where i ranges from 1 to m, and prints the result minus 1 for each test case. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value.**
