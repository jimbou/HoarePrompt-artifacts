Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a specific problem involving ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers n and m, and calculates the sum of a series of values based on a specific formula.

Upon analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the required logic. The formula used to calculate the sum is based on the conditions specified in the problem, and the program correctly handles the input and output operations.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program is subtracting 1 from the calculated sum before printing it, which is incorrect. The correct program should print the calculated sum without subtracting 1.

Correctness: **False**
