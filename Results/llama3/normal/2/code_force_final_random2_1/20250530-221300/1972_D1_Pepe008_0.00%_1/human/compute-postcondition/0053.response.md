Output State: **T is a positive integer that is at least 3, t is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, a is an integer, b is an integer, info is a list containing two strings, i is b, x is ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - b * (b - 1) is greater than 0. Otherwise, x is 0, suma is the sum of ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1), ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2), ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3), and so on up to ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0 for each i from 1 to b.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The value of T remains unchanged as a positive integer that is at least 3. The value of t remains unchanged as 2. The value of stdin remains unchanged as multiple test cases minus three. The value of a remains unchanged as an integer. The value of b remains unchanged as an integer. The value of info remains unchanged as a list containing two strings. The value of i is now equal to b. The value of x is now equal to ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - b * (b - 1) is greater than 0. Otherwise, x is 0. The value of suma is now the sum of ((a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1), ((a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2), ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3), and so on up to ((a - b * (b - 1)) // b) if a - i * (i - 1) is greater than 0 for each i from 1 to b.
