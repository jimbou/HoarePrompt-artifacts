Output State: **`T` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `a` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `b` must be at least 3, `info` is a list containing two strings, `i` is 3, `x` is equal to `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3, `suma` is increased by `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` is increased by the value of `x`, which is calculated as `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
