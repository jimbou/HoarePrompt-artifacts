The code reads the entire standard input into a string using `sys.stdin.read()`, splits it into a list of words using the `split()` method, and stores it in the `data` variable. The `index` variable is initialized to 0 to keep track of the current position in the `data` list. The first element of the `data` list is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The `index` is incremented by 1 to move to the next element in the `data` list. An empty list called `results` is created to store the results of each test case.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), data is a list of strings, index is 1, results is an empty list**
