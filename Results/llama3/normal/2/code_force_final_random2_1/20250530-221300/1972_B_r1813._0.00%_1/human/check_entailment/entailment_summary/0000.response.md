Reasoning: 
The program is correct. It reads the input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each case based on whether the number of 'U' characters in a given string is odd or even. This is a correct solution to the problem because the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of the players will win. The key insight is that if the number of 'U' characters is odd, Alice will win, and if it is even, Bob will win. This is because Alice goes first and can always choose a coin that will leave Bob with an even number of 'U' characters, forcing him to lose.

Correctness: **True**
