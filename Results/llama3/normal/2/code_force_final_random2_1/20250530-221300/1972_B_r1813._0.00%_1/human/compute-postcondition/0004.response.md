Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES', `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, and `num_up_coins` is an odd integer.**

In this output state, the only change is that the `results` list now contains the string 'YES', which was appended by the code. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties.
