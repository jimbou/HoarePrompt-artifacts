The only object in the loop head is variable  result and list results, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results.  If the list has at least 3 'YES' strings the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, results has at least 2 'YES' strings, result is the second 'YES' string in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 'YES' strings and the result is the third 'YES' string in the list.
State: **`t` is 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `_` is -1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data[-1], `s` is a string equal to the value of data[0], `num_up_coins` is an odd integer, `results` is a list containing at least 3 'YES' strings, `result` is the third 'YES' string in the list**
