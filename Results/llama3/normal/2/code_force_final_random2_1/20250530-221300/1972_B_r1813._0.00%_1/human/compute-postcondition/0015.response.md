Output State: **_t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), data is a list of strings, index is 7, _ is 2, n is an integer equal to the value of data[5], s is a string equal to the value of data[6], num_up_coins is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in s, results is a list containing the string 'YES' and 'YES' if num_up_coins is odd, or 'NO', 'NO', 'YES' if num_up_coins is even.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for the results list. If the number of 'U' characters in string s is odd, the results list contains two 'YES' strings. If the number of 'U' characters in string s is even, the results list contains two 'NO' strings followed by a 'YES' string.
