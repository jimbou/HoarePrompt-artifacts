Output State: **t is an integer equal to 0, data is a list of strings, index is equal to 2t + 1, _ is equal to t - 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[2t - 1], s is a string equal to the value of data[2t], and num_up_coins is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in s. If num_up_coins is odd, results is a list containing t 'YES' strings. If num_up_coins is even, results is a list containing t 'NO' strings.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the variable 't' equal to 0, 'data' remains unchanged, 'index' will be equal to 2 times the initial value of 't' plus 1, '_' will be equal to the initial value of 't' minus 1, 'n' and 's' will be equal to the last two elements of 'data' that were processed in the loop, and 'num_up_coins' will be equal to the number of 'U' characters in the last string 's' processed in the loop. The 'results' list will contain either 't' 'YES' strings if 'num_up_coins' is odd, or 't' 'NO' strings if 'num_up_coins' is even.
