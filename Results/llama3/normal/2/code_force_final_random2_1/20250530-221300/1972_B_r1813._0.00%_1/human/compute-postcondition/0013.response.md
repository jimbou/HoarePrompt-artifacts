The only variable in the loop head is variable  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **_t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), data is a list of strings, index is 5, _ is 2, n is an integer equal to the value of data[3], s is a string equal to the value of data[4], and num_up_coins is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in s. If num_up_coins is odd, results is a list containing the string 'YES' and 'YES'. If num_up_coins is even, results is a list containing the string 'NO' and 'NO'.**
