Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to 0, data is a list of strings, index is equal to 2t + 1, _ is equal to t - 1, n is an integer equal to the value of data[2t - 1], s is a string equal to the value of data[2t], and num_up_coins is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in s. If num_up_coins is odd, results is a list containing t 'YES' strings. If num_up_coins is even, results is a list containing t 'NO' strings.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `_` is -1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data[-1], `s` is a string equal to the value of data[0], `num_up_coins` is an odd integer, `results` is a list containing at least one 'YES' string, `result` is the first 'YES' string in the list, and the first 'YES' string in the list which is 'YES' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `_` is -1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data[-1], `s` is a string equal to the value of data[0], `num_up_coins` is an odd integer, `results` is a list containing at least 2 'YES' strings, `result` is the second 'YES' string in the list, and the second 'YES' string in the list which is 'YES' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `_` is -1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data[-1], `s` is a string equal to the value of data[0], `num_up_coins` is an odd integer, `results` is a list containing at least 3 'YES' strings, `result` is the third 'YES' string in the list, and the third 'YES' string in the list which is 'YES' is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
