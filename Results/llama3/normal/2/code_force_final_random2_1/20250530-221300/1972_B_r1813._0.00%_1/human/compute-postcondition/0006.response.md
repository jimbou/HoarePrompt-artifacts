Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 3, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO', `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `num_up_coins` is an integer and the remainder of `num_up_coins` divided by 2 is 0**

In this output state, the code has appended the string 'NO' to the `results` list, which was initially empty. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
