According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we can still adjust the state of `_` (the loop variable) to reflect that it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
