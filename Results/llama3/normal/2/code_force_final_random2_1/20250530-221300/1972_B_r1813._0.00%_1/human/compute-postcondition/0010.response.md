Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data[3]`, `s` is a string equal to the value of `data[4]`, `num_up_coins` is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in `s`, and `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' if `num_up_coins` is odd, otherwise it contains the string 'NO' and 'YES'.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer between 1 and 100, `data` is still a list of strings, `index` is still 5, `_` is still 1, `n` is still equal to the value of `data[3]`, `s` is still equal to the value of `data[4]`, and `num_up_coins` is still equal to the number of 'U' characters in `s`. However, the list `results` has been appended with the string 'YES', regardless of whether `num_up_coins` is odd or even.
