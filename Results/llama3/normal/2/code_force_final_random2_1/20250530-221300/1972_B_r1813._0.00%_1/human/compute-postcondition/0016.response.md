Output State: **_t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), data is a list of strings, index is 7, _ is 2, n is an integer equal to the value of data[5], s is a string equal to the value of data[6], num_up_coins is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in s, and results is a list containing the string 'NO' and either 'YES' and 'YES' if num_up_coins is odd or 'NO' and 'NO' if num_up_coins is even, and then 'NO' is appended to results.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for the results list, which now has an additional 'NO' appended to it. If num_up_coins is odd, results contains 'YES', 'YES', and 'NO'. If num_up_coins is even, results contains 'NO', 'NO', and 'NO'.
