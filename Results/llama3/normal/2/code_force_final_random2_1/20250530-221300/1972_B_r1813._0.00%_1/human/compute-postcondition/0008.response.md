To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 1.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

The states of other variables (`data`, `index`, `n`, `s`, `num_up_coins`, and `results`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 3, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, and `num_up_coins` is an integer. If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES'. If `num_up_coins` is even, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO'.**
