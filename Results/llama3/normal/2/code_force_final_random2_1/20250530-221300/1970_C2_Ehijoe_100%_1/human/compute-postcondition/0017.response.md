Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with at least 3 keys, start is a node in the tree represented by an integer, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n - 1, stdin contains no input. If the number of elements in the value of the third key in the dictionary nodes is exactly 1, then leaves is a deque containing the first key, the second key, the third key and the key in the dictionary nodes. Otherwise, leaves is a deque containing the first key, the second key and the key in the dictionary nodes.**

In this output state, the code has appended the key to the deque leaves. If the number of elements in the value of the third key in the dictionary nodes is exactly 1, then leaves now contains the first key, the second key, the third key, and the key. Otherwise, leaves now contains the first key, the second key, and the key. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
