Postcondition: ***nodes is a dictionary with at least 1 key, start is a node in the tree represented by an integer, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n - 1, stdin contains no input, and if the number of elements in the value of the first key in the dictionary nodes is exactly 1, then leaves is a deque containing the first key in the dictionary nodes. Otherwise, leaves remains an empty deque.***
