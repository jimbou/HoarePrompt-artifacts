Determines if there is a node in the tree structure that has a certain property, as evaluated by the function `func_1`, and returns True if such a node exists and False otherwise. The function takes as input a tree structure represented as a list of lists of integers, a start node, and its parent node, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the property is satisfied for any node in the subtree rooted at the start node, excluding the parent node.
