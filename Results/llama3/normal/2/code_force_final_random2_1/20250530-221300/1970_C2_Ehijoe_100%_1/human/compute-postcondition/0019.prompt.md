Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: nodes is a dictionary with n keys, each containing a list with n - 1 elements, start is a node in the tree represented by an integer, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n - 1, leaves is an empty deque, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *nodes is a dictionary with at least 1 key, start is a node in the tree represented by an integer, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n - 1, stdin contains no input, and if the number of elements in the value of the first key in the dictionary nodes is exactly 1, then leaves is a deque containing the first key in the dictionary nodes. Otherwise, leaves remains an empty deque.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *nodes is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, start is a node in the tree represented by an integer, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n - 1, stdin contains no input. If the number of elements in the value of the second key in the dictionary nodes is exactly 1, then leaves is a deque containing the first key and the second key in the dictionary nodes. Otherwise, leaves remains an empty deque.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *nodes is a dictionary with at least 3 keys, start is a node in the tree represented by an integer, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n - 1, stdin contains no input. If the number of elements in the value of the third key in the dictionary nodes is exactly 1, then leaves is a deque containing the first key, the second key, the third key and the key in the dictionary nodes. Otherwise, leaves is a deque containing the first key, the second key and the key in the dictionary nodes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
