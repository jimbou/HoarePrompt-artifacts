Postcondition: ***nodes is a dictionary with at least 3 keys, start is a node in the tree represented by an integer, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n - 1, stdin contains no input. If the number of elements in the value of the third key in the dictionary nodes is exactly 1, then leaves is a deque containing the first key, the second key, the third key and the key in the dictionary nodes. Otherwise, leaves is a deque containing the first key, the second key and the key in the dictionary nodes.***
