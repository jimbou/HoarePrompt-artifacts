Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, start is a node in the tree represented by an integer, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n - 1, stdin contains no input, and leaves is a deque containing the first key in the dictionary nodes and the second key in the dictionary nodes.**

In natural language, the output state is: The nodes dictionary remains unchanged with at least 2 keys. The start node, represented by an integer, remains the same. The values of n and t remain unchanged. The edges list is still empty. The empty variable is still True. The value of i is still n - 1. There is no input in stdin. The leaves deque now contains the first key in the dictionary nodes and the second key in the dictionary nodes.
