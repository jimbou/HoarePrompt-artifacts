Output State: **nodes is an empty dictionary, start is a node in the tree represented by an integer, n and t are integers, edges is an empty list, empty is True**

The code snippet consists of five lines. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n` and `t`. The second line initializes an empty list `edges`. The third line initializes a boolean variable `empty` to `True`. The fourth line initializes an empty dictionary `nodes` using the `defaultdict` function from the `collections` module. 

The initial state of `nodes` as a dictionary where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes is lost. The initial state of `start` as a node in the tree represented by an integer remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `t` are updated to the integer values of the input. The list `edges` and the dictionary `nodes` are empty. The boolean variable `empty` is `True`.
