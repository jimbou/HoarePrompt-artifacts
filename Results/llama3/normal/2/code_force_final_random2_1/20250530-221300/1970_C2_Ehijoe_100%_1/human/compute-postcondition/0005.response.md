To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head variables and how they change from the previous iteration. The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `nodes` is a dictionary with two keys, `u` and `v`, each containing a list with two elements, the other node and the new node.
- `start` is a node in the tree represented by an integer.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `t` is an integer.
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `empty` is True.
- `i` is 1.
- `stdin` contains no input.

And the loop statement:
```
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

To execute the loop again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Also, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 2 to ensure that `n - 1` is at least 2, allowing the loop to run at least one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration, focusing only on the changes to the loop head variables and their implications, is:

State: **`nodes` is a dictionary with two keys, `u` and `v`, each containing a list with two elements, the other node and the new node, `start` is a node in the tree represented by an integer, `n` is greater than 2, `t` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains no input**
