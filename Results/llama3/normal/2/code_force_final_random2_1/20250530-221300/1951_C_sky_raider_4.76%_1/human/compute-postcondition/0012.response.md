Output State: **i is n, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers, s is 0, c is k squared divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

Here's a description of the final state in natural language:

The value of `i` remains unchanged as `n`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integer values read from the input. The list `l` is sorted in ascending order. The variable `s` is reset to 0. The variable `c` is recalculated as `k` squared divided by 2. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, as two inputs have been read and processed.
