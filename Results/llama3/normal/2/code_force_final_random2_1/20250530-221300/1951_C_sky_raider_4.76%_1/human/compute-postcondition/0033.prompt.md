Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= min(nm, 10^9)). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    s = 0
    c = k * k / 2
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        k -= s
        c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is n minus 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer minus n times the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k squared divided by 2 plus the sum of the products of the first n elements of l and the minimum of m and k minus the sum of the squares of the minimum of m and k divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the integer value of c is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is n minus 1, n is greater than 0, m is an integer, k is an integer minus n times min(m, k), l is a sorted list of integers, s is min(m, k), c is k squared divided by 2 plus the sum of l[i] times min(m, k) minus min(m, k) squared divided by 2 for all i from 0 to n minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the integer value of c is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, k is an integer equal to its original value minus n times the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k squared divided by 2 plus the sum of the products of the first n elements of l and the minimum of m and k minus the sum of the squares of the minimum of m and k divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is n-1, and the integer value of c is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
