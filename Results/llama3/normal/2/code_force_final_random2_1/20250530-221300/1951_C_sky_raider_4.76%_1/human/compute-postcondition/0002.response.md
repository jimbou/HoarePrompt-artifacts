To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to 0, which is already the case.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `s` is 0, `c` is k squared divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
