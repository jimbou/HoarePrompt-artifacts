Output State: **i is 1, n is greater than 1, m is an integer, k is an integer minus 2 times min(m, k), l is a sorted list of integers, s is min(m, k), c is k squared divided by 2 plus l[i] times min(m, k) minus min(m, k) squared divided by 2 plus l[i] times min(m, k) minus min(m, k) squared divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `s` is updated to be the minimum of `m` and `k`. The value of `k` is then decreased by `s`, which is equivalent to subtracting the minimum of `m` and `k` from `k`. The value of `c` is updated by adding the product of `l[i]` and `s`, and subtracting the square of `s` divided by 2. This change to `c` is equivalent to adding the product of `l[i]` and the minimum of `m` and `k`, and subtracting the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2.
