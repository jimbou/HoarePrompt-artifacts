Output State: **i is 2, n is greater than 2, m is an integer, k is an integer minus twice the minimum of m and k minus the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k squared divided by 2 plus the product of the first element of l and the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 plus the product of the second element of l and the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 plus the product of the third element of l and the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

The first line assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to `s`. The second line decrements `k` by the value of `s`, effectively making `k` equal to its original value minus twice the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the minimum of `m` and `k`. The third line updates the value of `c` by adding the product of the third element of `l` and the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2 to its original value. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged.
