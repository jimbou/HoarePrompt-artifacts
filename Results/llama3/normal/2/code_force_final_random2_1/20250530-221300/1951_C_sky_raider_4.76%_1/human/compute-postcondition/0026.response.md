To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus the minimum of `m` and `k`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is `k` squared divided by 2 plus the product of the first element of `l` and the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1**
