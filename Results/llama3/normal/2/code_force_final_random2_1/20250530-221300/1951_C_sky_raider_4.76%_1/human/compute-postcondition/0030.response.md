Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, k is an integer equal to its original value minus n times the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k squared divided by 2 plus the sum of the products of the first n elements of l and the minimum of m and k minus the sum of the squares of the minimum of m and k divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is n-1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:

* n remains an integer, but its value may have changed depending on the number of iterations.
* m remains an integer, unchanged.
* k is reduced by n times the minimum of m and k.
* l remains a sorted list of integers, unchanged.
* s is still the minimum of m and k.
* c is updated to include the sum of the products of the first n elements of l and the minimum of m and k, minus the sum of the squares of the minimum of m and k divided by 2.
* stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
* i is now equal to n-1, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
