Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program sorts the list of ticket prices, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem. The correct approach is to consider the prices in the order they are given, as the price increase mechanism depends on the order of purchases.

The program also calculates the value `c` incorrectly. The correct calculation should take into account the price increase mechanism, where the price of each ticket increases by the number of tickets purchased on previous days.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than `n*m`, which is a valid input according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
