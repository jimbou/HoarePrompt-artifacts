Output State: **i is n minus 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer minus n times the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k squared divided by 2 plus the sum of the products of the first n elements of l and the minimum of m and k minus the sum of the squares of the minimum of m and k divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the number of iterations. The variables `m`, `l`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The variable `k` will be reduced by `n` times the minimum of `m` and `k`. The variable `s` will still be equal to the minimum of `m` and `k`. The variable `c` will be the sum of the products of the first `n` elements of `l` and the minimum of `m` and `k`, minus the sum of the squares of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2, plus the initial value of `c` which is `k` squared divided by 2.
