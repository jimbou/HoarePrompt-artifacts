Output State: **i is 0, n is at least 1, m is an integer, k is an integer minus the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k squared divided by 2 plus the product of the first element of l and the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `n` is still at least 1. The value of `m` is still an integer. The value of `k` is reduced by the minimum of `m` and `k`. The list `l` remains a sorted list of integers. The value of `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`. The value of `c` is updated to be the original value of `k` squared divided by 2, plus the product of the first element of `l` and the minimum of `m` and `k`, minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
