Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The problem description states that the price per ticket increases by x if x tickets are purchased on day i, but the program does not take this into account. It simply sorts the prices and calculates the total cost without considering the price increase.

A counterexample is when n = 3, m = 2, k = 3, and the prices are [1, 2, 3]. The program will output 6, but the correct answer is 7. The correct sequence of purchases is:

* Buy 2 tickets on day 1 with cost 2. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [3, 4].
* Buy 1 ticket on day 2 with cost 3.

The total cost is 2 + 3 = 5, but the program will output 6 because it does not correctly calculate the price increase.
