Output State: **`a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`, `n` is an integer at least 2, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings of length `n`, `_` is 2, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `x` is an integer equal to `n - 1`, `t` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The input in stdin is still present, waiting to be processed.
