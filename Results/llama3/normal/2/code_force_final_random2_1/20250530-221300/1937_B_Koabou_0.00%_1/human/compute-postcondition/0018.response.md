Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two binary strings of length n, n is an integer at least 3, s is a binary string of length n. If a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', then s is equal to a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:], x is equal to i, and i is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to s, x, or i.***
