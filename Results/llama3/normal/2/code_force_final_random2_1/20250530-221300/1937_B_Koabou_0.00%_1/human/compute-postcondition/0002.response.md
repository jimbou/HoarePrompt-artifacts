Output State: **`a` is a list containing one binary string of length `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two inputs: two binary strings of length n, `_` is 0**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains one binary string of length `n`, which was read from the input. The value of `n` remains the same, equal to the first input from stdin. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, but each test case now has two inputs: two binary strings of length `n`. The value of `_` is still 0.
