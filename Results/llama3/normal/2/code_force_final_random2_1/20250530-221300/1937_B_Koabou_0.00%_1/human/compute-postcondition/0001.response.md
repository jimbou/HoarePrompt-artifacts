The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the constant 2, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the constant 2. If the constant 2 is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, a is an empty list and n is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings of length n. So for the loop to be executed  the constant 2 is at least 1 and _ is 0.
State: **`a` is an empty list, `n` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings of length n, `_` is 0**
