Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two binary strings of length n, n is an integer at least 2, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings of length n, _ is 2, s is a binary string of length n if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0', otherwise s is an empty list, x is an integer equal to i if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0', otherwise x is 0, i is an integer***
