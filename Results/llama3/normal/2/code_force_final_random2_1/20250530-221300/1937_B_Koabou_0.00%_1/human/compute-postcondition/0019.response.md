Output State: **a is a list containing two binary strings of length n, n is an integer at least 2, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings of length n, _ is 2, s is a binary string of length n, x is an integer equal to n - 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that 'a' remains a list containing two binary strings of length 'n', 'n' remains an integer at least 2, 'stdin' still contains multiple test cases, each test case still contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings of length 'n', '_' is still 2, 's' is a binary string of length 'n', and 'x' is an integer equal to 'n - 1'.
