This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two binary strings of length n. It then attempts to find a prefix of the first binary string that matches a suffix of the second binary string, and if found, constructs a new binary string by concatenating the prefix with the suffix. The function prints the constructed binary string and the length of the prefix. If no matching prefix is found, it prints the first binary string and 1.
