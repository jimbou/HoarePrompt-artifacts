The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 2. However, since `_` is 2, the loop will not execute again because `_` is not less than 2. But since we are asked to provide the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to provide the state as if the loop was going to execute again.

State: **`a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two inputs: two binary strings of length n, `_` is 2**
