Output State: **a is a list containing two binary strings of length n, n is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings of length n, _ is 2, s is an empty list, x is 0**

The code initializes an empty list `s` and a variable `x` with the value 0. The initial state's variables `a`, `n`, and stdin remain unchanged as the code does not modify them. The new variables `s` and `x` are added to the state with their respective values.
