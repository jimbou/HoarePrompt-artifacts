Output State: **`a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`, `n` is an integer at least 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings of length `n`, `_` is 2, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `x` is an integer equal to `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`. If the first `i + 1` characters of the first binary string in `a` are equal to the first `i + 1` characters of `s`, then `t` is `x - i + 1`. Otherwise, `t` is 1.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `i` has reached `n - 1`, which is the maximum value it can take. The value of `t` is determined based on whether the first `i + 1` characters of the first binary string in `a` are equal to the first `i + 1` characters of `s`. If they are equal, then `t` is `x - i + 1`, otherwise, `t` is 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
