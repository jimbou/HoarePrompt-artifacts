Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`, `n` is an integer at least 2, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings of length `n`, `_` is 2, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and the current value of `a[1][i]` is '0'.**
