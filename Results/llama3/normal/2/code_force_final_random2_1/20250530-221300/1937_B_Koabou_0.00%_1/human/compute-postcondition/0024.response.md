Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two binary strings of length n, n is an integer at least 2, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings of length n, _ is 2, s is a binary string of length n, x is an integer equal to n - 1 and must be at least 1, t is x - i + 1 if the first i + 1 characters of the first binary string in a are equal to the first i + 1 characters of s, otherwise t is 1, i is 0.***
