To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(x):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is an integer equal to `n - 1` and must be at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `x` is equal to `n - 1`, it remains the same.

The other variables in the state, such as `a`, `n`, `stdin`, `_`, `s`, and `t`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`, `n` is an integer at least 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings of length `n`, `_` is 2, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `x` is an integer equal to `n - 1` and must be at least 2, `i` is 2, if the first `i` characters of the first binary string in `a` are equal to the first `i` characters of `s`, then `t` is `x - i + 1`, otherwise `t` is 1**
