The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again the range must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is a list containing one binary string of length `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two inputs: two binary strings of length n, `_` is 2**
