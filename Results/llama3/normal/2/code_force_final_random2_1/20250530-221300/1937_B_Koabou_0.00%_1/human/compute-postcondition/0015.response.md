Postcondition: **a is a list containing two binary strings of length n, n is an integer at least 3. If a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0', then s is a binary string of length n, x is an integer equal to i, and i is an integer increased by 1. Otherwise, s is an empty list, x is 0, and i remains unchanged.**
