To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1.

State: **`a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`, `n` is an integer at least 2, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings of length `n`, `_` is 2, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `x` is an integer equal to `n - 1` and must be at least 1, `t` is 1, `i` is 0**
