Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the lexicographically smallest string is not a simple concatenation of the first and second rows. For example, when the input is:

3
2
01
10

The program will output "011 1", but the correct output should be "010 2". The program does not correctly count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.

In this case, the program does not work correctly because it does not consider the case when the lexicographically smallest string is a combination of the first and second rows, but not a simple concatenation. The program only checks for the first occurrence of a '1' in the second row and a '0' in the first row, and then concatenates the rest of the rows. However, this approach does not work when the lexicographically smallest string is a combination of the two rows.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
