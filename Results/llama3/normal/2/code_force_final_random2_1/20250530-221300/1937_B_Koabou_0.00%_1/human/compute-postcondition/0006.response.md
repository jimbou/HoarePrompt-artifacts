Output State: **`a` is a list containing three binary strings of length `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each test case contains two inputs: two binary strings of length n, `_` is 2**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains three binary strings of length `n`, where `n` is still an integer equal to the first input from stdin. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two, with each test case containing two inputs: two binary strings of length `n`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2.
