Output State: **`a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings of length n, `_` is 2**

The loop will execute twice, appending two binary strings to the list `a`. After the loop finishes, `a` will contain two binary strings of length `n`, and the state of `n` and stdin will remain unchanged. The variable `_` will be 2, indicating that the loop has executed twice.
