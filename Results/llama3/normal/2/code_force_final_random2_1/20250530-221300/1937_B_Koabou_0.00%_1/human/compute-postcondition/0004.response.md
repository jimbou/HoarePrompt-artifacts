Output State: **`a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two inputs: two binary strings of length n, `_` is 2**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains two binary strings of length `n`, where `n` is still equal to the first input from stdin. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The stdin now contains one less test case, with each test case still containing two inputs: two binary strings of length n.
