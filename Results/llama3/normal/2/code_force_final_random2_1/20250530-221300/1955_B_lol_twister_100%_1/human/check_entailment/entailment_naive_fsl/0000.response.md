Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the rules for constructing a progressive square and checks if the given array elements can form such a square.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first finds the minimum element in the array, which is assumed to be the top-left element of the progressive square (a_{1,1}).
2. It then constructs the progressive square by iterating over the rows and columns, calculating the value of each element using the formula a + k \* c + d \* h, where a is the top-left element, k is the row index, c is the row increment, h is the column index, and d is the column increment.
3. The program sorts the constructed progressive square and the given array, and then checks if they are equal. If they are, it returns "yes", indicating that the array elements can form a progressive square with the given parameters. Otherwise, it returns "no".

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the array elements can form a progressive square with the given parameters.
* When the array elements cannot form a progressive square with the given parameters.
* When the array is empty or contains only one element.
* When the parameters n, c, and d are invalid (e.g., n is not a positive integer, c or d is not a non-negative integer).

Overall, the program is correct and accurately solves the problem.
