Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `l[i]` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `a` is an integer equal to the smallest value in `l`, `li` is a list containing three elements: `a`, `a + d`, and `a + d * 2`, `k` is 0, `h` is 2**

The code appends a new element to the list `li`, which is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. Since `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a + d * 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
