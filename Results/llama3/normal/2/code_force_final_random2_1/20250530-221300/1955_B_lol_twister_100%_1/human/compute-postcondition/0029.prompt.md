Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, a is an integer equal to the smallest value in l, li is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for k in range(0, n):
    for h in range(0, n):
        li.append(a + k * c + d * h)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `l[i]` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `a` is an integer equal to the smallest value in `l`, `li` is a list containing `n` elements: `a`, `a + d`, `a + d * 2`, ..., `a + d * (n - 1)`, `k` is 0, `h` is `n - 1`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `li` will contain `n` elements, each of which is the smallest value in the list `l` plus a multiple of `d`, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 for each iteration. The other variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `l[i]` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `a` is an integer equal to the smallest value in `l`, `li` is a list containing `2n` elements: `a`, `a + d`, `a + d * 2`, ..., `a + d * (n - 1)`, `a + c + d * 0`, `a + c + d * 1`, ..., `a + c + d * (n - 1)`, `k` is 1, `h` is `n - 1`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. In each iteration, it appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + c + d * h`, where `a` is the smallest value in the list `l`, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `h` is the current iteration number, ranging from 0 to `n - 1`.

After the loop finishes executing, the list `li` contains `2n` elements: the original `n` elements, which are the multiples of `d` starting from `a`, and the additional `n` elements, which are the multiples of `d` starting from `a + c`.

The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, and `a` remain unchanged throughout the loop, as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The variable `k` remains constant at 1, and the variable `h` takes on the value of `n - 1` after the loop finishes executing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `l[i]` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `a` is an integer equal to the smallest value in `l`, `li` is a list containing `3n` elements: `a`, `a + d`, `a + d * 2`, ..., `a + d * (n - 1)`, `a + c + d * 0`, `a + c + d * 1`, ..., `a + c + d * (n - 1)`, `a + 2c`, `a + 2c + d`, ..., `a + 2c + d * (n - 1)`, `k` is 2, `h` is `n - 1`.

This output state indicates that the loop has executed `n` times, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. The list `li` now contains `3n` elements, which includes the initial `2n` elements and an additional `n` elements that were appended in each iteration of the loop. The value of `h` has also been updated to `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
