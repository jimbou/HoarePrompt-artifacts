Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c and d are integers greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i.
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `l[i]` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `a` is an integer equal to the smallest value in `l`, `li` is a list containing `n^2` elements: `a`, `a + d`, `a + d * 2`, ..., `a + d * (n - 1)`, `a + c + d * 0`, `a + c + d * 1`, ..., `a + c + d * (n - 1)`, `a + 2c`, `a + 2c + d`, ..., `a + 2c + d * (n - 1)`, ..., `a + (n - 1)c`, `a + (n - 1)c + d`, ..., `a + (n - 1)c + d * (n - 1)`, `k` is `n - 1`, `h` is `n - 1`.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:
    #
    #The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. In each iteration, it appends a new set of `n` elements to the list `li`. The new elements are calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `a` is the smallest value in the list `l`, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the current iteration number, ranging from 0 to `n - 1`, and `h` is the current iteration number, ranging from 0 to `n - 1`.
    #
    #After the loop finishes executing, the list `li` contains `n^2` elements, which are the multiples of `d` starting from `a`, `a + c`, `a + 2c`, ..., `a + (n - 1)c`. The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, and `a` remain unchanged throughout the loop, as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The variable `k` remains constant at `n - 1`, and the variable `h` takes on the value of `n - 1` after the loop finishes executing.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns the string 'yes'.
    #State: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, a is the smallest value in l, li is a sorted list containing n^2 elements: a, a + d, a + d * 2, ..., a + d * (n - 1), a + c, a + c + d, ..., a + c + d * (n - 1), ..., a + (n - 1)c, a + (n - 1)c + d, ..., a + (n - 1)c + d * (n - 1), k is n - 1, h is n - 1, and l is not equal to li
    return 'no'
    #The program returns the string 'no'
