Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `l[i]` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `a` is an integer equal to the smallest value in `l`, `li` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `a`, `a + d`, `a + d * 2`, ..., `a + d * (n - 1)`, `a + c + d * 0`, `k` is 1, `h` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the list `li` has been updated by appending a new element `a + k * c + d * h`, which is equal to `a + c` since `k` is 1 and `h` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
