#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c and d are integers greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i.
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):

    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `l[i]` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `a` is an integer equal to the smallest value in `l`, `li` is a list containing `n^2` elements: `a`, `a + d`, `a + d * 2`, ..., `a + d * (n - 1)`, `a + c + d * 0`, `a + c + d * 1`, ..., `a + c + d * (n - 1)`, `a + 2c`, `a + 2c + d`, ..., `a + 2c + d * (n - 1)`, ..., `a + (n - 1)c`, `a + (n - 1)c + d`, ..., `a + (n - 1)c + d * (n - 1)`, `k` is `n - 1`, `h` is `n - 1`.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:
    #
    #The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. In each iteration, it appends a new set of `n` elements to the list `li`. The new elements are calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `a` is the smallest value in the list `l`, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the current iteration number, ranging from 0 to `n - 1`, and `h` is the current iteration number, ranging from 0 to `n - 1`.
    #
    #After the loop finishes executing, the list `li` contains `n^2` elements, which are the multiples of `d` starting from `a`, `a + c`, `a + 2c`, ..., `a + (n - 1)c`. The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, and `a` remain unchanged throughout the loop, as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The variable `k` remains constant at `n - 1`, and the variable `h` takes on the value of `n - 1` after the loop finishes executing.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns the string 'yes'.
    #State: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, a is the smallest value in l, li is a sorted list containing n^2 elements: a, a + d, a + d * 2, ..., a + d * (n - 1), a + c, a + c + d, ..., a + c + d * (n - 1), ..., a + (n - 1)c, a + (n - 1)c + d, ..., a + (n - 1)c + d * (n - 1), k is n - 1, h is n - 1, and l is not equal to li
    return 'no'
    #The program returns the string 'no'

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes as input a list of n^2 integers and three integers n, c, and d, where n is greater than or equal to 2, and c and d are greater than or equal to 1. It calculates a new list of n^2 integers by adding multiples of c and d to the smallest value in the input list, sorts both lists, and then compares them. If the two sorted lists are equal, the function returns 'yes', otherwise it returns 'no'.
