Functionality: **This function takes as input a list of n^2 integers and three integers n, c, and d, where n is greater than or equal to 2, and c and d are greater than or equal to 1. It calculates a new list of n^2 integers by adding multiples of c and d to the smallest value in the input list, sorts both lists, and then compares them. If the two sorted lists are equal, the function returns 'yes', otherwise it returns 'no'.**
