Output State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `l[i]` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `a` is an integer equal to the smallest value in `l`, `li` is a list containing `2*n` elements: `a`, `a + d`, `a + d * 2`, ..., `a + d * (n - 1)`, `a + c + d * 0`, `a + c + d * 1`, ..., `a + c + d * (n - 1)`, `k` is 1, `h` is `n - 1`.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the list `li` has been extended to include `n` additional elements, each of the form `a + c + d * h`, where `h` ranges from 0 to `n - 1`. The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `h` is updated to `n - 1` after the loop finishes executing.
