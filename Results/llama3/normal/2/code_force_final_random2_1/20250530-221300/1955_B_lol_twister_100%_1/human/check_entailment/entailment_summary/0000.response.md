Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square and checks if the given array elements can form such a square.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the input values of n, c, and d, and the array b of n^2 integers.
2. It then calculates the value of a_{1,1} (the smallest value in the array) and constructs the progressive square according to the given rules.
3. The program sorts both the constructed progressive square and the input array.
4. It then compares the two sorted lists. If they are equal, it means that the input array elements can form a progressive square with the given values of n, c, and d, and the program returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of sorting to compare the two lists is also correct, as it allows the program to efficiently check if the input array elements can form a progressive square.

Correctness: **True**
