To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variable `h` in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `h` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `h` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `h` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `l[i]` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `a` is an integer equal to the smallest value in `l`, `li` is a list containing `2n+2` elements: `a`, `a + d`, `a + d * 2`, ..., `a + d * (n - 1)`, `a + c + d * 0`, `a + c + d * 1`, ..., `a + c + d * (n - 1)`, `a + 2c`, `a + 2c + d`, `k` is 2, `h` is 2**
