Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `l[i]` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `a` is an integer equal to the smallest value in `l`, `li` is a list containing two elements: `a` and `a + d`, `k` is 0, `h` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `li` has been updated to include a new element, which is `a + d`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `li` now contains two elements: the smallest value in `l` (which is `a`) and the result of the expression `a + d`.
