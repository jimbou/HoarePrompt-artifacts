The only variable in the loop head is variable `h`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h` and `n`. If `h` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `h` must be increased by 1, so `h` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `l[i]` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `a` is an integer equal to the smallest value in `l`, `li` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `a`, `a + d`, `a + d * 2`, ..., `a + d * (n - 1)`, `a + c + d * 0`, `k` is 1, `h` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
