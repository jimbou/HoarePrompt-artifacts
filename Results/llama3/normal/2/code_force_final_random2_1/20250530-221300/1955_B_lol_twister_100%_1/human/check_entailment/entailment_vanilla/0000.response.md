Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given array of integers can be rearranged into a progressive square based on the provided rules. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the size of the square `n`, and the values of `c` and `d`. These values are used to construct the progressive square.
3.  The program then reads the array of integers `l` that Maxim found.
4.  The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. This function is responsible for determining whether the array `l` can be rearranged into a progressive square.
5.  Inside `func_1`, the minimum value `a` is found in the array `l`. This value is used as the starting point for constructing the progressive square.
6.  The program then constructs the progressive square by iterating over each row and column, calculating the value at each position using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`, where `k` is the row index and `h` is the column index. These values are stored in the list `li`.
7.  The list `li` is then sorted in ascending order.
8.  The original array `l` is also sorted in ascending order.
9.  The program then compares the sorted list `li` with the sorted array `l`. If they are equal, it means that the array `l` can be rearranged into a progressive square, and the function returns `'yes'`. Otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly constructs the progressive square based on the provided rules and compares it with the given array to determine whether it can be rearranged into a progressive square.

Correctness: **True**
