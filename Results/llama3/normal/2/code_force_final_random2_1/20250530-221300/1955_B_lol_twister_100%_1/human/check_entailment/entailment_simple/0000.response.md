Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square and checks if the given array elements can form a progressive square for the given n, c, and d.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the input values of n, c, and d, and the array elements.
2. It then calculates the value of a, which is the smallest value in the array.
3. The program constructs the list li by iterating over the rows and columns of the progressive square, calculating the values of each element using the formula a + k * c + d * h, where k is the row number and h is the column number.
4. The program sorts both the array elements and the constructed list li.
5. It then checks if the sorted array elements are equal to the sorted constructed list li. If they are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that the array elements can form a progressive square for the given n, c, and d. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square and checks if the given array elements can form a progressive square for the given n, c, and d. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
