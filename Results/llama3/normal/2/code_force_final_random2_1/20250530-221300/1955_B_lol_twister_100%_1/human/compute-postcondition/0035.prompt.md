You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c and d are integers greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i.
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `l[i]` <= 10^9 for all `i`, `a` is an integer equal to the smallest value in `l`, `li` is a list containing `n^2` elements: `a`, `a + d`, `a + d * 2`, ..., `a + d * (n - 1)`, `a + c + d * 0`, `a + c + d * 1`, ..., `a + c + d * (n - 1)`, `a + 2c`, `a + 2c + d`, ..., `a + 2c + d * (n - 1)`, ..., `a + (n - 1)c`, `a + (n - 1)c + d`, ..., `a + (n - 1)c + d * (n - 1)`, `k` is `n - 1`, `h` is `n - 1`.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:
    #
    #The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. In each iteration, it appends a new set of `n` elements to the list `li`. The new elements are calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `a` is the smallest value in the list `l`, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the current iteration number, ranging from 0 to `n - 1`, and `h` is the current iteration number, ranging from 0 to `n - 1`.
    #
    #After the loop finishes executing, the list `li` contains `n^2` elements, which are the multiples of `d` starting from `a`, `a + c`, `a + 2c`, ..., `a + (n - 1)c`. The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, and `a` remain unchanged throughout the loop, as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The variable `k` remains constant at `n - 1`, and the variable `h` takes on the value of `n - 1` after the loop finishes executing.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns the string 'yes'.
    #State: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, a is the smallest value in l, li is a sorted list containing n^2 elements: a, a + d, a + d * 2, ..., a + d * (n - 1), a + c, a + c + d, ..., a + c + d * (n - 1), ..., a + (n - 1)c, a + (n - 1)c + d, ..., a + (n - 1)c + d * (n - 1), k is n - 1, h is n - 1, and l is not equal to li
    return 'no'
    #The program returns the string 'no'

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string 'yes'.

Case_2: The program returns the string 'no'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
