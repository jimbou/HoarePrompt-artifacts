Output State: **`x` is 4, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + y) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + y) * y)` for each `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 9 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `y` is the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. The value of `cnt` is still increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + y) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + y) * y)` for each `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `y` remain the same, and the stdin still contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m`.
