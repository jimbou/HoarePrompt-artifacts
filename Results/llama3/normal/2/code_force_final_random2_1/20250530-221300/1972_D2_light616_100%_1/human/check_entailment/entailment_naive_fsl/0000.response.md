Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conditions specified in the problem description. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

In `func_1`, the program iterates over all possible values of x and y such that (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m. It then checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and y is 1. If it is, the program increments the count by the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y). This is because the gcd of a and b is x, and the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions is the minimum of the number of multiples of (x + y) * x in n and the number of multiples of (x + y) * y in m.

In `func_2`, the program reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where n or m is 1. The use of the gcd function from the math module ensures that the program accurately calculates the greatest common divisor of x and y.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately implements the conditions specified in the problem description.
