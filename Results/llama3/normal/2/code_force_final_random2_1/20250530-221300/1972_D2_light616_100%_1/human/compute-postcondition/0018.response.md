The only variable in the loop head is variable x and n, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables x and n.  If x * x is less than or equal to n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 2, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6. For the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than or equal to 4 and x must be 2.
State: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + y) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + y) * y)` for each `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `y` is the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6**
