Output State: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 2) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 2) * 2)`, `n` must be at least 8, `m` must be at least 8, `y` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains 2, the value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 8` and `m // 8`, the value of `n` is still at least 8, the value of `m` is still at least 8, and the value of `y` remains 2.
