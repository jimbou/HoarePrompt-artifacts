Output State: **`x` is 1, `n` is at least 4 and a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` is at least 12 and a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `y` is 3, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + 3) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + 3) * 3)`, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 4` and `m // 12`, `stdin` contains t-3 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been increased by the minimum of `n // 4` and `m // 12`, which is the result of the expression `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`. The values of `x`, `n`, `m`, and `y` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.
