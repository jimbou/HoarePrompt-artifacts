The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `y` was 2, so the new value of `y` is 3. The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The conditions that `n` must be at least 8 and `m` must be at least 8 are still valid.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)`, `n` is at least 8, `m` is at least 8, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 2) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 2) * 2) because the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.**
