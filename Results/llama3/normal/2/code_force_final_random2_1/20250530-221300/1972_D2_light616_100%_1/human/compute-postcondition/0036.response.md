Output State: **x is 3, cnt is increased by the minimum of n // ((2 + y) * 2) and m // ((2 + y) * y) for each y from 2 to the maximum value of y such that (2 + y) * 2 <= n and (2 + y) * y <= m, n is a positive integer greater than 9 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, y is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers n and m, where n and m are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.**

In this output state, the value of y has been changed to 1. The values of x, cnt, n, and m remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two positive integers n and m.
