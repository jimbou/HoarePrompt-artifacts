Output State: **x is 3, cnt is increased by the minimum of n // ((2 + y) * 2) and m // ((2 + y) * y) for each y from 2 to the maximum value of y such that (2 + y) * 2 <= n and (2 + y) * y <= m, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, y is the maximum value of y such that (2 + y) * 2 <= n and (2 + y) * y <= m, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers n and m, where n and m are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of x has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The value of cnt remains the same, which is the sum of the minimum of n // ((2 + y) * 2) and m // ((2 + y) * y) for each y from 2 to the maximum value of y such that (2 + y) * 2 <= n and (2 + y) * y <= m. The values of n, m, and y remain the same, and the stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two positive integers n and m.
