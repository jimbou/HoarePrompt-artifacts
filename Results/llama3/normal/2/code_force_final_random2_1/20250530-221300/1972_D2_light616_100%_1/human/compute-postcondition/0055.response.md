Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains a positive integer t, and each of the following t lines contains two positive integers n and m. It calculates the total count of pairs of numbers (x, y) that satisfy the conditions (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m for each pair of input integers n and m, and prints this count. The function iterates through all possible values of x and y, checking if the greatest common divisor of x and y is 1, and increments the count by the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y) for each valid pair. The function repeats this process for t pairs of input integers.**
