Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), a function named `func_1` has been called and returned None, and the function call has no effect on the state as it returns None.**

The code calls the function `func_1()`, but since this function returns None and has no effect on the state, the output state remains the same as the initial state. The values of `t`, `_`, and the contents of stdin are unchanged.
