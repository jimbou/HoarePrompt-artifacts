According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`. For the loop to execute again, the following conditions must be met:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 3, `y` is 3, `n` is at least 12 and greater than `(3 + 2) * 3`, and `m` is at least 4 and greater than `(3 + 2) * 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the states of `n` and `m` to satisfy the conditions above.

1. For the first condition, `(x + y) * x <= n`, we need `n` to be greater than or equal to `(3 + 3) * 3 = 18`.
2. For the second condition, `(x + y) * y <= m`, we need `m` to be greater than or equal to `(3 + 3) * 3 = 18`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is 3, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((3 + 2) * 3)` and `m // ((3 + 2) * 2)` if `x` and `y` are coprime, otherwise no change is made, `n` must be at least 18, `m` must be at least 18, `y` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`.**
