Output State: **`x` is 3, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((3 + 3) * 3)` and `m // ((3 + 3) * 3)` since `x` and `y` are coprime, `n` must be at least 18, `m` must be at least 18, `y` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 18` and `m // 18` since `x` and `y` are coprime. The values of `x`, `n`, `m`, and `y` remain the same. The stdin now contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`.
