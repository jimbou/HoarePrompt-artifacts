Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a specific problem, which involves counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` reads input from stdin, where the first line contains a positive integer t, and each of the following t lines contains two positive integers n and m. It calculates the total count of pairs of numbers (x, y) that satisfy the conditions (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m for each pair of input integers n and m, and prints this count.

`func_2` reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m, and calls `func_1` t times.

The problem description states that the program should calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The program correctly implements this logic in `func_1`. It iterates through all possible values of x and y, checks if the greatest common divisor of x and y is 1, and increments the count by the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y) for each valid pair.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. `func_2` reads the input from stdin and calls `func_1` the correct number of times.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
