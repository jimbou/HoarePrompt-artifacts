To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved accordingly. The loop head is:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

The variables involved in the loop head are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`. Given the initial states:

- `x` is 3
- `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + y) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + y) * y)` for each `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 9 and less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`
- `m` is a positive integer less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`
- `y` is 1
- `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to satisfy both conditions in the loop head:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`

Given `x = 3` and `y = 1`, we substitute these values into the conditions:

1. `(3 + 1) * 3 <= n` simplifies to `12 <= n`
2. `(3 + 1) * 1 <= m` simplifies to `4 <= m`

Since `n` is already defined as greater than 9 and less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`, and `m` is less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 12 and `m` is at least 4 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

- `x` is 3
- `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + y) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + y) * y)` for each `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`
- `n` must be at least 12 and less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`
- `m` must be at least 4 and less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`
- `y` is 1
- `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`

State: **`x` is 3, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + y) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + y) * y)` for each `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, `n` must be at least 12 and less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`, `m` must be at least 4 and less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`, `y` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`**
