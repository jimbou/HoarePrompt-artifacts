Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b.

Function 1 (`func_1`) reads input from stdin, where the first line contains a positive integer t, and each of the following t lines contains two positive integers n and m. It calculates the total count of pairs of numbers (x, y) that satisfy the conditions (x + y) * x ≤ n and (x + y) * y ≤ m for each pair of input integers n and m, and prints this count.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m, and calls `func_1` t times, without modifying the input or producing any output.

The execution summaries suggest that `func_1` is responsible for calculating the count of valid pairs for each test case, and `func_2` is responsible for reading the input and calling `func_1` for each test case.

Since `func_1` correctly calculates the count of valid pairs for each test case, and `func_2` correctly reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, the program as a whole correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
