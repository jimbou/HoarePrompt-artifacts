Output State: **x is 1, cnt is increased by the minimum of n // ((1 + y) * 1) and m // ((1 + y) * y) for each y from 2 to the maximum value of y such that (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, y is the maximum value of y such that (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers n and m, where n and m are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed until the condition `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` is no longer satisfied. The value of `cnt` has been incremented by the minimum of `n // ((1 + y) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + y) * y)` for each value of `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` that satisfies the condition. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the value of `y` is the maximum value that satisfies the condition. The input in `stdin` remains the same.
