To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved accordingly. The loop head is:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
```

The variables in the loop head are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`. Given the state right before the loop:

- `x` is 2
- `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + y) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + y) * y)` for each `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6
- `m` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6
- `y` is 1
- stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to guarantee that the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are met.

Given `x` is 2 and `y` is 1, we have:
- `(x + y) * x = (2 + 1) * 2 = 6`
- `(x + y) * y = (2 + 1) * 1 = 3`

For the loop to execute, we need:
- `6 <= n`
- `3 <= m`

Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, the condition `6 <= n` is inherently satisfied for any `n` that is 6 or greater. However, to ensure the loop can execute, we should explicitly state that `n` must be at least 6.

For `m`, since it is less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, and we need `3 <= m`, this condition is also inherently satisfied for any positive `m`. However, to be precise, we should state that `m` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the adjusted states to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed are:

State: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + y) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + y) * y)` for each `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, `n` must be at least 6 and is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` must be at least 3 and is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `y` is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6**
