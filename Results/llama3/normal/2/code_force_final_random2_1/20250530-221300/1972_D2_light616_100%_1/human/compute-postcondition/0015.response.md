The value of `y` is incremented by 1, so `y` is now 4. The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is now 1. The value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + 4) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + 4) * 4)`, and then `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 5` and `m // 20`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since `stdin` contains t-3 lines of input, it now contains t-2 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `n` is at least 4 and a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` is at least 12 and a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `y` is 4, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 5` and `m // 20` plus the minimum of `n // 5` and `m // 20`, and `stdin` contains t-2 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.**
