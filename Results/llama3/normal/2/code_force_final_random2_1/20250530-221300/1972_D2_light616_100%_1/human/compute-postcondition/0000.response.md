The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) first and that integer is assigned into t. So stdin now contains t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). The value of t is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6)**
