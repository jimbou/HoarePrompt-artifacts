According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`. If `(x + y) * x` is less than or equal to `n` and `(x + y) * y` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 3, `y` is 2, `n` is at least 12 and less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`, and `m` is at least 4 and less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`. Since `x` and `y` are coprime, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 3) * 3)` and `m // ((2 + 3) * 2)`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the values of `n` and `m` to be greater than or equal to the minimum required values.

State: **`x` is 3, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + y) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + y) * y)` for each `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, `n` must be at least 12 and greater than `(x + y) * x`, `m` must be at least 4 and greater than `(x + y) * y`, `y` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`.**
