Output State: **x is 2, cnt is increased by the minimum of n // ((2 + y) * 2) and m // ((2 + y) * y) for each y from 2 to the maximum value of y such that (2 + y) * 2 <= n and (2 + y) * y <= m, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, y is the maximum value of y such that (2 + y) * 2 <= n and (2 + y) * y <= m, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers n and m, where n and m are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `x` remains 2, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + y) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + y) * y)` for each `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `y` is the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, and stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.
