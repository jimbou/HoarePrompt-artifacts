Output State: **`x` is 3, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((3 + 2) * 3)` and `m // ((3 + 2) * 2)`, `n` must be at least 12 and greater than `(3 + 2) * 3`, `m` must be at least 4 and greater than `(3 + 2) * 2`, `y` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains 3, the value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 15` and `m // 10`, where `n` is at least 12 and greater than 15, and `m` is at least 4 and greater than 10. The value of `y` remains 2. The `stdin` still contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`.
