Postcondition: ***`x` is 3, `y` is 3, `n` is at least 18, `m` is at least 18, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`. If `x` and `y` are coprime, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((3 + 2) * 3)` and `m // ((3 + 2) * 2)`.***
