Output State: **`x` is 3, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((3 + 2) * 3)` and `m // ((3 + 2) * 2)` if `x` and `y` are coprime, otherwise no change is made. `n` must be at least 12 and greater than `(3 + 2) * 3`, `m` must be at least 4 and greater than `(3 + 2) * 2`, `y` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `x` remains 3, `cnt` is updated based on the coprimality of `x` and the new value of `y`, which is now 3. The conditions on `n` and `m` remain the same, and `y` is incremented to 3. The input in `stdin` remains unchanged, with `t-1` lines of input, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m`.
