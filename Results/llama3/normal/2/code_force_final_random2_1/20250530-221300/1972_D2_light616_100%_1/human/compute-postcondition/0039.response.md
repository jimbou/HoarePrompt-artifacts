Output State: **`x` is 3, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 3) * 3)` and `m // ((2 + 3) * 1)`, `n` must be at least 12 and less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`, `m` must be at least 4 and less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`, `y` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`. The current value of `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 15` and `m // 5`, where `n` and `m` are the current input values from `stdin`. The values of `x` and `y` remain the same, and the coprime relationship between `x` and `y` is still valid. The input values `n` and `m` are still constrained to be within the specified ranges, and there are still `t-1` lines of input left in `stdin`.
