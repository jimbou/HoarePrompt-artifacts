Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), a function named `func_1` has been called and returned None**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t` lines, each with two positive integers `n` and `m`. The function `func_1` has been executed, but since its implementation is not provided, we assume it does not modify any variables or stdin. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `func_1` has been called and returned None.
