To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the while loop statement and adjust the states of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` accordingly.

The conditions for the loop to execute are:
1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`

Given the states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is 2
- `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)`
- `n` must be at least 6 and is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6
- `m` must be at least 3 and is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6
- `y` is 2
- stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6
- The current value of `x` and `y` are coprime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1, only if `x` and `y` are coprime. Otherwise, no operation is performed.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states so that both conditions are met.

1. For `(x + y) * x <= n`, given `x` is 2 and `y` is 2, we have `(2 + 2) * 2 <= n`, which simplifies to `8 <= n`. Since `n` must be at least 6, we need to ensure `n` is at least 8 for this condition to be true in the next iteration.

2. For `(x + y) * y <= m`, with `x` as 2 and `y` as 2, we get `(2 + 2) * 2 <= m`, simplifying to `8 <= m`. Given `m` must be at least 3, we need to ensure `m` is at least 8 for this condition to hold in the next iteration.

The state of `cnt` and the fact that `x` and `y` are coprime do not directly affect the loop conditions, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again. Similarly, the contents of stdin do not affect the loop conditions directly.

Therefore, the adjusted states to ensure the loop can execute one more time are:
- `x` is 2
- `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)`
- `n` must be at least 8 and is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6
- `m` must be at least 8 and is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6
- `y` is 2
- stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6
- The current value of `x` and `y` are coprime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1, only if `x` and `y` are coprime. Otherwise, no operation is performed.

State: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)`, `n` must be at least 8, `m` must be at least 8, `y` is 2**
