Output State: **`x` is 1, `n` is at least 3 and a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` is at least 6 and a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `y` is 3, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + 3) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + 3) * 3)`, `stdin` contains t-2 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. Since the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + 3) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + 3) * 3)`. The values of `x`, `n`, `m`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
