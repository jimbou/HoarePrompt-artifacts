Output State: **`x` is 3, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + y) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + y) * y)` for each `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, `n` must be at least 12 and less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`, `m` must be at least 4 and less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`, `y` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`. If the current value of `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), then `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 3) * 3)` and `m // ((2 + 3) * 2)**.

The value of `y` is incremented by 1, so `y` is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `cnt` to be increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 3) * 3)` and `m // ((2 + 3) * 1)` is no longer applicable since `x` and `y` are not coprime (their greatest common divisor is not 1).
