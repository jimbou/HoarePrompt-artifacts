The only variable in the loop head is variable x and n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and n.  If x * x is less than or equal to n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 3, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6. So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 9.
State: **x is 3, cnt is increased by the minimum of n // ((2 + y) * 2) and m // ((2 + y) * y) for each y from 2 to the maximum value of y such that (2 + y) * 2 <= n and (2 + y) * y <= m, n is a positive integer greater than 9 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, y is the maximum value of y such that (2 + y) * 2 <= n and (2 + y) * y <= m, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers n and m, where n and m are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.**
