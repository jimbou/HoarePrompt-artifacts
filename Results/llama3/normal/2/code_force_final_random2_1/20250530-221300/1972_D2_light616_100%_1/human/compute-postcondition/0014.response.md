Postcondition: ***`x` is 1, `n` is at least 4 and a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` is at least 12 and a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `y` is 3. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + 3) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + 3) * 3)`, and then `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 4` and `m // 12`, and `stdin` contains t-3 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6. Otherwise, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + 3) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + 3) * 3)`, and `stdin` contains t-2 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.***
