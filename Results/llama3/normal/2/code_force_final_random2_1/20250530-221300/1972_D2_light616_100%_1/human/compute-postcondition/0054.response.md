Output: **x is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, cnt is increased by the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y) for each y from 1 to the maximum value of y such that (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to x^2 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, y is the maximum value of y such that (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers n and m, where n and m are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, and cnt is printed, cnt (where cnt is the total count of the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y) for each y from 1 to the maximum value of y such that (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m)**
