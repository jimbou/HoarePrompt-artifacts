To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. Since `t` is at least 1, it must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), a function named `func_1` has been called and returned None, and the function call has no effect on the state as it returns None.**
