Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The given program uses a brute force approach to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and checks if they satisfy the conditions.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case, and `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
2. In `func_1`, the program initializes variables `x` and `cnt`. `x` is used to iterate over possible values of `x` in the equation `(x + y) * x <= n`, and `cnt` is used to store the count of valid pairs.
3. The program reads the values of `n` and `m` from the input.
4. The program uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y`. The outer loop iterates over `x` from 1 to √n, and the inner loop iterates over `y` from 1 to a value that satisfies the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
5. Inside the inner loop, the program checks if `gcd(x, y)` is equal to 1. If it is, the program increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. This is because the number of valid pairs for a given `x` and `y` is equal to the minimum of the number of multiples of `(x + y) * x` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of multiples of `(x + y) * y` in the range `[1, m]`.
6. After the nested loop finishes, the program prints the value of `cnt`.

The program seems to be correct, as it iterates over all possible pairs (a, b) and checks if they satisfy the conditions. The use of `gcd` to check if `x` and `y` are coprime is also correct.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The program uses a brute force approach, which may not be efficient for large values of `n` and `m`. The program has a time complexity of O(√n * m), which may be too slow for large inputs.

Despite this potential issue, the program is correct in terms of its logic and algorithm.

Correctness: **True**
