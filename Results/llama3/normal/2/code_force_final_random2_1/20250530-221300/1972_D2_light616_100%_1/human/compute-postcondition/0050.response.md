Output State: **x is 3, cnt is increased by the minimum of n // ((2 + y) * 2) and m // ((2 + y) * y) for each y from 2 to the maximum value of y such that (2 + y) * 2 <= n and (2 + y) * y <= m, n is a positive integer greater than 9 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, m is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, y is the maximum value of y such that (2 + y) * 2 <= n and (2 + y) * y <= m, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers n and m, where n and m are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being the value of y. The loop continues to execute as long as the conditions (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m are met, and in each iteration, the value of y is incremented by 1. The loop stops when these conditions are no longer met, and the final value of y is the maximum value such that (2 + y) * 2 <= n and (2 + y) * y <= m. The values of x, n, m, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
