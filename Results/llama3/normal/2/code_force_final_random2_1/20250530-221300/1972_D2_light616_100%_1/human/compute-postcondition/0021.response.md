Postcondition: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + y) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + y) * y)` for each `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, `n` must be at least 6 and is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` must be at least 3 and is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `y` is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6. The current value of `x` and `y` are coprime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1.**
