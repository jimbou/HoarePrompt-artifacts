Postcondition: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)`, `n` must be at least 8, `m` must be at least 8, `y` is 2. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 2) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 2) * 2)`.**
