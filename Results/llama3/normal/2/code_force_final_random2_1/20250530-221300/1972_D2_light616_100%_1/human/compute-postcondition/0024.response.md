Output State: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)`, `n` must be at least 6 and is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` must be at least 3 and is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `y` is 2, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6. The current value of `x` and `y` are coprime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1, only if `x` and `y` are coprime. Otherwise, no operation is performed.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `y` being 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n` and `m` are still valid. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m`. The coprime condition between `x` and `y` is still applicable, but since `x` is 2 and `y` is 2, they are not coprime, so no operation is performed.
