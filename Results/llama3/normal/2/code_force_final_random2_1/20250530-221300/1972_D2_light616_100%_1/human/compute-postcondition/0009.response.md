Output State: **`x` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + 2) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + 2) * 2)`, `n` is at least 3 and a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` is at least 6 and a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `y` is 2, `stdin` contains t-2 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains 1, the value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 3` and `m // 6`, the values of `n` and `m` are still positive integers less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, the value of `y` remains 2, and the stdin still contains t-2 lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m`.
