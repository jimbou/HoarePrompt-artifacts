Output State: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)`, `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)`, `n // ((2 + 2) * 2)`, `m // ((2 + 2) * 2)`, `n // ((2 + 3) * 2)`, and `m // ((2 + 3) * 3)`, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 15, `y` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains 2, the value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of six different divisions involving `n` and `m`, the value of `n` is still at least 10, the value of `m` is still at least 15, and the value of `y` remains 3.
