Output State: **`_` is `t`, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), a function named `func_1` has been called `t` times and returned None, and the function call has no effect on the state as it returns None.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop variable `_` will have reached the value of `t`, which is the number of iterations. The state of the input (stdin) remains unchanged, with `t` lines containing two positive integers `n` and `m` within the specified range. The function `func_1` has been called `t` times, but since it returns None, it has no effect on the state.
