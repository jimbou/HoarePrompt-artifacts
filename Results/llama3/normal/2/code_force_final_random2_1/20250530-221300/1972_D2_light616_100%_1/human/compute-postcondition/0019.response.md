Output State: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + y) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + y) * y)` for each `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `y` is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains 2. The value of `cnt` is still increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + y) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + y) * y)` for each `y` from 2 to the maximum value of `y` such that `(2 + y) * 2 <= n` and `(2 + y) * y <= m`. The values of `n` and `m` are still positive integers within the given ranges. The value of `y` is now 1. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` within the given ranges.
