Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 1, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), a function named `func_1` has been called and returned None, and the function call has no effect on the state as it returns None.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the function `func_1` does not modify any variables or have any side effects, and it returns None. The values of `t` and `_` remain the same, and the contents of stdin are unchanged.
