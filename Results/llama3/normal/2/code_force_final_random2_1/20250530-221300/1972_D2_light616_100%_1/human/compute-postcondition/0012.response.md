According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`. If `(x + y) * x` is less than or equal to `n` and `(x + y) * y` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `n` is at least 3 and a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, and `m` is at least 6 and a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to `(x + y) * x` which is `(1 + 3) * 1` which is 4 and `m` must be greater than or equal to `(x + y) * y` which is `(1 + 3) * 3` which is 12. So, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 12. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` is 1, `n` is at least 4 and a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` is at least 12 and a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `y` is 3, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + 3) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + 3) * 3)`, `stdin` contains t-2 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6**
