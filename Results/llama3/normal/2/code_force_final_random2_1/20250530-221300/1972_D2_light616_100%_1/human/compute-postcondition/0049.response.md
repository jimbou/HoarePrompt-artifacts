Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 4, `n` is at least 18, `m` is at least 18, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to `2 * 10^6`. If `x` and `y` are coprime, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((3 + 2) * 3)` and `m // ((3 + 2) * 2)`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `y` being 4. The values of `x`, `n`, `m`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The condition for increasing `cnt` is still dependent on whether `x` and `y` are coprime, and if they are, `cnt` will be increased by the minimum of `n // ((3 + 2) * 3)` and `m // ((3 + 2) * 2)`.
