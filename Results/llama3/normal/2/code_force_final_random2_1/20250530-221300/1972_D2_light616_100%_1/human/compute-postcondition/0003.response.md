The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _.  If the variable _ is less than t the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, t is at least 1, _ is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the variable _ is 1 and t is at least 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 1, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), a function named `func_1` has been called and returned None**
