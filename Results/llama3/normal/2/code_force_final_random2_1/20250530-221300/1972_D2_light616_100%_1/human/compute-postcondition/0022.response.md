Output State: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 1) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 1) * 1)`, `n` must be at least 6 and is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `m` must be at least 3 and is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, `y` is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: each line contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where `n` and `m` are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6. The current value of `x` and `y` are coprime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains 2, and the value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 6` and `m // 3`, where `n` and `m` are the current input values from stdin. The values of `n` and `m` are still constrained to be positive integers less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, and `y` remains 1. The coprime relationship between `x` and `y` is still maintained.
