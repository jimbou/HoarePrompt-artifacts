Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 2, a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp + x and the first integer in the list a and also the maximum of tmp and the previous value of t, _ is 1, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * t % MOD, i is at least 1, tmp is either 0 if tmp was originally negative, otherwise tmp is tmp + x.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been doubled and then taken modulo `MOD`, and this new value of `t` has been added to `ans`, which has also been taken modulo `MOD` to ensure it remains within the range defined by `MOD`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, retaining their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
