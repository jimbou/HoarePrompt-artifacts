Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 1, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is 0, tmp is x, _ is 1, ans is ((s + 2^k * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is k-1, and ans is printed, x is the first integer in the list a**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases T is at least 2, the modulus MOD is 1000000007, there are T-4 test cases left in the standard input, the number of elements n is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, the value of k is at least 1, the list a contains n integers with at least one integer, the sum of the integers in a is s, the value of t is 0, the value of tmp is now the first integer x in the list a, the value of _ is 1, the value of ans is still ((s + 2^k * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, the value of i is k-1, and the value of ans has been printed, and x is still the first integer in the list a.
