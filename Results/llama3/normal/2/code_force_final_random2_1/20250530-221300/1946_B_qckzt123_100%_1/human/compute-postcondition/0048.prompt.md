Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 1, a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is 0, tmp is 0, _ is 1, ans is ((s + 2^k * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is k-1, and ans is printed
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    tmp += x
    if tmp < 0:
        tmp = 0
    t = max(tmp, t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 1, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is either 0 or the first integer in the list a, _ is 1, ans is ((s + 2^k * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is k-1, and ans is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 1, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp and the first integer in the list a, _ is 1, ans is ((s + 2^k * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is k-1. If tmp is less than 0, tmp is set to 0. Otherwise, tmp is increased by the second integer in the list a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 1, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp + x and the first integer in the list a and also the maximum of tmp and the previous value of t, _ is 1, ans is ((s + 2^k * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is k-1, tmp is either 0 if tmp was originally negative, otherwise tmp is tmp + x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
