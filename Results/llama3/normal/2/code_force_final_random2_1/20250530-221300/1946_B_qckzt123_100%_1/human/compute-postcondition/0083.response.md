To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `k` is greater than 1, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-6 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k must be greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp and t multiplied by 2 and taken modulo MOD, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD plus t multiplied by 2 and taken modulo MOD, i is 1, x is the last element in the list a.**
