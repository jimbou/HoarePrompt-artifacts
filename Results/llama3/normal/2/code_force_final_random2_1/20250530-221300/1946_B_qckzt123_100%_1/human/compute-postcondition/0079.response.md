Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-6 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 1, a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp and t, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * t % MOD + t, i is n-1, x is the last element in the list a. If tmp is less than 0, then t is set to t. Otherwise, t remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `a`, and the variable `t` now holds the maximum value of `tmp` seen during the iterations. The variable `x` now holds the last element in the list `a`, and the variable `i` now holds the index of the last element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
