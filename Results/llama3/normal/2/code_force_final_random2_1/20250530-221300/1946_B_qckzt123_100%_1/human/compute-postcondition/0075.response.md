Output State: **`T` is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, `MOD` is 1000000007, `stdin` contains `T-6` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers and must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and `t`, `ans` is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * t % MOD + t, `i` is 1, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `tmp` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The values of `T`, `MOD`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, and `x` are still the same as in the initial state.
