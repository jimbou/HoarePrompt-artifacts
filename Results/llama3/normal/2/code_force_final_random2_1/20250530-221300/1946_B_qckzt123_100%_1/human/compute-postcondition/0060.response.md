Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-6 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 1, a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is 0, tmp is 0, _ is 2, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * t % MOD + t, i is 0**

In this output state, the value of T remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of MOD also remains the same. The stdin now contains T-6 test cases because two lines of input have been read. The value of n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, and the value of k is an integer and must be at least 1. The list a now contains n integers read from the input. The sum of the integers in a is stored in s. The variables t and tmp are initialized to 0. The value of _ remains 2, and the value of ans is calculated based on the values of s and t. The value of i remains 0.
