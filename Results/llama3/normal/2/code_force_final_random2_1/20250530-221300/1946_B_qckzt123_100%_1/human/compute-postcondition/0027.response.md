Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 1, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is 2^(k-1) times the maximum subarray sum of a modulo MOD, tmp is 0, _ is 0, ans is ((s + 2^k * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is k-1**

This output state represents the final state of the program after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop iterates k-1 times, and in each iteration, it doubles the value of t and adds it to ans. After the loop finishes, t will be 2^(k-1) times the maximum subarray sum of a modulo MOD, and ans will be the sum of s and 2^k times t modulo MOD. The other variables remain unchanged.
