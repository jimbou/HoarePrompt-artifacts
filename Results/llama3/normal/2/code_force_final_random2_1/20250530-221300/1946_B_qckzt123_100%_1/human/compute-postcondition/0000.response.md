Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

The first line assigns the value of 1000000007 to MOD. The second line reads the number of test cases from stdin and assigns it to T. Since T is an integer, it is now equal to the number of test cases. The value of MOD remains unchanged. Stdin now contains T-1 test cases, each with two lines. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
