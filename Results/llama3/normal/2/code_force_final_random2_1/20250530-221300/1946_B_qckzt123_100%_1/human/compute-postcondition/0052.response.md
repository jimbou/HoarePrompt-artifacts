The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is at least 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be at least 3.
State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 3, a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp + x and the first integer in the list a and also the maximum of tmp and the previous value of t, _ is 1, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * t % MOD, i is at least 2, tmp is either 0 if tmp was originally negative, otherwise tmp is tmp + x**
