To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `x` and the list `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least one more integer, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least one integer, and `x` is the last integer in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least one more integer, and `x` must be the next integer in the list.

State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 1, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is either 0 or the first integer in the list a, _ is 1, ans is ((s + 2^k * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is k-1, and ans is printed, x is the second integer in the list a**
