Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, `MOD` is 1000000007, `stdin` contains `T-6` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers and must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and 0, `ans` is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * t % MOD + t, `i` is 0, `x` is the second element in the list `a`. If `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` is increased by `x`.***
