Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between -10^9 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, x is the second integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of 0 and the second integer in the list, tmp is the second integer in the list if it is non-negative, otherwise tmp is 0, _ is 0**

The code increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`, which is the second integer in the list `a`. Since `tmp` is initially 0 if `x` is negative, otherwise `tmp` is `x`, the new value of `tmp` will be `x` if `x` is non-negative, otherwise `tmp` will remain 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
