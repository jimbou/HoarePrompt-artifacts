Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-6 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k must be greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp and t multiplied by 2 and taken modulo MOD, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD plus t multiplied by 2 and taken modulo MOD, i is 0, x is the last element in the list a.**

The code multiplies `t` by 2 and takes the result modulo `MOD`, then adds this new value of `t` to `ans` and takes the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `t` is updated to be the result of the multiplication and modulo operation, and the value of `ans` is updated to be the result of the addition and modulo operation. The other variables remain unchanged.
