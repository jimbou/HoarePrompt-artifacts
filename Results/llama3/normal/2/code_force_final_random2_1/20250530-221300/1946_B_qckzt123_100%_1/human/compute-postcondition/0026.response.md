Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 4, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is four times the maximum subarray sum of a modulo MOD, tmp is 0, _ is 0, ans is ((s + 8 * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is 2**

The code block modifies the value of `t` and `ans`. The first line doubles the value of `t`, and the second line takes the result modulo `MOD`. The third line adds the modified `t` to `ans`, and the fourth line takes the result modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.
