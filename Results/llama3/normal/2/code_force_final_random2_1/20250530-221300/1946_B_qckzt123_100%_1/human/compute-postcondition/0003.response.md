According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is 0, tmp is 0, _ is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the x is the first integer in the list.
State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between -10^9 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, x is the first integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is 0, tmp is 0, _ is 0**
