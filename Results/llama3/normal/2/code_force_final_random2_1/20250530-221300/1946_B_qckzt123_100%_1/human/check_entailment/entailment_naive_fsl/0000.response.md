Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when k is 0. In this case, the program should return the sum of the array modulo 10^9 + 7, but it does not. The program only handles the case when k is greater than 0.

For example, if the input is:

1
5 0
4 -2 8 -12 9

The program should return 17, but it does not.
