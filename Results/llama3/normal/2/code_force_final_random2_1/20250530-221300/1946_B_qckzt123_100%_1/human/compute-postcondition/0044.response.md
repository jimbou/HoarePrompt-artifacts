Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 1, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp + x and the first integer in the list a, _ is 1, ans is ((s + 2^k * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is k-1, tmp is tmp + x.**

In this output state, the value of tmp has been updated by adding the second integer x in the list a. The value of t is now the maximum of the updated tmp and the first integer in the list a. The values of the other variables remain the same.
