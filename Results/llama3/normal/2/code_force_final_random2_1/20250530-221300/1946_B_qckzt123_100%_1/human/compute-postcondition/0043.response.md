The only variable in the loop head is variable x and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list a has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp and the first integer in the list a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list a must have at least 2 integers and x is the second integer in the list a.
State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 1, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp and the first integer in the list a, _ is 1, ans is ((s + 2^k * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is k-1, x is the second integer in the list a**
