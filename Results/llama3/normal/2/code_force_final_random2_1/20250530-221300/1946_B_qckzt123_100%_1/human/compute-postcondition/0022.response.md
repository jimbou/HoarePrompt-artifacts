The code block modifies the values of `t` and `ans`. The first line doubles the value of `t`, and the second line takes the modulus of the new value of `t` with `MOD` (1000000007). The third line adds the modified value of `t` to `ans`, and the fourth line takes the modulus of the new value of `ans` with `MOD`.

Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 2, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is twice the maximum subarray sum of a modulo MOD, tmp is 0, _ is 0, ans is ((s + 2 * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is 0**
