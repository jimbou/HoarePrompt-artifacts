Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 1, a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp + x and the first integer in the list a and also the maximum of tmp and the previous value of t, _ is T-1, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * t % MOD + t, i is 0, tmp is either 0 if tmp was originally negative, otherwise tmp is tmp + x, t is 2 times the previous value of t modulo MOD, ans is the previous value of ans plus 2 times the previous value of t modulo MOD, and the value of ans is printed**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the variables have reached their final values. The loop counter `_` has reached `T-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `T` times. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `s`, `t`, `tmp`, and `ans` are the final values after the last iteration of the loop. The value of `ans` is printed, indicating that the loop has completed its execution.
