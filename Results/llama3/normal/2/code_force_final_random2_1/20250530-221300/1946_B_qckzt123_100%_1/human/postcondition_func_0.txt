This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. It calculates the sum of the integers, finds the maximum subarray sum, and then performs a series of calculations involving modular arithmetic to produce a final result, which is printed to the console. The function repeats this process for each test case.
