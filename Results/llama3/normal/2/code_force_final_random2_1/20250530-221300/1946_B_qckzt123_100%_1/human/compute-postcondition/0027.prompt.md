Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum subarray sum of a, tmp is 0, _ is 0, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k - 1):
    t *= 2
    t %= MOD
    ans += t
    ans %= MOD


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 2, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is twice the maximum subarray sum of a modulo MOD, tmp is 0, _ is 0, ans is ((s + 2 * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 3, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is twice the maximum subarray sum of a modulo MOD, tmp is 0, _ is 0, ans is ((s + 4 * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 4, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is four times the maximum subarray sum of a modulo MOD, tmp is 0, _ is 0, ans is ((s + 8 * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
