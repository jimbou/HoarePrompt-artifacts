The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 integers, x is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the x is the third integer in the list.
State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between -10^9 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, x is the third integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of 0 and the second integer in the list, tmp is the second integer in the list if it is non-negative, otherwise tmp is 0, _ is 0**
