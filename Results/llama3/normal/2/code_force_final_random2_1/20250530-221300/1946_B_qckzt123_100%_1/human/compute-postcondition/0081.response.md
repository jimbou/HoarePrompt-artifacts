To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, so it needs to be adjusted to `0` (the starting value of the range). `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, `MOD` is 1000000007, `stdin` contains `T-6` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and `t`, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 0, `x` is the last element in the list `a`.**
