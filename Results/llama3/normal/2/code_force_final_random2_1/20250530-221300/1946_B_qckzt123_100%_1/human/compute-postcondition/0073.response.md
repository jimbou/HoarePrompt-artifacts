The only object in the loop head is variable  x and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, x is the second element in the list, i is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the x is the third element in the list and i is 1.
State: **`T` is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, `MOD` is 1000000007, `stdin` contains `T-6` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers and must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and `t`, `ans` is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * t % MOD + t, `i` is 1, `x` is the third element in the list `a`.
