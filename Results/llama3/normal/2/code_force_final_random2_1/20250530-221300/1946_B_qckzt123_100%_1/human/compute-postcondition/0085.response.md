The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 3.
State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-6 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k must be greater than 3, a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp and t multiplied by 2 and taken modulo MOD, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD plus t multiplied by 2 and taken modulo MOD plus t multiplied by 2 and taken modulo MOD, i is 2, x is the last element in the list a.**
