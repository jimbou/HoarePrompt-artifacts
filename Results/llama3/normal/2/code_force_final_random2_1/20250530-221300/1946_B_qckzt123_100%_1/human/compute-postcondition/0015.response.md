Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between -10^9 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, x is the third integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of 0 and the second integer in the list, tmp is the sum of the second integer in the list if it is non-negative and the third integer in the list, otherwise tmp is the third integer in the list, _ is 0**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the variable tmp. The value of tmp is now the sum of its previous value (which was the second integer in the list if it was non-negative, otherwise 0) and the third integer in the list.
