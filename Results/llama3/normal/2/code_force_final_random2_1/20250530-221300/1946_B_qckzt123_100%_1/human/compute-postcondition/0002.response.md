Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between -10^9 and 10^9 inclusive, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is 0, tmp is 0, _ is 0**

The code reads two lines from stdin for a test case, assigning the values to `n`, `k`, and `a`. It then calculates the sum of the integers in `a` and assigns it to `s`. The variables `t` and `tmp` are initialized to 0. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
