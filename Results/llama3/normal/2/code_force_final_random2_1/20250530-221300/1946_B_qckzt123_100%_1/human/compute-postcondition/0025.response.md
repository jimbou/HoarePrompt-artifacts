To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(k - 1):`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k - 1`. Since `i` is 1, we can increment it by 1 to make it 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 2.

State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 4, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is twice the maximum subarray sum of a modulo MOD, tmp is 0, _ is 0, ans is ((s + 4 * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is 2**
