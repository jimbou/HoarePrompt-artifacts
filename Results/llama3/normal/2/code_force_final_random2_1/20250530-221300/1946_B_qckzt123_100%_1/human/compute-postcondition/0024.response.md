Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 3, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is twice the maximum subarray sum of a modulo MOD, tmp is 0, _ is 0, ans is ((s + 4 * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is 1**

The code multiplies `t` by 2 and then takes the modulus of the result with `MOD`. This effectively doubles the value of `t` while ensuring it remains within the range defined by `MOD`. The new value of `t` is then added to `ans`, and the result is again taken modulo `MOD` to keep `ans` within the same range. This operation does not affect any other variables.
