Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum subarray sum of a, tmp is 0, _ is 0**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list 'a' is empty, 'tmp' is 0, and 't' is the maximum subarray sum of the original list 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged.
