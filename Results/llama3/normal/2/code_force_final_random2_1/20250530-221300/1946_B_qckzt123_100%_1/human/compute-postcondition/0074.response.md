Output State: **`T` is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, `MOD` is 1000000007, `stdin` contains `T-6` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers and must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and `t`, `ans` is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * t % MOD + t, `i` is 1, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `tmp` is increased by the third element in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `T` is at least 2, the modulo value `MOD` is 1000000007, there are `T-6` test cases left in the input, the number of elements `n` is between 1 and 200000, the value of `k` is at least 1, the list `a` has at least 3 elements, the sum of the elements in `a` is `s`, the maximum of `tmp` and `t` is `t`, the answer `ans` is calculated based on `s`, `t`, and `MOD`, the loop counter `i` is 1, the variable `x` is the third element in the list `a`, and the temporary variable `tmp` is increased by the third element in the list `a`.
