According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `T` is at least 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 2 and `T` is at least 2.
State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-5 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 1, a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp + x and the first integer in the list a and also the maximum of tmp and the previous value of t, _ is 2, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * t % MOD + t, i is 0, tmp is either 0 if tmp was originally negative, otherwise tmp is tmp + x, t is 2 times the previous value of t modulo MOD, ans is the previous value of ans plus 2 times the previous value of t modulo MOD, and the value of ans is printed**
