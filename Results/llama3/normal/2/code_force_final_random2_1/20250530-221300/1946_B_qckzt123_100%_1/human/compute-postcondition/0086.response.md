Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-6 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k must be greater than 3, a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp and t multiplied by 2 and taken modulo MOD, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD plus t multiplied by 2 and taken modulo MOD plus t multiplied by 2 and taken modulo MOD plus t multiplied by 2 and taken modulo MOD, i is 2, x is the last element in the list a.**

The code modifies the values of `t` and `ans`. The first line doubles the value of `t`, and the second line takes the result modulo `MOD`. The third line adds the new value of `t` to `ans`, and the fourth line takes the result modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.
