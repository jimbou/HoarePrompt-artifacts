To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(k - 1):`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is at least 2.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `k` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `k` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 3, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is twice the maximum subarray sum of a modulo MOD, tmp is 0, _ is 0, ans is ((s + 2 * t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is 1**
