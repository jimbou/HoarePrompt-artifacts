The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `k-1`, so for the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1 and `k` must be at least 2.
State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 2, a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp + x and the first integer in the list a and also the maximum of tmp and the previous value of t, _ is 1, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is at least 1, tmp is either 0 if tmp was originally negative, otherwise tmp is tmp + x.**
