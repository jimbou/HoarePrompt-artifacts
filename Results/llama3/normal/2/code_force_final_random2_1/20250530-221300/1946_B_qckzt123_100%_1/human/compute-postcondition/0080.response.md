Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-6 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, k is an integer and must be at least 1, a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp and t, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is n-1, x is the last element in the list a. If tmp is less than 0, then t is set to t. Otherwise, t remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases T is at least 2, the modulo value MOD is 1000000007, and there are T-6 test cases remaining in the standard input. The integer n is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, and k is at least 1. The list a contains n integers, and s is the sum of these integers. The value of t is the maximum of tmp and t, and ans is calculated as ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD. The variable i is equal to n-1, and x is the last element in the list a. The value of t remains unchanged if tmp is non-negative, otherwise, it is set to t.
