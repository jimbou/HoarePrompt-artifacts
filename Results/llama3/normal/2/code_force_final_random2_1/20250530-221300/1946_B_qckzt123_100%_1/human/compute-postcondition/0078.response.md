Output State: `T` is an integer equal to the number of test cases and must be at least 2, `MOD` is 1000000007, `stdin` contains `T-6` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and `t`, `ans` is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * t % MOD + t, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is the last element in the list `a`. If `tmp` is less than 0, then `t` is set to `t`. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that `i` is now `n-1` and `x` is the last element in the list `a`. The value of `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and `t`, and `ans` is calculated based on the final values of `s` and `t`.
