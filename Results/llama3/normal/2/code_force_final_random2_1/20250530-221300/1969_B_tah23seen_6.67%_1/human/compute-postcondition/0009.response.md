To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved accordingly.

The loop head conditions are:
1. `left <= right`
2. `right < len(s)`
3. `left < len(s)`

Given the initial states:
- `sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5.
- `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`.
- `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
- `left` is 0.
- `cost` is 0.
- `right` is 1.

We need to ensure that all conditions in the loop head are met for the loop to execute at least once.

1. `left <= right`: This condition is already met since `left` is 0 and `right` is 1.

2. `right < len(s)`: Since `right` is 1 and `s` contains all characters of `sChar`, which has a length of at least 2, this condition is also met.

3. `left < len(s)`: Given that `left` is 0 and the length of `s` (derived from `sChar`) is at least 2, this condition is also satisfied.

Given that all conditions are already met with the provided states, no adjustments are necessary for the variables in the loop head (`left`, `right`, and implicitly `s` through its length) for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1**
