Output State: **The state remains unchanged if the elements at indices right and right+1 are not '0' and '1' respectively, except that right+1 must be less than the length of s, s[right+1] must not be '0', right is increased by 1, and right is less than len(s) - 1, and s[right] must not be '0' and right is increased by 1, and right is increased by 1.**

In natural language, this means that the value of `right` is incremented by 1, but all other conditions and variables remain the same. The state only changes if the elements at indices `right` and `right+1` are not '0' and '1' respectively, and if `right+1` is less than the length of `s`. Additionally, `s[right+1]` must not be '0', and `right` is still less than `len(s) - 1`. Also, `s[right]` must not be '0' and `right` is increased by 1.
