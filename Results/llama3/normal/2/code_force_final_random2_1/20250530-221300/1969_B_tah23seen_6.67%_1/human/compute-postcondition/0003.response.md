The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `sChar`. If `sChar` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sChar` has at least 2 characters and at most 2 * 10^5 characters, `s` is a list containing the first character of `sChar`, `i` is the first character in `sChar`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `sChar` must have at least 2 characters and at most 2 * 10^5 characters, `s` is a list containing the first character of `sChar`, and `i` is the second character in `sChar`.
State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing the first character of `sChar`, `i` is the second character in `sChar`**
