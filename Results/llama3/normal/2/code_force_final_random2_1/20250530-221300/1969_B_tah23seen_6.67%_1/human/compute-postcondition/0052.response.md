Output State: **`left` is less than `len(s)`, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, `right` is one more than its previous value, `s[right - 1]` is not equal to '0'**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, making it one more than its previous value. The condition `s[right]` is not equal to '0' is no longer valid because `right` has been incremented, but we know that `s[right - 1]` is not equal to '0' because it was the previous value of `right`. The other conditions, `left` is less than `len(s)` and `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, are still valid.
