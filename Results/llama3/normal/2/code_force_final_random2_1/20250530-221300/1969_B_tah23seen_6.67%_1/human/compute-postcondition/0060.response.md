Output State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than `len(s)` and is equal to the index of the first '1' in `s` or `len(s)` if no '1' exists, `s[right-1]` is not '0', and all characters in `s` from the initial `left` to the final `left` are not '1'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `right` remains at the end of the string `s`, `left` moves to the position of the first '1' in `s` (or reaches the end of `s` if no '1' is found), the last character of `s` is not '0', and all characters in `s` from the initial position of `left` to its final position are not '1'.
