Output State: **sChar is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, s is a list containing all characters of sChar, i is the last character in sChar, left is 0, cost is 0, right is 1**

The code initializes three new variables: `left`, `cost`, and `right`. The first line assigns the value 0 to `left`. The second line assigns the value 0 to `cost`. The third line assigns the value 1 to `right`. These assignments do not affect the values of `sChar`, `s`, or `i`, which remain unchanged. The final state includes the initial values of `sChar`, `s`, and `i`, along with the newly assigned values of `left`, `cost`, and `right`.
