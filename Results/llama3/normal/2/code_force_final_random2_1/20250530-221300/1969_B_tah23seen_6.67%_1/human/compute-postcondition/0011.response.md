Output State: **sChar is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, s is a list containing all characters of sChar, i is the last character in sChar, left is 0, cost is 2, right is 1. The current value of s[right] is '1' and the current value of s[left] is '0'.**

The first line swaps the values of `s[right]` and `s[left]`. Since `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', after the swap, `s[right]` becomes '1' and `s[left]` becomes '0'. The second line increments `cost` by the value of `right - left + 1`, which is 2. No other variables are affected.
