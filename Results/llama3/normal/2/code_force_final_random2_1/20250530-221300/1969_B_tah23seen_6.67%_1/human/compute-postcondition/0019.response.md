Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, `s[right]` is not '0' and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `left`, `cost`, `right`, `s[right]`, `s[left]` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the string `sChar` remains unchanged, consisting of only 0s and/or 1s with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5. The list `s` still contains all characters of `sChar`, and `i` remains the last character in `sChar`. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, `right` is less than or equal to the length of `s`, `s[right]` is not '0', and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, the values of `left`, `cost`, `right`, `s[right]`, and `s[left]` remain unchanged.
