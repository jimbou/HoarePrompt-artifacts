To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `left` and `s[left]`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not '1'. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, and `s[left-1]` is '0'. However, this does not guarantee that the loop will execute again, as `left` could be equal to `len(s)` or `s[left]` could be '1'.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `left` to be strictly less than `len(s)`, and the state of `s[left]` to be not '1'. Since `s[left-1]` is '0', we can infer that `s[left]` is either '0' or '1'. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `s[left]` to be '0'.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `left` is strictly less than `len(s)`, `s[left-1]` is '0', `s[left]` is '0', `cost` is 2, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`**
