Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `sChar` as input and returns the minimum cost.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first converts the input string `sChar` into a list `s` of characters. This is done to enable swapping of characters in the string.

2. It initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the first and second characters of the string, respectively. The `cost` variable is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total cost.

3. The program then enters a while loop that continues until `right` reaches the end of the string or `left` is no longer less than `right`.

4. Inside the loop, it checks if the character at the `right` index is '0' and the character at the `left` index is '1'. If this condition is true, it swaps the characters at the `right` and `left` indices and increments the `cost` by the length of the substring from `left` to `right` (inclusive).

5. After swapping, it moves the `right` pointer to the right until it finds a '0' character or reaches the end of the string.

6. It then moves the `left` pointer to the right until it finds a '1' character or reaches the end of the string.

7. The loop continues until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the string or `left` is no longer less than `right`.

8. Finally, the program returns the total `cost` as the minimum cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. It correctly handles the swapping of characters, updates the cost, and moves the pointers to find the next '0' and '1' characters. The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.
