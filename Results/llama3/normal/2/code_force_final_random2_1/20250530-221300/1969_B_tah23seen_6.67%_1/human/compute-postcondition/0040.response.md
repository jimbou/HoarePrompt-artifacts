Output State: **`right` is increased by 1 multiple times until `right` is no longer less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` is `'0'`, `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not `'1'`, and `left` is increased by 1, and `left` is still less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not `'1'`, and `left` is increased by 1 again.**

In natural language, the output state means that the value of `left` has been incremented by 1 again, while the conditions for `right` and the previous conditions for `left` remain the same. The value of `left` is now one more than its previous value, and it is still less than the length of the string `s` and the character at the new `left` index is not `'1'`.
