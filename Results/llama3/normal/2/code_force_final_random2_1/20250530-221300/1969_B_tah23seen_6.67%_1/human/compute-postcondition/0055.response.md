The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The value of `right` remains unchanged and is still equal to `len(s)`. The value of `s[right-1]` is still not '0', and the value of `s[left]` is still not '1'. However, since `left` has been incremented, the value of `s[left]` is now `s[left+1]` from the previous state, and `s[left-1]` is now `s[left]` from the previous state. Therefore, the Output State is: `right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than `len(s)` and is one more than its previous value, `s[right-1]` is not '0', and `s[left-1]` must not be '1' and `s[left]` must not be '1'.
Output State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than `len(s)` and is one more than its previous value, `s[right-1]` is not '0', and `s[left-1]` must not be '1' and `s[left]` must not be '1'**
