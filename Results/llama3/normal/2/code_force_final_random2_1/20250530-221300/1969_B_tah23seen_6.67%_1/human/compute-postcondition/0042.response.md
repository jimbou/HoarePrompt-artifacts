Output State: **`right` is increased by 1 multiple times until `right` is no longer less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` is `'0'`, `left` is less than `len(s)` and is increased by 1, and `s[left]` is not `'1'` before the increment, but after the increment `s[left]` may or may not be `'1'`**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been increased by 1. The condition that `s[left]` is not `'1'` is only guaranteed to be true before the increment, but after the increment, `s[left]` may or may not be `'1'`. The other conditions, including the value of `right` and the length of string `s`, remain the same as in the initial state.
