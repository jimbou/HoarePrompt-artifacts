To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved accordingly. The loop head is:

```
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
```

The variables involved in the loop head are `left` and `s[left]`. 

1. For `left < len(s)`, since `len(s)` is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, we don't need to adjust `len(s)` because it already satisfies the condition that `left` can be less than `len(s)`. However, we need to ensure `left` is less than `len(s)`. Given that `left` is 0 when `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', and `left` remains unchanged otherwise, we need to adjust `left` to be less than `len(s)` in all cases.

2. For `s[left] != '1'`, since `sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, we need to ensure that `s[left]` is not '1' when the loop starts. Given that `s[left]` is '0' when `s[right]` is not '0' and `s[left]` remains '0' otherwise, we need to adjust `s[left]` to be '0' in all cases.

State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `left` is less than `len(s)`, `s[left]` is '0', `cost` is 2, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`**
