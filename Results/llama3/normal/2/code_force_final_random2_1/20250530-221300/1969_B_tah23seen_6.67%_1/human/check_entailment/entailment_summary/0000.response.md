Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `sChar` as input and returns the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's in the string.

The function works by iterating through the list representation of the string, swapping '1's and '0's as necessary, and keeping track of the number of swaps performed. The function returns the total number of swaps required to achieve the desired arrangement.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1.  The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the cyclic shift operation. It simply swaps '1's and '0's in the string, which is not the same as performing a cyclic shift.
2.  The function does not correctly calculate the cost of the operations. The cost of a cyclic shift operation is the length of the substring being shifted, but the function simply increments the cost by 1 for each swap.
3.  The function does not handle the case where the input string is already sorted.

Despite these issues, the program does produce the correct output for the given example inputs. However, this is likely due to the specific nature of the inputs rather than the correctness of the program.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
