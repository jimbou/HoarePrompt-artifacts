Output State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than `len(s)` and is three more than its previous value, `s[right-1]` is not '0', and `s[left-1]` must not be '1' and `s[left]` must not be '1' and `s[left+1]` must not be '1` and `s[left+2]` must not be '1**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `right` and the conditions on the characters of `s` remain unchanged. The new value of `left` is three more than its previous value, and it is still less than `len(s)`. The conditions on the characters of `s` at indices `left-1`, `left`, `left+1`, and `left+2` are still valid, and `s[right-1]` is still not '0'.
