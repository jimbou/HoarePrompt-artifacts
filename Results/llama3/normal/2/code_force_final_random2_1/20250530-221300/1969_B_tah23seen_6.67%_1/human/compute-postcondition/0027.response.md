To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement and adjust the states accordingly. The loop statement is:

```
while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
```

From the given state, we know:

- `sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5.
- `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`.
- `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
- `left` is equal to `len(s)`.
- `cost` is 2.
- `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`.
- `s[left-1]` is '0' if `left` is not equal to 0.
- `s[left]` is '1' if `left` is not equal to 0.

However, to adjust the state so that the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `left`, `right`, and `s` (since `len(s)` is involved).

1. **Condition `left <= right`**: For the loop to execute again, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. Given that `left` is currently equal to `len(s)`, and `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, this condition cannot be guaranteed to hold true for another iteration without adjustment. However, since we cannot decrease `left` (as it's defined by `len(s)`), we must ensure `right` is at least equal to `left` for the condition to potentially hold. But given `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, and `left` equals `len(s)`, this condition actually suggests that `right` should be equal to `left` (`len(s)`) for the loop to have a chance to execute again under this condition alone.

2. **Condition `right < len(s)`**: This condition is already violated since `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)` and `left` equals `len(s)`, indicating that `right` cannot be less than `len(s)` if `left` is `len(s)`. For the loop to execute again, `right` must be less than `len(s)`, but given `left` equals `len(s)`, this condition cannot be satisfied without adjusting `left` or `right` in a way that contradicts their current definitions.

3. **Condition `(left < len(s))`**: Given `left` is equal to `len(s)`, this condition is not met. For the loop to execute again, `left` must be less than `len(s)`.

Considering these conditions, the only way to ensure the loop can execute one more time is to adjust `left` to be less than `len(s)`, as this adjustment does not contradict any given state and allows for the possibility of satisfying the other conditions depending on the exact values of `right` and the length of `s`.

However, since we are strictly following the format and the task does not allow for assumptions beyond the provided state, we must recognize that the loop conditions as they stand (`left` being equal to `len(s)`) do not allow for another iteration without contradicting the given state. Thus, the state cannot be adjusted in a way that guarantees another iteration without altering the fundamental relationship between `left` and `len(s)` or assuming information not provided.

Given the strict instructions and the format to follow, the correct response under these constraints is to acknowledge that the loop cannot execute again under the given conditions without violating the provided state. However, since the task format requires a specific response structure and the question seems to imply a need for adjustment, it appears there might be a misunderstanding in the task's requirements based on the provided examples and the strict format.

To adhere to the format while acknowledging the analysis:

State: **No adjustment can be made to guarantee another iteration without violating the given state or assuming additional information.**
