Output State: **`left` is less than `len(s)`, `right` is greater than or equal to `left` and less than or equal to `len(s)`, `right` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `left` and `len(s)` remain unchanged. The relationship between `left` and `right` is still maintained, with `right` being greater than or equal to `left`. Additionally, `right` is still less than or equal to `len(s)`, but its new value is one more than its previous value.
