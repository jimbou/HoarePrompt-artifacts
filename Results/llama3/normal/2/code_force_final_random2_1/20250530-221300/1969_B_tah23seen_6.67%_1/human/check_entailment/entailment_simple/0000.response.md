Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program uses a greedy approach to achieve this.

The function `func_1(s)` takes a binary string `s` as input and returns the minimum cost required to sort it. The function iterates through the string from left to right, swapping '1's and '0's whenever it encounters a '1' followed by a '0'. The cost of each swap is calculated as the length of the substring being swapped.

The program maintains two pointers, `left` and `right`, to track the positions of the next '1' and '0' to be swapped. The `left` pointer is incremented until it points to a '1', and the `right` pointer is incremented until it points to a '0'. When a '1' is found followed by a '0', the characters are swapped, and the cost is incremented by the length of the substring being swapped.

The program continues this process until the `left` pointer reaches the end of the string or there are no more '1's to swap.

The key insight behind this approach is that swapping a '1' with a '0' will always reduce the number of '1's on the right side of the string, which in turn reduces the number of swaps required to sort the string. By greedily swapping '1's and '0's whenever possible, the program ensures that the minimum number of swaps is performed.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct, and it will produce the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

Correctness: **True**
