    #The program returns the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's in sChar.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string `sChar` consisting of only 0s and 1s as input, and returns the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's in the string. The function does not modify the original string, but rather works with a list representation of the string. It iterates through the list, swapping '1's and '0's as necessary, and keeps track of the number of swaps performed. The function returns the total number of swaps required to achieve the desired arrangement.
