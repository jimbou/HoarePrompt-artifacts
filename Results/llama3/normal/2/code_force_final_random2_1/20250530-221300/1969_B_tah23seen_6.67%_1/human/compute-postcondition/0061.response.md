Output State: **left is equal to len(s), right is equal to len(s), cost is the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's in sChar, s is a list containing all characters of sChar, and all characters in s from the initial left to the final left are not '1'.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the left and right pointers have reached the end of the string, the cost is the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's in the string, and all characters in the string from the initial left pointer to the final left pointer are not '1'. This means that the loop has successfully rearranged the string to have all '1's on the left and all '0's on the right, and the cost is the minimum number of swaps required to achieve this.
