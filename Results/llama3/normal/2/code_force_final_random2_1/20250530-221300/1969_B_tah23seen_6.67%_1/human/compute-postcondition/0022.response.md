To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `left` and `s[left]` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not '1'. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, and `s[left-1]` is '0'. To guarantee the loop can execute again, `left` must be less than `len(s)`, and `s[left]` must be '0'.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `left` is less than `len(s)`, `s[left]` is '0', `cost` is 2, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`**
