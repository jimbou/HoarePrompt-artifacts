To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `right` and `s[right]`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `right` is less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` is not '0'.

At the end of the last iteration, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, and `s[right]` is not '0'. However, `right` being less than or equal to `len(s)` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `right` is less than `len(s)`. Additionally, `s[right]` being not '0' is already satisfied, so no adjustment is needed for `s[right]`.

State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, `right` is less than `len(s)`, `s[right]` is not '0' and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `left`, `cost`, `right`, `s[right]`, `s[left]` remain unchanged.**
