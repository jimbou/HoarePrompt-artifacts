To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `right < len(s) and s[right] != '0'`.

1. **`right < len(s)`**: This condition is already satisfied because `right` is 1 and `len(s)` is at least 2 (since the length of `sChar` is at least 2).

2. **`s[right] != '0'`**: This condition is also already satisfied because `s[right]` is '1'.

Since both conditions are already met with the given state, no adjustments are needed to the states of `right`, `len(s)`, or `s[right]` for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:

State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, `right` is 1, `s[right]` is '1' and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `left`, `cost`, `right`, `s[right]`, `s[left]` remain unchanged.**
