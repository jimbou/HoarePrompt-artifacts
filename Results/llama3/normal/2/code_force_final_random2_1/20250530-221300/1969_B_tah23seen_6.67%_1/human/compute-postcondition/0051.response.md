The variables in the loop head are `right` and `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `right` and `s`. If `right` is less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` is not equal to '0', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is greater than or equal to `left` and less than or equal to `len(s)`, and `right` is increased by 1. `right` being greater than or equal to `left` and less than or equal to `len(s)` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `right` is less than `len(s)`. Also, `s[right]` must not be equal to '0' for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`left` is less than `len(s)`, `right` is less than `len(s)`, `s[right]` is not equal to '0'**
