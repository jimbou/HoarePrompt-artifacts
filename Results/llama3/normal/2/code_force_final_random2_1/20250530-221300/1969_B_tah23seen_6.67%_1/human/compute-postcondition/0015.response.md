The variables in the loop head are `right` and `s[right]`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `right` and `s[right]`. If `right` is less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` is not '0', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is 2 and `s[right]` is '0'. `right` being 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `right` is less than `len(s)`. Also, `s[right]` being '0' does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `s[right]` is not '0'. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, `right` is less than `len(s)`, `s[right]` is not '0' and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `left`, `cost`, `right`, `s[right]`, `s[left]` remain unchanged.**
