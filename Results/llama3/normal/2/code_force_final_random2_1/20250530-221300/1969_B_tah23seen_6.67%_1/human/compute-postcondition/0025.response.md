Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `left` is strictly less than `len(s)`, `s[left-1]` is '0', `s[left]` is '0', `cost` is 2, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, and `left` has been incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been increased by 1, but the values of the other variables remain the same. The string `sChar` and the list `s` are unchanged, and the last character in `sChar` is still stored in `i`. The conditions on the values of `s[left-1]`, `s[left]`, `cost`, and `right` are also still valid.
