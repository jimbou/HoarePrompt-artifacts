To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `left` and `s[left]`.

According to the code, the loop can execute if `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not equal to '1'.

Right before the loop, `left` is less than `len(s)`, which is already a condition that allows the loop to execute. However, `s[right-1]` is not '0', which does not provide any information about `s[left]`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `s[left]` to ensure it is not equal to '1'.

State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not '0', and `s[left]` must not be '1'**
