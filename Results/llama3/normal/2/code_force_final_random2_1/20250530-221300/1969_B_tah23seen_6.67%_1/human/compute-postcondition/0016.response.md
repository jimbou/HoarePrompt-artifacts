Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, `s[right]` is not '0' and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `left`, `cost`, `right`, `s[right]`, `s[left]` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, which means it has moved one position to the right in the string `sChar`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the code execution are still true. The only change is that `right` is now one position ahead, which may affect the conditions that depend on `s[right]` and `s[left]`.
