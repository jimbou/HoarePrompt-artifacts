Output State: **`left` is less than `len(s)`, `right` is greater than or equal to `left` and less than or equal to `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not '0'**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, so it is now greater than or equal to `left` and less than or equal to `len(s)`. The value of `left` remains unchanged, and the condition `s[right-1]` is not '0' is still valid because `right-1` is the previous value of `right` before the increment.
