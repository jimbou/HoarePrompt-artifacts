Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing the first three characters of `sChar`, `i` is the third character in `sChar`.**

In this output state, the length of `sChar` remains the same, and its contents are still only 0-s and/or 1-s. The list `s` now contains the first three characters of `sChar`, as the third character `i` has been appended to it. The value of `i` remains the same, which is the third character in `sChar`.
