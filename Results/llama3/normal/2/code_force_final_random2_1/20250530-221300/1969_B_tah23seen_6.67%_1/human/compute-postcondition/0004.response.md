Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing the first two characters of `sChar`, `i` is the second character in `sChar`.**

In this output state, the length of `sChar` remains the same, and it still consists of only 0-s and/or 1-s. The list `s` now contains the first two characters of `sChar`, which were initially the first character and the second character `i`. The value of `i` remains the same, which is the second character in `sChar`.
