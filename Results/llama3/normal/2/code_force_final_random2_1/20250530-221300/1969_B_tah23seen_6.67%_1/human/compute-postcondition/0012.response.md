Postcondition: ***`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, `right` is 1, `s[right]` is '1' and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `left`, `cost`, `right`, `s[right]`, `s[left]` remain unchanged.***
