Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, `s[left-1]` is '0', `cost` is 2, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to `len(s)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
