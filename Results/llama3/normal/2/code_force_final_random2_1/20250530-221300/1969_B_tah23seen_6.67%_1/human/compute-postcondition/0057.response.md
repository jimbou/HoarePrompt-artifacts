Output State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than `len(s)` and is two more than its previous value, `s[right-1]` is not '0', and `s[left-1]` must not be '1' and `s[left]` must not be '1' and `s[left+1]` must not be '1'**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been incremented by 1, making it two more than its previous value. The other conditions and variable values remain the same as in the initial state.
