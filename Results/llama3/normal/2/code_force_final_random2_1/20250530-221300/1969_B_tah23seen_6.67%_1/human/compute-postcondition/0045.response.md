Output State: **left is less than len(s), right is greater than or equal to left and less than len(s), s has been modified such that the characters at indices left and right have been swapped, cost has been incremented by the value of right - left + 1.**

In this final state, the values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The string `s` has been modified, with the characters at indices `left` and `right` swapped. The value of `cost` has been incremented by the value of `right - left + 1`, which is the number of characters between `left` and `right` (inclusive).
