Output State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not '0'.**

The loop will continue to execute as long as `right` is less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` is not '0'. After the loop finishes executing, `right` will be equal to `len(s)`, and `left` will still be less than `len(s)`. Additionally, since the loop only increments `right` when `s[right]` is not '0', the character at index `right-1` will not be '0'.
