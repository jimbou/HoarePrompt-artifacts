Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `left` is equal to `len(s)`, `cost` is 2, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, `s[left-1]` is '0' if `left` is not equal to 0, `s[left]` is '1' if `left` is not equal to 0.**

The loop will continue to execute until `left` is no longer less than `len(s)` or `s[left]` is '1'. Since `sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, the loop will eventually terminate when `left` reaches the end of the string or encounters a '1'. At this point, `left` will be equal to `len(s)`, and `s[left-1]` will be '0' if `left` is not equal to 0. If `left` is not equal to 0, then `s[left]` will be '1'. The values of `cost` and `right` remain unchanged throughout the loop, so they will still be 2 and less than or equal to `len(s)`, respectively.
