Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be that `sChar` remains unchanged as a string of 0s and 1s with a length between 2 and 200,000. The list `s` will contain all characters from `sChar`, effectively becoming a copy of `sChar` but in list form. The variable `i` will hold the value of the last character in `sChar`.
