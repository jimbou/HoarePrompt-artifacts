Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The state remains unchanged if the elements at indices right and right+1 are not '0' and '1' respectively, except that right+1 must be less than the length of s, s[right+1] must not be '0', right is increased by 1, and right is less than len(s) - 1, and s[right] must not be '0' and right is increased by 1, and right is increased by 1, and right is increased by 1, and so on, until right is no longer less than len(s) and s[right] is '0'.
Code of the loop:
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    left += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The state remains unchanged if the elements at indices right and right+1 are not '0' and '1' respectively, except that right+1 must be less than the length of s, s[right+1] must not be '0', right is increased by 1, and right is less than len(s) - 1, and s[right] must not be '0' and right is increased by 1, and right is increased by 1, and right is increased by 1, and so on, until right is no longer less than len(s) and s[right] is '0', and left is less than len(s) and s[left] is not '1', and left is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `right` is increased by 1 multiple times until `right` is no longer less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` is `'0'`, `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not `'1'`, and `left` is increased by 1, and `left` is still less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not `'1'`, and `left` is increased by 1 again.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `right` is increased by 1 multiple times until `right` is no longer less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` is `'0'`, `left` is less than `len(s)` and is increased by 1, and `s[left]` is not `'1'` before the increment, but after the increment `s[left]` may or may not be `'1'`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
