Output State: **The state remains unchanged if the elements at indices right and right+1 are not '0' and '1' respectively, except that right+1 must be less than the length of s and s[right+1] must not be '0', and right is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, and the conditions for the state to remain unchanged have been updated accordingly. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
