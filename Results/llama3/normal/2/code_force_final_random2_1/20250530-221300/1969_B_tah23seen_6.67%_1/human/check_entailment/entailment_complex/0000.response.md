Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `sChar` as input and returns the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's in the string.

The program first converts the input string `sChar` into a list `s` of characters. It then initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the first and second characters of the list, respectively. The `cost` variable is initialized to 0 to keep track of the minimum number of swaps required.

The program then enters a while loop that continues until `left` is greater than `right` or `right` reaches the end of the list. Inside the loop, the program checks if the character at the `right` index is '0' and the character at the `left` index is '1'. If this condition is true, the program swaps the characters at the `right` and `left` indices and increments the `cost` by the difference between `right` and `left` plus 1.

After the swap, the program increments the `right` pointer until it finds a '0' character or reaches the end of the list. It also increments the `left` pointer until it finds a '1' character or reaches the end of the list.

Once the while loop exits, the program returns the `cost` variable, which represents the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's in the input string.

Based on the provided execution states and the problem description, the given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the binary string in non-descending order.

Correctness: **True**
