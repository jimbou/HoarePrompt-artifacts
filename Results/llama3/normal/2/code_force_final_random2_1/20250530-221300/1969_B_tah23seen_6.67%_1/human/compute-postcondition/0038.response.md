Output State: **The state remains unchanged if the elements at indices right and right+1 are not '0' and '1' respectively, except that right+1 must be less than the length of s, s[right+1] must not be '0', right is increased by 1, and right is less than len(s) - 1, and s[right] must not be '0' and right is increased by 1, and right is increased by 1, and right is increased by 1, and so on, until right is no longer less than len(s) and s[right] is '0', and left is less than len(s) and s[left] is not '1', and left is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `left` is increased by 1, while all other conditions and variables remain the same as in the initial state.
