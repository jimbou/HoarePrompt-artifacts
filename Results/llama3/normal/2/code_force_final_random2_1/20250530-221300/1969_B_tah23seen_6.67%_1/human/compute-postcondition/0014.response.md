Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, `right` is 2, `s[right]` is `s[2]` and `s[left]` is '0'. Otherwise, `left`, `cost`, `right`, `s[right]`, `s[left]` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `sChar` and the list `s` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is still the last character in `sChar`. The value of `right` has been incremented by 1. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `left` is 0, `cost` is 2, `right` is now 2, and `s[right]` is the character at index 2 in `s`, and `s[left]` is '0'. If this condition is not met, the values of `left`, `cost`, `right`, `s[right]`, and `s[left]` remain the same.
