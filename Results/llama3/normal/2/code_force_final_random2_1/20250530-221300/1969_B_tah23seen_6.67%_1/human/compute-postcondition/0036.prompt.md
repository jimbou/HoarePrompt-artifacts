Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *The state remains unchanged if the elements at indices right and left are not '0' and '1' respectively. If the elements at indices right and left are '0' and '1' respectively, the elements at these indices are swapped and the cost is increased by the difference between right and left plus 1.
Code of the loop:
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The state remains unchanged if the elements at indices right and right+1 are not '0' and '1' respectively, except that right+1 must be less than the length of s and s[right+1] must not be '0', and right is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The state remains unchanged if the elements at indices right and right+1 are not '0' and '1' respectively, except that right+1 must be less than the length of s, s[right+1] must not be '0', right is increased by 1, and right is less than len(s) - 1, and s[right] must not be '0'.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The state remains unchanged if the elements at indices right and right+1 are not '0' and '1' respectively, except that right+1 must be less than the length of s, s[right+1] must not be '0', right is increased by 1, and right is less than len(s) - 1, and s[right] must not be '0' and right is increased by 1, and right is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
