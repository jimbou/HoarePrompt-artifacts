Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` is equal to the number of occurrences of `char` in `a`, `char` is the last character in the string, `needed_problems` is `m - count[i]`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `count[i]` is less than `m`.**

In this output state, the value of `needed_problems` has been updated to be the difference between `m` and the current value of `count[i]`, which is less than `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
