Output State: **The program returns the sum of `m - count[j]` for all `j` such that `count[j]` is less than `m`, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, and `count` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` is equal to the number of occurrences of `char` in string `a`, and `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', and `n` is an integer between 1 and 50.**
