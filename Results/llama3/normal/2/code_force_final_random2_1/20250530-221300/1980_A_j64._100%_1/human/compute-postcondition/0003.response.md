To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `char` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more characters in the string `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 character, and `char` is the first character in the string.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 2 characters, and `char` must be the second character in the string.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 2 characters, `count` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` is 1 and the rest are 0, `char` is the second character in the string.**
