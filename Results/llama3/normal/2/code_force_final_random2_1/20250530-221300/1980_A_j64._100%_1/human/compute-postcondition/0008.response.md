Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` is equal to the number of occurrences of `char` in `a`, `char` is the last character in the string, `needed_problems` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `count`, and `char` remain the same as in the initial state, since the code does not modify them. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `needed_problems`, which is initialized to 0.
