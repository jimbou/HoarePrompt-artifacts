Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 1 character, `count` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` is 1 and the rest are 0, `char` is the first character in the string.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been updated. The index of `count` that corresponds to the ASCII value of the first character in the string `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A' has been incremented by 1. This means that the count for the first character in the string has been incremented. The values of the other variables remain the same.
