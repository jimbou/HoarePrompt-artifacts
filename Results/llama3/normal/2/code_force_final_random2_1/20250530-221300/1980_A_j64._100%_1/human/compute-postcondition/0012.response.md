Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at index `ord(char) - ord('A')` is equal to the number of occurrences of `char` in `a`, `char` is the last character in the string, `i` is 0. If the current value of `count[i]` is less than `m`, then `needed_problems` is set to `m - count[i]`. Otherwise, `needed_problems` remains 0.***
