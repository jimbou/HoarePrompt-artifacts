Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is an integer, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is set to 1. In both cases, `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or `i`, and `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1. Additionally, `stdin` remains empty.***
