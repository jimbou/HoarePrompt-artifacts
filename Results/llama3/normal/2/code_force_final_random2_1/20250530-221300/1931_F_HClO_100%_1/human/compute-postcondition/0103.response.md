Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1`, `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of (a3, l3), `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `m` must be greater than 1, (a3, l3) is the first tuple in the list `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
