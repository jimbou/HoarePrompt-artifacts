Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples of `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the first list from the third tuple in `val`, 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted by the break statement.
