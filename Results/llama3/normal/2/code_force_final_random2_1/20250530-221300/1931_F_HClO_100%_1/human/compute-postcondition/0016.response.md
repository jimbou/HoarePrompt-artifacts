Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer and is at least 4, `stdin` is empty, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22**

The code `input()` accepts a string from the input and does not assign it to any variable. The stdin contains one input: a string, which is consumed by the `input()` function. As a result, the stdin becomes empty. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
