Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is either 1 or m - 2, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, i is n - 1, val is an empty list, stdin is empty, m - 1 inputs have been read and discarded. If idx1 is not -1 and idx2 is -1, then idx2 is set to n - 2. If idx1 is n - 1 and idx2 is n - 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is n - 1 and idx2 is n - 2. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2], the values of idx1, idx2, p1, and p2 remain unchanged. Additionally, idx1 is not less than idx2. idx1 is less than or equal to idx2. If m is 2, then 'yes' is printed, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. a3 is an integer and is the first integer from the third input, l3 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the third input. The current value of l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2). l1 now contains a1 at the idx2 position, and l is a reference to the updated l1.**
