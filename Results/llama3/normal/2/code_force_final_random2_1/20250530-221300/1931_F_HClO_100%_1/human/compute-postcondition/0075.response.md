Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is an integer, n is an integer and must be at least 3, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, i is an integer and is n - 1, p1 is an integer and is either 0 or 1, p2 is an integer and is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, idx1 is not less than idx2, and l is a list of integers equal to l1.**

In this output state, the value of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain unchanged. The list `l1` has been modified by inserting the value of `a1` at index `idx2`. The variable `l` has been assigned the value of `l1`, which now includes the inserted value of `a1`. The relationship between `idx1` and `idx2` remains the same, with `idx1` not being less than `idx2`.
