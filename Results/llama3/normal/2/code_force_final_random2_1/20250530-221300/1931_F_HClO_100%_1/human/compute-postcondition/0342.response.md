Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k, followed by k lines of n distinct integers. It then checks if the integers in the k lines can be rearranged to form a single sequence of distinct integers from 1 to n. If possible, it prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'no'. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.**
