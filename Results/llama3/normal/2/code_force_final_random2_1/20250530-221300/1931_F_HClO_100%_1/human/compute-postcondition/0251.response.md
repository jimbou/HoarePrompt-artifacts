Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is either 1 or `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `m - 1` inputs have been read and discarded. The current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is affected by the break statement.
