Output State: **`_` is 0, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples of (`a3`, `l3`), `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list `val`, stdin is empty, m - 2 inputs have been read and discarded, 'no' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `_`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged, and the stdin remains empty. The fact that m - 2 inputs have been read and discarded, and 'no' is printed, is still valid.
