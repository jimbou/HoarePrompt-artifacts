Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is m - 1, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input with a1 inserted at index idx2, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, idx1 is either n - 2 or n - 1 or i, idx2 is either n - 2 or n - 1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, n is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, i is n - 1, stdin is empty, m - 2 inputs have been read and discarded, l is a list of integers and is equal to l1.**

The code inserts `a1` at index `idx2` in `l1` and assigns `l1` to `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
