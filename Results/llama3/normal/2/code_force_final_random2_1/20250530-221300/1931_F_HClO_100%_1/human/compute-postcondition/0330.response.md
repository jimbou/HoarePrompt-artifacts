The only objects in the loop head are variables  `a3`, `l3` and list  `val`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `val`.  If the list has at least 2 tuples the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `val` has at least 1 tuple, `a3` is the first integer from the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the first list from the first tuple in `val`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 tuples and the `a3` is the first integer from the second tuple in `val` and `l3` is the first list from the second tuple in `val`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the first list from the second tuple in `val`.**
