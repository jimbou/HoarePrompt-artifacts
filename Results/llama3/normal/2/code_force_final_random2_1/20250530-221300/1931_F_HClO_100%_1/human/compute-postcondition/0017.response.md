Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `stdin` is empty, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is now equal to `m - 2`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged as integers, lists of integers, and lists of integers respectively, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `stdin` is empty, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22`.
