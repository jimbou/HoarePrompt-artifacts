Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is m - 1, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 1 or 0, p2 is either 1 or 0, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list val, l3 is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list val, n must be at least 2, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, i is 0, stdin is empty, m - 2 inputs have been read and discarded. If i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Either l1[i + p1] is equal to a2 and idx1 is i, p1 is 1, p2 is 0 or l1[i + p1] is not equal to a2 and idx2 is i, p1 is 0, p2 is 1. Either l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2] or l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1. The current values of idx1 and idx2 are both greater than or equal to 0.**
