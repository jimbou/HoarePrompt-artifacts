To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for (a3, l3) in val:`, which means we are iterating over the tuples in the `val` list.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `val` contains at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`. For the loop to execute again, there must be another tuple in `val` that we haven't processed yet.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the tuple `(a3, l3)` that we are iterating over. We need to move to the next tuple in the `val` list.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is m - 2, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either n - 2 or n - 1 or i, `idx2` is either n - 2 or n - 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples (a3, l3) and (a4, l4), `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, `i` is n - 1, `stdin` is empty, `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded, `a4` is an integer and is the first integer from the fourth input, `l4` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the fourth input. If the current value of `l4` is not equal to the list of integers from `l` excluding `a4`, then 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

Note that I've updated the state of `val` to contain at least two tuples, and introduced new variables `a4` and `l4` to represent the next tuple in the `val` list.
