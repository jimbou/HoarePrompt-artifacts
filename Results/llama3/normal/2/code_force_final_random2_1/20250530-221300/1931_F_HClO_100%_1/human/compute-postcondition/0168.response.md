Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is m - 1, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, idx1 is 2, idx2 is 2, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list val, l3 is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list val, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, i is 2, stdin is empty, m - 2 inputs have been read and discarded.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`, making them both equal to 2. Since `i` is 2, this change affects the values of `idx1` and `idx2`. The `break` statement exits the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of any variables. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet.
