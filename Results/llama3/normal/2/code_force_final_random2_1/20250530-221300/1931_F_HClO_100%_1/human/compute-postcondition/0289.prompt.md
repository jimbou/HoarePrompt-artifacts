Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is either 1 or m - 2, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, val is an empty list, n is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, i is n - 1, stdin is empty, m - 1 inputs have been read and discarded.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is either 1 or `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `m - 1` inputs have been read and discarded. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is either 1 or m - 2, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, i is 1, stdin is empty, m - 1 inputs have been read and discarded. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2], then if l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is 1, idx2 is 1, p1 is 1, p2 is 1. Otherwise, if both idx1 and idx2 are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of idx1, idx2, p1, and p2 remain unchanged. If i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is either 1 or m - 2, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, i is 2, stdin is empty, m - 1 inputs have been read and discarded. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is 2 and idx2 is 2. If idx1 and idx2 are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2], the values of idx1, idx2, p1, and p2 remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
