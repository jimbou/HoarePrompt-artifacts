Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is an integer, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1`, `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, If `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is updated to `n - 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made. stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `idx1`, `idx2` remain the same as in the initial state. `a3` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `l3` is assigned the rest of the integers from the input. The stdin is now empty.
