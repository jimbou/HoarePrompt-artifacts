Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is either 1 or m - 2, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, i is 2, idx1 is 2, idx2 is 2, stdin is empty, m - 1 inputs have been read and discarded.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`, effectively setting both `idx1` and `idx2` to 2. No other variables are affected by the code. The values of `t`, `_`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` and the number of discarded inputs also remain the same.
