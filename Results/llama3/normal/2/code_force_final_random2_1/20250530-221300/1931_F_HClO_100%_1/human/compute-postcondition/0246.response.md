The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since we are already inside a loop, the `continue` statement will cause the loop to move on to the next iteration.

Output State: **`_` is `m - 2`, `stdin` is empty, `m - 1` inputs have been read and discarded, and `m - 2` more inputs have been read and discarded, and 'no' is printed, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
