Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 1`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 1` or `i`, `idx2` is either `n - 1` or `i`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples of (`a3`, `l3`), `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` is empty, `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is `n - 1` and `idx2` is `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is `n - 1` and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx2` is `n - 1` and `p2` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is either `n - 1` or `i` and `idx2` is either `n - 1` or `i`. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` have been updated based on the conditions inside the loop. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n - 1` or `i`, depending on whether the conditions inside the loop were met. The values of `p1` and `p2` are either `0` or `1`, depending on whether the conditions inside the loop were met. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
