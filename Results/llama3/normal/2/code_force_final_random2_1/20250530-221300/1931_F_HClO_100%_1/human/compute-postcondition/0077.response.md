Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is an integer, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1`, `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list. If `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is -1, then the current value of `idx2` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made. `idx1` is not less than `idx2`. `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. The current value of `m` is 2.***
