Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n and m are integers, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, stdin contains one less input than before, and the current value of l11 is not equal to l22.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    input()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer and is at least 3, `stdin` contains no input, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer and is at least 4, `stdin` contains one input: a string, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer and is at least 4, `stdin` is empty, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
