Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is an integer, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer and is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is an integer and is 1, `p1` is an integer and is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is an integer and is 1, `p2` is an integer and is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the variables are still valid. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
