Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is m - 2, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either n - 2 or n - 1 or i, `idx2` is either n - 2 or n - 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, `i` is n - 1, `stdin` is empty, `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded. If all iterations of the loop completed without breaking, then 'yes' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations means that the loop has processed all the tuples in the `val` list without finding any mismatch between the list `l` and the list obtained by excluding `a3` from `l`. If this condition is met, the program prints 'yes', indicating that all iterations of the loop completed successfully without breaking.
