The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `m`. If `_` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be at least 4.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer and is at least 4, `stdin` contains no input, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22**
