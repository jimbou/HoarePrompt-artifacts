Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly handles the edge case where m is 1 and prints 'yes' immediately. For m greater than 1, it correctly compares the first two lines of the screenshot and determines the position of the authors in the list. It then constructs the list of participants in the correct order and checks if the remaining screenshots match this order. If any screenshot does not match, it prints 'no' and breaks the loop. If all screenshots match, it prints 'yes'. The program also correctly handles the case where the authors are in the same position in the list.

Correctness: **True**
