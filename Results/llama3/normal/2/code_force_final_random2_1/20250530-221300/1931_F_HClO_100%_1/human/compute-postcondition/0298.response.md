Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is either 1 or `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is an empty list, stdin is empty, `m - 1` inputs have been read and discarded. `l2` now contains `a2` at index `idx1`, and `l` is equal to `l2`.**

The code modifies the list `l2` by inserting `a2` at the index `idx1`, and then assigns the modified `l2` to a new variable `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
