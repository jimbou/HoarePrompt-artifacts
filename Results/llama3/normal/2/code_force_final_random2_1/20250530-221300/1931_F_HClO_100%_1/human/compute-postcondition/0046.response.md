Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is an integer, n is an integer and must be at least 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, i is an integer and is 1, idx2 is an integer and is 1, p2 is an integer and is 1.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`, making `idx2` equal to 1. It also assigns the value 1 to `p2`. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state of all other variables remains the same.
