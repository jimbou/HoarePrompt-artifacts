Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is an integer, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1`, `idx1` is an integer and is either -1 or a value between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `idx2` is an integer and is either -1 or a value between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list.**

The code creates a new empty list `val` and assigns it to the variable `val`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
