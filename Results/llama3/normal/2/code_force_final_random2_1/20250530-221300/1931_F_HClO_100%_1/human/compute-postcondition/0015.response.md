To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `m - 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `m` is at least 4.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `m` remains the same, but we need to ensure that `m` is still at least 4 to satisfy the loop condition.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer and is at least 4, `stdin` contains one input: a string, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22**
