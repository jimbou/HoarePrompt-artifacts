Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers**.

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of `n` and `m` to the integers obtained from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. The stdin is now empty since it has been read.
