To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `a3`, `l3`, and `val`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of `(a3, l3)`. For the loop to execute, `val` must have at least one tuple. Since `m` is at least 3, `m - 2` is at least 1.


2. `a3` and `l3` are variables that will take the values of the tuples in `val`. For the loop to execute, `a3` and `l3` should be initialized with the first tuple in `val`.


Based on the above reasoning, the adjusted state is:


State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple of `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the first list from the first tuple in `val`, `stdin` is empty, `m - 1` inputs have been read and discarded**
