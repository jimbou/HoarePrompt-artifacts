To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `a3` and `l3`, as well as the list `val`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the tuples in the list `val`. At the end of the previous iteration, `(a3, l3)` is the first tuple in the list `val`. For the loop to execute again, the list `val` must have at least two tuples.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1`, `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of (a3, l3), `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the second tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the second tuple in the list `val`, `m` must be greater than 1**
