The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 1`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples of `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, `i` is 2, stdin is empty, `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, either `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `idx1` is `i`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0 or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
