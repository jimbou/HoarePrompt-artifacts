Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer and is at least 3, `stdin` contains no input, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22**

The code `input()` accepts an input from the user, but since the initial state already mentions that `stdin` contains one less input than before, it means that there is one input left in `stdin`. After executing the code, this input is consumed, and `stdin` becomes empty. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
