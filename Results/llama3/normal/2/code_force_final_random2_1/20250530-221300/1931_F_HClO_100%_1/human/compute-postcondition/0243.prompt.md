Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 1, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, idx1 is either n - 2 or n - 1 or i, idx2 is either n - 2 or n - 1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, n is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, i is n - 1, stdin is empty, m - 1 inputs have been read and discarded. If m is 1, then 'yes' is printed and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    input()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either `n` - 2 or `n` - 1 or `i`, `idx2` is either `n` - 2 or `n` - 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is `n` - 1, `stdin` is empty, `m` - 1 inputs have been read and discarded, and one more input has been read and discarded.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either `n` - 2 or `n` - 1 or `i`, `idx2` is either `n` - 2 or `n` - 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is `n` - 1, `stdin` is empty, `m` - 1 inputs have been read and discarded, and one more input has been read and discarded, and one more input has been read and discarded.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either `n` - 2 or `n` - 1 or `i`, `idx2` is either `n` - 2 or `n` - 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is at least 4, `i` is `n` - 1, `stdin` is empty, `m` - 1 inputs have been read and discarded, and one more input has been read and discarded, and one more input has been read and discarded, and one more input has been read and discarded.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
