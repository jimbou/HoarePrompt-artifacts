Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 1`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples of (`a3`, `l3`), `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1`.**

The code updates the values of `n` and `m` by assigning them the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `n` is no longer guaranteed to be at least 3, as its value is now determined by the input.
