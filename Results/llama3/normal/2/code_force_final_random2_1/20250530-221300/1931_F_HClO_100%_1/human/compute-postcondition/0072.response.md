Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is an integer, n is an integer and must be at least 3, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, i is an integer and is n - 1, p1 is an integer and is either 0 or 1, p2 is an integer and is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, l is a list of integers and is equal to l2, idx1 is an integer and is less than idx2, idx2 is an integer and is either -1 or n - 2.**

The code modifies the list `l2` by inserting the value of `a2` at the position `idx1`. This results in a new list `l2` with `a2` added at the specified position. The variable `l` is then assigned the value of `l2`, making `l` a reference to the modified list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
