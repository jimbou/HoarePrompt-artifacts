The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than m - 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 2, m is at least 3 and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ is 3 and m must be at least 4.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 3, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 4, i is n - 1, val is a list containing two tuples of (a3, l3), where a3 is an integer and l3 is a list of integers from the input, stdin is empty, m inputs have been read and discarded.**
