To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `m` is an integer and is at least 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `m` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 1
* `m` is an integer and is at least 3

The other variables in the state (`t`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected by the loop head and remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples of (`a3`, `l3`), `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1**
