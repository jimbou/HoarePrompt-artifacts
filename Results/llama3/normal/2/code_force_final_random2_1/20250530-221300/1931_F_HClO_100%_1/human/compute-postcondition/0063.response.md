Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is an integer, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1`, `idx1` is an integer and is either -1 or a value between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `idx2` is an integer and is either -1 or a value between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `i` is now `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has reached its final iteration. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 (if no match was found) or a value between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), indicating the index where a match was found. The values of `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, indicating whether a match was found in the previous iteration. The other variables remain unchanged.
