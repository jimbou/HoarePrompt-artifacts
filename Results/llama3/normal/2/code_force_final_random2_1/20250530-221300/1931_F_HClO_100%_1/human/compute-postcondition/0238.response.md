To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `_`. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable, its state is not important. What's important is the range `m - 2`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range `m - 2`. If `m - 2` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `m - 2` must be greater than 0, which means `m` must be at least 3.

Since `m` is already at least 3, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to adjust the state of `_` to indicate that it has been incremented. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we can simply set it to 1 (its initial value is 0).

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either `n` - 2 or `n` - 1 or `i`, `idx2` is either `n` - 2 or `n` - 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is `n` - 1, `stdin` is empty, `m` - 1 inputs have been read and discarded, and one more input has been read and discarded.**
