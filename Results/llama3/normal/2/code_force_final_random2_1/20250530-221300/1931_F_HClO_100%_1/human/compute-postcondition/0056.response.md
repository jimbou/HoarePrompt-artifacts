Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is an integer, n is an integer and must be at least 3, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, i is an integer and is 2, idx1 is an integer and is 2, p1 is an integer and is 1.**

In this output state, the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, and `i` retain their initial values as they are not modified by the code. The code only introduces two new variables, `idx1` and `p1`, and assigns them the values of `i` and 1, respectively.
