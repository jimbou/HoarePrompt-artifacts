Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers, and the current value of `m` is 1, stdin contains one less input, 'yes' is printed, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one less input. The 'yes' is still printed. However, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move on to the next iteration.
