Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is either 1 or m - 2, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, i is 1, stdin is empty, m - 1 inputs have been read and discarded, idx2 is 1, p2 is 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `idx2` and `p2`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`, making `idx2` equal to 1. The second line assigns the value of 1 to `p2`, making `p2` equal to 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values as specified in the precondition.
