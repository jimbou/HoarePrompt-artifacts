Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is either 1 or `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing a tuple of `(a3, l3)`, stdin is empty, `m - 1` inputs have been read and discarded. If `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. If `idx1` is `n - 1` and `idx2` is `n - 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is `n - 1` and `idx2` is `n - 2`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, then `l2` contains `a2` at index `idx1`, and `l` is equal to `l2`. If `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, then if `m` is 2, 'yes' is printed and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, then `l1` contains `a1` at the `idx2` position. If `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, then if `m` is not 2, the state of the variables remains unchanged. After the if-else block, `l1` contains `a1` at the `idx2` position if `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)`, otherwise `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 1, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 3, i is n - 1, val is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3), where a3 is an integer and l3 is a list of integers from the input, stdin is empty, m - 1 inputs have been read and discarded.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 3, i is n - 1, val is a list containing two tuples of (a3, l3), where a3 is an integer and l3 is a list of integers from the input, stdin is empty, m inputs have been read and discarded.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 3, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 4, i is n - 1, val is a list containing three tuples of (a3, l3), where a3 is an integer and l3 is a list of integers from the input, stdin is empty, m inputs have been read and discarded.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
