Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is m - 2, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either n - 2 or n - 1 or i, `idx2` is either n - 2 or n - 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples (a3, l3) and (a4, l4), `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, `i` is n - 1, `stdin` is empty, `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded, `a4` is an integer and is the first integer from the fourth input, `l4` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the fourth input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement.
