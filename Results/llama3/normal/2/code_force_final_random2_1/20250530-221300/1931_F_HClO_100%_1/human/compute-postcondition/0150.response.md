Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 1`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `1` or `0`, `p2` is either `1` or `0`, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples of `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `n` must be at least `2`, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, `i` is `0`, `stdin` is empty, `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded. Either `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `idx1` is `i`, `p1` is `1`, `p2` is `0` or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is `0`, `p2` is `1`. Either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. The current values of `idx1` and `idx2` are both greater than or equal to `0`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain the same, and the conditions that were true before the break statement are still true.
