Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 1`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1` or `i`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` is empty, `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is `n - 1` and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx2` is `n - 1` and `p2` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is either `n - 1` or `i`. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `idx2` is updated to `n - 2`. The value of `idx1` remains either `n - 2`, `n - 1`, or `i`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement are updated based on the new value of `idx2`.
