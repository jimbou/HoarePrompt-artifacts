Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing 1 tuple of (`a3`, `l3`), `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1, stdin is empty and `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `_` has reached `m - 2`, indicating that the loop has completed `m - 2` iterations. The input has been read and discarded `m - 2` times, leaving the standard input empty. The list `val` now contains only one tuple, which is the last tuple that was added before the loop started. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
