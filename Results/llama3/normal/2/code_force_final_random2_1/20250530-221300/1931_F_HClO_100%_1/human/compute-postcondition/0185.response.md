Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is m - 1, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and contains all integers from the second input except a1, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, idx1 is either n - 2 or n - 1 or i, idx2 is either n - 2 or n - 1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, n is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, i is n - 1, stdin is empty, m - 2 inputs have been read and discarded. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2 and l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, then the current value of idx1 is n - 1 and the current value of idx2 is n - 1. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2 but l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1, then the current value of idx1 is n - 1 and the current value of p1 is 1. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to a2 but l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, then the current value of idx2 is n - 1 and the current value of p2 is 1. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to a2 and l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1, then the current value of idx1 is either n - 1 or i and the current value of idx2 is either n - 2 or n - 1. The current value of idx1 is less than the current value of idx2. l2 contains a2 at index idx1, l is a list of integers and is equal to l2.**

The code inserts `a2` at index `idx1` in `l2` and assigns the updated `l2` to `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
