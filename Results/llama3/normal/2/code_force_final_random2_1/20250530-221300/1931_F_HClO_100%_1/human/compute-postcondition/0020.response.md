Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `stdin` is empty, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22, and 'no' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables. The only effect of the `continue` statement is to skip to the next iteration of the loop, without executing any further code in the current iteration.
