Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple of `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the first list from the first tuple in `val`, 'no' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The values of `t`, `_`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain the same. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
