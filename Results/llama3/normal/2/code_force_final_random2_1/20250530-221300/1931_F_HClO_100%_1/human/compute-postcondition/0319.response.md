To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`, so we can only adjust the state of `_` and `m`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 3, and `_` is 1.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `m` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 3, `i` is `n` - 1, `val` is a list containing a tuple of (`a3`, `l3`), where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `stdin` is empty, `m` - 1 inputs have been read and discarded.**
