Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is an integer, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, stdin contains one less input than before. If l11 is not equal to l22, _ is set to m - 2, m is at least 2, stdin is empty, 'no' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
