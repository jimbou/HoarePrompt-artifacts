Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 1`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1` or `i`, `idx2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers, `m - 1` inputs have been read and discarded, `a3` is an integer and is the first integer from the third input, `l3` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the third input.**

The code reads a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers.
