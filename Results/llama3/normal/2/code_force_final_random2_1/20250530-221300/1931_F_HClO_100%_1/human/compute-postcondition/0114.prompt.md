Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is m - 2, n is an integer and must be at least 3, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, i is an integer and is n - 1, p1 is an integer and is either 0 or 1, p2 is an integer and is either 0 or 1, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, stdin contains no input, m must be greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1`, `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of (a3, l3), `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `m` must be greater than 1, (a3, l3) is the first tuple in the list `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1`, `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of (a3, l3), `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the second tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the second tuple in the list `val`, `m` must be greater than 1. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1`, `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples of (a3, l3), `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the third tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the third tuple in the list `val`, `m` must be greater than 1. If `l3` is not equal to a list of integers excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
