Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is m - 1, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, idx1 is either i or -1, idx2 is either i or -1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list val, l3 is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list val, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, i is 1, stdin is empty, m - 2 inputs have been read and discarded. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2, then idx1 is i and p1 is 1. Otherwise, idx1 is either i or -1 and p1 is either 0 or 1. If l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, then idx2 is i and p2 is 1. Otherwise, idx2 is either i or -1 and p2 is either 0 or 1.***
