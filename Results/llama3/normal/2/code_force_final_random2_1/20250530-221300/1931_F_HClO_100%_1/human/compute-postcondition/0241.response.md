Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either `n` - 2 or `n` - 1 or `i`, `idx2` is either `n` - 2 or `n` - 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is at least 4, `i` is `n` - 1, `stdin` is empty, `m` - 1 inputs have been read and discarded, and one more input has been read and discarded, and one more input has been read and discarded, and one more input has been read and discarded.**

The code `input()` reads and discards one more input from `stdin`. Since `stdin` is already empty, this operation does not change the state of the program. All variables remain unchanged, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that one more input has been read and discarded.
