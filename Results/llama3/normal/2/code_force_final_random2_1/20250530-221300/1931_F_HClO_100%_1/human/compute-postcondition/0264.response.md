Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is either 1 or `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, `i` is 0, stdin is empty, `m - 1` inputs have been read and discarded. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.***
