Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 3, i is n - 1, val is a list containing two tuples of (a3, l3), where a3 is an integer and l3 is a list of integers from the input, stdin is empty, m inputs have been read and discarded.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `val` is updated to contain two tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers from the input. The `stdin` is still empty, and `m` inputs have been read and discarded.
