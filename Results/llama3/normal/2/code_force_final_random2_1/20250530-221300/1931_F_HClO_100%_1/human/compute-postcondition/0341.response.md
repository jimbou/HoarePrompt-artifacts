Output State: **t is 0, _ is m - 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, n is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, i is n - 1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list val, l3 is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list val, stdin is empty, m inputs have been read and processed. If all iterations of the loop completed without breaking, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases (t is 0), and for each test case, it has read and processed all the inputs (m inputs have been read and processed, stdin is empty). The loop has also checked if the lists of integers are equal after removing the first element of each list (l11 and l22 are lists of integers and contain all integers from l1 and l2 except a2 and a1 respectively). If all iterations of the loop completed without breaking, it means that all the lists of integers are equal, and 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, it means that at least one list of integers is not equal, and 'no' is printed.
