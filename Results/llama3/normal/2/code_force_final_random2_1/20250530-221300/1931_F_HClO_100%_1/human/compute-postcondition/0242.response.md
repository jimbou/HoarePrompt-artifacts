Output State: `_` is `m - 2`, `m` is an integer and is at least `m`, `stdin` is empty, `m - 1` inputs have been read and discarded, and `m - 2` more inputs have been read and discarded.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `_` has reached `m - 2`, indicating that the loop has executed `m - 2` times. The value of `m` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop. The standard input `stdin` is empty, and a total of `m - 1` inputs have been read and discarded, with `m - 2` additional inputs being read and discarded during the loop's execution.
