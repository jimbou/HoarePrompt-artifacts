Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is an integer, n is an integer and must be at least 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is -1, idx2 is i, p1 is 0, p2 is 1, stdin is empty.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `idx2` and sets `p2` to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between variables specified in the initial state still hold, as the code does not modify them.
