To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 2` is at least 1, meaning `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains one less input than before, `m` is an integer and is at least 3, and the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22**
