Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 1`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples of `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and the current value of `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`.***
