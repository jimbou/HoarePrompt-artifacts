To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for (a3, l3) in val:`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `val` list. If `val` has at least 3 tuples, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `val` has at least 2 tuples, `a3` is the first integer from the second tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the first list from the second tuple in `val`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must have at least 3 tuples, and the loop will iterate over the third tuple. Therefore, we need to adjust the states of `a3` and `l3` to be the first integer and the first list from the third tuple in `val`, respectively.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples of `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the first list from the third tuple in `val`.**
