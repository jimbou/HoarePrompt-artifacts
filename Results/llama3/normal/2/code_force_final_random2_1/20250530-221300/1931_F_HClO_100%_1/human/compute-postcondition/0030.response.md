Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is an integer, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `stdin` is empty. If the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing. The current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the current value of `l2[i + p2]`. Additionally, either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`***
