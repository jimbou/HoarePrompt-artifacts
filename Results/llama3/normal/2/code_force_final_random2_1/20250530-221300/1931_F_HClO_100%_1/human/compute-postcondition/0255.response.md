Output State: **idx1 is i, idx2 is i, all other variables remain unchanged**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `idx1 = idx2 = i`. This line assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Since `i` is 0, both `idx1` and `idx2` become 0. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1. The value of `_` is still either 1 or `m - 2`. The values of `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `n`, `m`, and `i` remain the same as before the code execution. The stdin is still empty, and `m - 1` inputs have been read and discarded. The condition that the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1` is still true. The element at index `i + p1` in `l1` is still equal to `a2`, and the element at index `i + p2` in `l2` is still equal to `a1`.
