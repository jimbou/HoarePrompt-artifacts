Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers, and the current value of `m` is 1, stdin contains one less input.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. However, the `input()` function consumes one input from stdin, so the number of inputs in stdin is reduced by one.
