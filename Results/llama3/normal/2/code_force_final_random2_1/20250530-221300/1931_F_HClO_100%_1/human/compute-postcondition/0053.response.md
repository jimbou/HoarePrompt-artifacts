Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is an integer, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer and is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which does not affect the values of the variables.
