Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is either 1 or m - 2, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, i is n - 1, stdin is empty, m - 1 inputs have been read and discarded. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is n - 1 and idx2 is n - 1. If idx1 and idx2 are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2], the values of idx1, idx2, p1, and p2 remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until it reaches the end of the input lists `l1` and `l2`. If at any point `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` will be set to `n - 1` and the loop will break. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, the loop will also break. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` will remain unchanged. The loop will iterate `n - 1` times, where `n` is the length of the input list `l1`.
