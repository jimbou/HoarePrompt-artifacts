The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is an integer, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1`, `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, then `l` is a list of integers equal to `l2` with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`. If `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, then if `idx1` > `idx2`, `l` is a list of integers equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. If `idx1` <= `idx2`, then if `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)`, then `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `l` is a list of integers and is equal to `l2` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`. If `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is updated to `n - 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made. So for the loop to be executed  the variable `m` must be at least 3 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1`, `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing a tuple of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, then `l` is a list of integers equal to `l2` with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`. If `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, then if `idx1` > `idx2`, `l` is a list of integers equal to `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. If `idx1` <= `idx2`, then if `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)`, then `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.

Otherwise, no changes are made, `m` is an integer and must be at least 3**
