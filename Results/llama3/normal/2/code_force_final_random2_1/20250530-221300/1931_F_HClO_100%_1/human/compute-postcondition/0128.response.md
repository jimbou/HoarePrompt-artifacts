Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples of (`a3`, `l3`), `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the second last tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the second last tuple in the list `val`, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1, stdin is empty and an input has been read and discarded.**

The code `input()` reads and discards an input from the standard input. Since the stdin is empty, this operation does not affect any variables. The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that an input has been read and discarded, which is reflected in the output state.
