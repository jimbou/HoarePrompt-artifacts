You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is m - 1, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, idx1 is either n - 2 or n - 1 or i, idx2 is either n - 2 or n - 1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, n is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, i is n - 1, stdin is empty, m - 2 inputs have been read and discarded. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2 and l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, then the current value of idx1 is n - 1 and the current value of idx2 is n - 1. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2 but l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1, then the current value of idx1 is n - 1 and the current value of p1 is 1. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to a2 but l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, then the current value of idx2 is n - 1 and the current value of p2 is 1. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to a2 and l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1, then the current value of idx1 is either n - 1 or i and the current value of idx2 is either n - 2 or n - 1. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 contains a2 at index idx1, l is a list of integers and is equal to l2. If idx1 > idx2, then l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, _ is m - 2, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3), m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers, a3 is an integer and is the first integer from the third input, l3 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the third input. If the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, l is a list of integers and is equal to l1. Otherwise, l is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1 and a2 and a2 is inserted at idx1.
```
for _ in range(m - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
