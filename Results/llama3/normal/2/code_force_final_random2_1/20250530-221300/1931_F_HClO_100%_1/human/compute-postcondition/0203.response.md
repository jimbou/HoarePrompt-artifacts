Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is m - 1, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, idx1 is either n - 2 or n - 1 or i, idx2 is either n - 2 or n - 1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, n is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, i is n - 1, stdin is empty, m - 2 inputs have been read and discarded. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2 and l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, then the current value of idx1 is n - 1 and the current value of idx2 is n - 1. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2 but l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1, then the current value of idx1 is n - 1 and the current value of p1 is 1. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to a2 but l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, then the current value of idx2 is n - 1 and the current value of p2 is 1. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to a2 and l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1, then the current value of idx1 is either n - 1 or i and the current value of idx2 is either n - 2 or n - 1. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 contains a2 at index idx1, l is a list of integers and is equal to l2. If idx1 > idx2, then l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, _ is m - 2, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3), m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers, a3 is an integer and is the first integer from the third input, l3 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the third input. If the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, l is a list of integers and is equal to l1. Otherwise, l is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1 and a2 and a2 is inserted at idx1.***
