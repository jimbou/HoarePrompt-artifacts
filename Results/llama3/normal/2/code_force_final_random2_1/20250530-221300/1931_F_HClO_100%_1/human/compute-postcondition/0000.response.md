Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n * k <= 2 * 10^5) followed by k lines, each containing n distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains t test cases, each consisting of two integers n and k, followed by k lines of n distinct integers from 1 to n. The values of n and k, as well as the contents of the test cases, remain unchanged.
