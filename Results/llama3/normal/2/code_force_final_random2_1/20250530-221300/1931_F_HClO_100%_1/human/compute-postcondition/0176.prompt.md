Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is m - 1, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list val, l3 is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list val, n is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, i is an integer and is n - 1, stdin is empty, m - 2 inputs have been read and discarded.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 1`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples of `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, either `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `idx1` is `i`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0 or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 1`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either `i` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `i` or `-1`, `p1` is either `0` or `1`, `p2` is either `0` or `1`, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples of `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, `i` is 1, stdin is empty, `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, either `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `idx1` is `i`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0 or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 1`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either 2 or `i`, `idx2` is either 2 or `i`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples of (`a3`, `l3`), `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, `i` is 2, stdin is empty, `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 2 and `idx2` is 2. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 2 and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx2` is 2 and `p2` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is either 2 or `i` and `idx2` is either 2 or `i`. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
