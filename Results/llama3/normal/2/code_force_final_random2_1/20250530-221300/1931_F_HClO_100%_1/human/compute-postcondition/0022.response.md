Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is an integer, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, stdin is empty.**

The code initializes four new variables: idx1, idx2, p1, and p2. The values of idx1 and idx2 are set to -1, indicating that no index has been found or assigned yet. The values of p1 and p2 are set to 0, indicating that no progress or position has been tracked or updated yet. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged, retaining their previous values and states.
