Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is m - 2, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either n - 2 or n - 1 or i, `idx2` is either n - 2 or n - 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples (a3, l3) and (a4, l4), `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, `i` is n - 1, `stdin` is empty, `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded, `a4` is an integer and is the first integer from the fourth input, `l4` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the fourth input. If the current value of `l4` is not equal to the list of integers from `l` excluding `a4`, then 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and 'no' is printed**
