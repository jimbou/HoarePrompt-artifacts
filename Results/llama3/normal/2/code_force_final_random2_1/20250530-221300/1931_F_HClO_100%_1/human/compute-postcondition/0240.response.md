The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `m`. If `_` is less than `m` - 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be at least 4.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either `n` - 2 or `n` - 1 or `i`, `idx2` is either `n` - 2 or `n` - 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is at least 4, `i` is `n` - 1, `stdin` is empty, `m` - 1 inputs have been read and discarded, and one more input has been read and discarded, and one more input has been read and discarded.**
