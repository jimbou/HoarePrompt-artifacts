Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is 0, n and m are integers, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, stdin contains one less input than before.**

The code reads two lines of input from stdin, each containing a list of integers. The first line is split into a1 and l1, and the second line is split into a2 and l2. The lists l11 and l22 are created by filtering out the elements that are equal to a2 and a1, respectively. The values of t, _, n, and m remain unchanged. The number of inputs in stdin is reduced by two.
