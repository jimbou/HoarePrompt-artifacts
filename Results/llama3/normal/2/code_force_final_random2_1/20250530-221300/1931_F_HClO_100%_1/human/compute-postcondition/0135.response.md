Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is m - 1, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, val is a list containing m - 1 tuples of (a3, l3), a3 is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list val, l3 is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list val, n is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, i is an integer and is n - 1, stdin is empty, m - 2 inputs have been read and discarded.**

The code initializes idx1 and idx2 to -1 and sets p1 and p2 to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
