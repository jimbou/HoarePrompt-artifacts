Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is either 1 or `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing a tuple of `(a3, l3)`, stdin is empty, `m - 1` inputs have been read and discarded. If `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. If `idx1` is `n - 1` and `idx2` is `n - 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is `n - 1` and `idx2` is `n - 2`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, then `l2` contains `a2` at index `idx1`, and `l` is equal to `l2`. If `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, then if `m` is 2, 'yes' is printed and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, then `l1` contains `a1` at the `idx2` position. If `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, then if `m` is not 2, the state of the variables remains unchanged. After the if-else block, `l1` contains `a1` at the `idx2` position if `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)`, otherwise `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.***
