Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is either 1 or m - 2, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, idx1 is either -1 or 0, idx2 is either -1 or i, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, n must be at least 2, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, i is 0, stdin is empty, m - 1 inputs have been read and discarded. The current value of i plus the maximum of p1 and p2 does not equal n - 1. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2, then idx1 is 0 and p1 is 1. Otherwise, idx2 is i and p2 is 1.***
