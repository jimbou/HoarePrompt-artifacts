Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 1`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either 2 or `i`, `idx2` is either 2 or `i`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples of (`a3`, `l3`), `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input, `i` is 2, stdin is empty, `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 2 and `idx2` is 2. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 2 and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx2` is 2 and `p2` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is either 2 or `i` and `idx2` is either 2 or `i`. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
