Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is either 1 or `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `val` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, `i` is 0, stdin is empty, `m - 1` inputs have been read and discarded, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is currently in. Since there are no changes to the values of the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
