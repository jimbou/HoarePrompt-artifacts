Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when there are more than two screenshots and the order of participants is not consistent across all screenshots. 

For example, consider the case where n = 5, k = 3, and the screenshots are:

1 2 3 4 5
2 1 3 4 5
3 1 2 4 5

In this case, the program will incorrectly output "yes" because it only checks the consistency of the order between the first two screenshots and does not consider the third screenshot. However, there is no possible order of participants that can produce all three screenshots.

The program should check the consistency of the order across all screenshots, not just the first two. It should also handle the case where there are more than two screenshots and the order is not consistent across all of them.
