Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is either 1 or m - 2, a1 is an integer and is the first integer from the input, l1 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, a2 is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, l2 is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, i is 2, stdin is empty, m - 1 inputs have been read and discarded. If l1[i + p1] equals a2 and l2[i + p2] equals a1, then idx1 is 2 and idx2 is 2. If idx1 and idx2 are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of idx1, idx2, p1, and p2 remain unchanged.**
