According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is equal to the second integer from the input and is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed, `m` must be at least 3 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `p1` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `p2` is an integer and is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples of (`a3`, `l3`), `a3` is an integer and is the first element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `l3` is a list of integers and is the second element of the last tuple in the list `val`, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input and is at least 3, `i` is an integer and is `n - 1**
