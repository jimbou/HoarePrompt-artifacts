Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, _ is an integer, n is an integer and must be at least 3, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, i is an integer and is n - 1, p1 is an integer and is either 0 or 1, p2 is an integer and is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, a2 is an integer, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, idx1 is not less than idx2, idx1 is less than or equal to idx2, If idx1 is not -1 and idx2 is -1, then idx2 is updated to n - 2. Otherwise, no changes are made. l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2.**

The code modifies the list `l1` by inserting the value of `a1` at the index `idx2`. This change is then reflected in the new variable `l`, which is assigned the modified list `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
