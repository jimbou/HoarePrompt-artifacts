Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is an integer, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer and is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`, no change occurs. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is an integer and is 1, `idx2` is an integer and is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is an integer and is 1, `p1` is an integer and is 1. If `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx2` is an integer and is 1, `p2` is an integer and is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
