Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is an integer, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `i`. Otherwise, if both `idx1` and `idx2` are not -1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement.***
