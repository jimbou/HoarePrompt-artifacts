Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, _ is m - 2, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l1 except a2, l22 is a list of integers and contains all integers from l2 except a1, n must be at least 3, m is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 3, i is n - 1, val is a list containing m - 2 tuples of (a3, l3), where a3 is an integer and l3 is a list of integers from the input, stdin is empty, m - 1 inputs have been read and discarded.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple of `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the first list from the first tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers from `l` excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state of variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the first list from the second tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers from `l` excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without any changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1 and is at least 3, `i` is `n - 1`, `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples of `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the first list from the third tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers from `l` excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution without any changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
