Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `_` is m - 2, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either n - 2 or n - 1 or i, `idx2` is either n - 2 or n - 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples (a3, l3), (a4, l4), and (a5, l5), `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, `i` is n - 1, `stdin` is empty, `m - 2` inputs have been read and discarded, `a5` is an integer and is the first integer from the fifth input, `l5` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the fifth input, and 'no' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
