Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a1` is an integer and is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the input, `a2` is an integer and is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of integers and is the rest of the integers from the second input, `l11` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l1` except `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers and contains all integers from `l2` except `a1`, `idx1` is either n - 2 or n - 1 or i, `idx2` is either n - 2 or n - 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer from the input, `m` is an integer and is equal to the second integer from the input minus 1, `i` is n - 1, `stdin` is empty, `m - 1` inputs have been read and discarded.**

The code reads an input from stdin and discards it. Since stdin is already empty, this operation does not change the state of the program. The values of all variables remain the same, and no new variables are introduced. The loop is not affected by this operation, and the program continues to the next statement.
