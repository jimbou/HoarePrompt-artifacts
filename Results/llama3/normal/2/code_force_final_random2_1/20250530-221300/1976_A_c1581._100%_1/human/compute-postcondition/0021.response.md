The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `len(digits)`. If `i` is less than `len(digits)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(digits)`, so `i` must be increased by 1, and `i` is 1. Also, `digits` must have at least 2 digits for `i` to be less than `len(digits)`.
State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password that must have at least 2 digits, `letters` is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password, `i` is 1, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`**
