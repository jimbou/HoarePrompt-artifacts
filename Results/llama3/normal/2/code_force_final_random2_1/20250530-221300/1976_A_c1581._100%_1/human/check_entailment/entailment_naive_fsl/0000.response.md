Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter. The current implementation only checks if the last digit is greater than any of the letters, which is not sufficient. 

For example, the input "a1b2" would be incorrectly classified as a strong password by the program, because it does not check if there is a digit that comes after a letter. 

To fix this, the program should check if there is a digit that comes after a letter in the original password, not just in the sorted digits and letters. 

Here is a possible correction:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    sortedPassword = ''.join(letters + digits)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected version first sorts the digits and letters separately, then combines them in the correct order (letters first, then digits). It then checks if the sorted password is equal to the original password. If they are equal, then the password is strong; otherwise, it is not.
