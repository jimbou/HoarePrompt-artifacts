Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password, letters is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(digits)):
    if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
        return False
    if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
        return False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password that must have at least 1 digit, `letters` is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password, `i` is 0, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password that must have at least 2 digits, `letters` is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password. If the list of digits is not sorted in ascending order, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program returns False if `i` is less than the second last index of `digits` and the digit at index `i` is greater than the digit at index `i+1`. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning any value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
