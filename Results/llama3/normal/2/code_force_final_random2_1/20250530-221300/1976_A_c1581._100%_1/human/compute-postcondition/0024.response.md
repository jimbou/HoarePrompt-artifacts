To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(digits)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the `digits` list.

At the end of the previous iteration, `digits` is a sorted list containing at least 2 digits. Since the loop is iterating over the indices of the `digits` list, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a sorted list containing at least 2 digits, `letters` is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password, `i` is 1**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `i`, as it is the only variable involved in the loop head. The states of `password`, `digits`, and `letters` remain unchanged.
