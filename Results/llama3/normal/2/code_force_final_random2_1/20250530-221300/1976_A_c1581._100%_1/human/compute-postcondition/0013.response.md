Output State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 characters, char is the third character in the password. If char is a digit, then digits is a list containing the first, second and third characters of the password and letters is a list containing the third character of the password. If char is not a digit, then digits is a list containing the first and second characters of the password and letters is a list containing the first, second and third characters of the password.**

In this output state, the code has appended the third character of the password (char) to the list of letters. If char is a digit, it was already included in the list of digits, so the list of digits remains the same, but the list of letters now includes char. If char is not a digit, it was already included in the list of letters, so the list of letters remains the same, but the list of digits remains the same as well. The password and char variables remain unchanged.
