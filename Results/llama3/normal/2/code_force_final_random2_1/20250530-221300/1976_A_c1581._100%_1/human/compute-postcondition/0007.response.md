According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the password. If the password has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, password has at least 1 character, char is the first character in the password. So for the loop to be executed one more time the password must have at least 2 characters and the char is the second character in the password. If char is a digit, then digits is a list containing the first and second characters of the password and letters is an empty list. Otherwise, digits is a list containing the first character of the password and letters is a list containing the second character of the password.
