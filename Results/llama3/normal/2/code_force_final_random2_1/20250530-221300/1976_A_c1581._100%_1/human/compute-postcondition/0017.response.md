To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `digits`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `digits`. If `digits` has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password, and `letters` is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password that must have at least 1 digit, `letters` is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password, `i` is 0**
