Output State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 characters, char is the second character in the password. If char is a digit, then digits is a list containing the first and second characters of the password and letters is a list containing the second character of the password. Otherwise, digits is a list containing the first character of the password and letters is a list containing the first and second characters of the password.**

In this output state, the code has appended the second character of the password (char) to the list of letters. If char is a digit, it was already in the list of digits, and now it is also in the list of letters. If char is not a digit, it was already in the list of letters, and now it is still in the list of letters, but also the first character of the password is in the list of digits. The password and char variables remain unchanged.
