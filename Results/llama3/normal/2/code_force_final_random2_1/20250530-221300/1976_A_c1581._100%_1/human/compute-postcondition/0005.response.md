Output State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character, digits is an empty list, letters is a list containing the first character of the password which is not a digit, char is the first character in the password and is not a digit.**

The code appends the value of `char` to the `letters` list. Since `char` is the first character in the `password` and is not a digit, the `letters` list now contains this character. The other variables remain unchanged. The `password` still consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits and has at least 1 character. The `digits` list is still empty.
