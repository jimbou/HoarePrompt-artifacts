Checks if a given password string is sorted alphabetically and numerically. The function accepts a password string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and returns True if the password is sorted and False otherwise. It performs the following actions: separates the password into digits and letters, sorts them individually, and then checks if the sorted digits and letters are in the correct order within the original password. If the sorted password matches the original password, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
