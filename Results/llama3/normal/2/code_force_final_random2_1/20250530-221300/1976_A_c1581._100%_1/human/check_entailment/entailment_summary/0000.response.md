Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to check if a given password string meets certain conditions: it should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, there should be no digit that comes after a letter, all digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order, and all letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program defines a function `func_1(password)` that separates the password into digits and letters, sorts them individually, and then checks if the sorted digits and letters are in the correct order within the original password. If the sorted password matches the original password, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

However, there is a logical error in the function. The condition `if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:` is unnecessary and can cause incorrect results. The `sort()` function is already used to sort the digits, so this condition is redundant.

Moreover, the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is also incorrect. It checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, which is not a correct condition according to the problem statement. The correct condition should be that there should be no digit that comes after a letter.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
