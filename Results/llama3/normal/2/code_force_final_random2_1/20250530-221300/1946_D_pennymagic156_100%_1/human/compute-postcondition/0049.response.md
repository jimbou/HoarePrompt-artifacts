Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `t` is a list if `v` is true otherwise `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is either 0 or not equal to 0. If `u` is 0, then the loop will terminate when all elements in list `a` have been processed. The final state of the variables will be as follows: `n` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `a` will be an empty list, `t` will contain the XOR of all elements in `a` that have the same 30th bit, `ans` remains -1, `i` remains 29, `u` remains 0, `v` remains an even number, `op` will be the XOR of the 30th bits of all elements in `a`, and `ai` will be 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise it will be the XOR of all elements in `a` that have the same 30th bit. If `u` is not equal to 0, then if `v` is odd, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is even, `t` is a list if `v` is true otherwise `t` is an empty list. If `v` is true, `val` is the last element in the list `a`. `op` is equal to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and the result of the bitwise AND operation between the result of the right shift operation of `val` by `i` bits and 1. If `op` is false, `cnt` is equal to the number of elements in `a`, otherwise `cnt` is equal to the number of elements in `a` minus 1. If `v` is false, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
