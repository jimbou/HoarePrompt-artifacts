Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, a is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n and must have at least 2 elements, t is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, ans is -1, i is 29, u is 0, v is an even number, op is the result of op XOR the 30th bit of val, ai is 0, val is the second element in the list a.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

- The first line appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Since `ai` is the result of `ai` XOR `val`, and `val` is the second element in the list `a`, the value appended to `t` is the result of `ai` XOR `val`. The list `t` now contains this new value.
- The second line assigns the value 0 to `ai`. This changes the value of `ai` from its previous value to 0.

The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is still a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is still a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is still -1, `i` is still 29, `u` is still 0, `v` is still an even number, `op` is still the result of op XOR the 30th bit of val, and `val` is still the second element in the list `a`.
