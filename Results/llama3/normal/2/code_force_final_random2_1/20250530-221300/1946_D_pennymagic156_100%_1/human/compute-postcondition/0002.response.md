Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is either 0 or 1, `v` is an integer between 0 and n (inclusive)**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new variables `u` and `v` are introduced. `u` is assigned the value of the 29th bit of `x`, which can be either 0 or 1. `v` is assigned the sum of the 29th bits of all elements in the list `a`, which can be an integer between 0 and `n` (inclusive).
