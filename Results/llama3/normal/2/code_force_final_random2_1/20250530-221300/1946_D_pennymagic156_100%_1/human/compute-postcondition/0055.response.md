Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `t` is a list if `v` is true otherwise `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `u` is the 27th bit of `x`, and `v` is the sum of the 27th bits of all elements in `a`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. However, the values of `u` and `v` are updated. `u` is now the 27th bit of `x`, which is either 0 or 1. `v` is now the sum of the 27th bits of all elements in `a`, which is a non-negative integer.
