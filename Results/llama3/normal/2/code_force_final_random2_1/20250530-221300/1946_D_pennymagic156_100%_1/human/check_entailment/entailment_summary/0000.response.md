Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the input correctly using functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`, which are used to read a list of integers, an integer, and a map object containing a list of integers, respectively.

2. The program then uses function `func_5` to determine the maximum number of elements in the list `a` that have the same bit pattern as the given non-negative integer `x`. This function iterates through the bits of `x` from most significant to least significant and checks if the corresponding bits in the elements of `a` are the same. If they are, it counts the number of elements with the same bit pattern. If not, it splits the list `a` into two parts based on the bit pattern and continues the process recursively.

3. The program returns the maximum value between the maximum number of elements with the same bit pattern and the total number of elements in the list `a`. This is done by comparing the `ans` variable, which stores the maximum number of elements with the same bit pattern, with the length of the list `a`.

4. The program handles the edge case where `x` is 0 correctly by returning -1.

5. The program also handles the case where the length of the list `a` is 0 correctly by returning -1.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of elements in the list `a` that have the same bit pattern as the given non-negative integer `x`, and it handles the edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
