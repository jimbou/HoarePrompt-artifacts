Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `t` is a list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is true.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced two new variables, `op` and `cnt`, and assigned them the value 0.
