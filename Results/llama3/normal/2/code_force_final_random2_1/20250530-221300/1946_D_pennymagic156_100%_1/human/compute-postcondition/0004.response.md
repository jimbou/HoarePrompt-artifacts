The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since there are no changes to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is 0, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
