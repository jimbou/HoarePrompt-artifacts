Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and x are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= x < 2^30, a is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, t is an empty list, ans is -1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(29, -1, -1):
    u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
    if u == v == 0:
        continue
    if u == 0:
        if v % 2:
            return ans
        else:
            op = ai = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                ai ^= val
                if not op:
                    t.append(ai)
                    ai = 0
            a, t = t, []
    elif v % 2:
        continue
    elif v:
        op = cnt = 0
        for val in a:
            op ^= val >> i & 1
            if not op:
                cnt += 1
        ans = max(ans, cnt)
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `t` is a list if `v` is true otherwise `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is either 0 or not equal to 0. If `u` is 0, then the loop will terminate when all elements in list `a` have been processed. The final state of the variables will be as follows: `n` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `a` will be an empty list, `t` will contain the XOR of all elements in `a` that have the same 30th bit, `ans` remains -1, `i` remains 29, `u` remains 0, `v` remains an even number, `op` will be the XOR of the 30th bits of all elements in `a`, and `ai` will be 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise it will be the XOR of all elements in `a` that have the same 30th bit. If `u` is not equal to 0, then if `v` is odd, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is even, `t` is a list if `v` is true otherwise `t` is an empty list. If `v` is true, `val` is the last element in the list `a`. `op` is equal to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and the result of the bitwise AND operation between the result of the right shift operation of `val` by `i` bits and 1. If `op` is false, `cnt` is equal to the number of elements in `a`, otherwise `cnt` is equal to the number of elements in `a` minus 1. If `v` is false, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `t` is a list if `v` is true otherwise `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is either 0 or 1 (the 28th bit of `x`), and `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`. If both `u` and `v` are 0, we skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `t` is a list if `v` is true otherwise `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `u` is the 27th bit of `x`, and `v` is the sum of the 27th bits of all elements in `a`. If the 27th bit of `x` and the sum of the 27th bits of all elements in `a` are both 0, then the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
