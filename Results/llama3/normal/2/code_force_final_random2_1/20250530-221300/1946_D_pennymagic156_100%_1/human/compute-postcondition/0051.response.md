Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `t` is a list if `v` is true otherwise `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is either 0 or 1 (the 28th bit of `x`), and `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `u` is now either 0 or 1, depending on the 28th bit of `x`. The value of `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, which can be any non-negative integer. The value of `t` is still dependent on the value of `v`, but its exact value is not determined in this output state.
