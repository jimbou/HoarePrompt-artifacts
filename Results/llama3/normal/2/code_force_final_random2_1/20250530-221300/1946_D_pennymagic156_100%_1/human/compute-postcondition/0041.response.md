Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n and a must have at least 3 elements, `t` is a list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is true, `val` is the third element in the list `a`. `op` is equal to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and the result of the bitwise AND operation between the result of the right shift operation of `val` by `i` bits and 1. If `op` is false, `cnt` is 2, otherwise `cnt` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `op` has been updated based on the result of the bitwise operations involving `val`, `i`, and the previous value of `op`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `op` is now determined by the result of the bitwise XOR operation, which depends on the previous value of `op` and the result of the bitwise AND operation between the result of the right shift operation of `val` by `i` bits and 1.
