Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, a is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n and must have at least 3 elements, t is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, ans is -1, i is 29, u is 0, v is an even number, op is the result of op XOR the 30th bit of val, ai is 0.**

The code first appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Since `ai` is the result of `ai` XOR `val`, this operation adds the result of `ai` XOR `val` to the list `t`. Then, the value of `ai` is set to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
