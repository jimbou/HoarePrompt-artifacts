The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since we are directly inside a loop, we skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables do not change.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `t` is a list if `v` is true otherwise `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is either 0 or 1 (the 28th bit of `x`), and `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
