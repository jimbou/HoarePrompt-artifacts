Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n and a must have at least 1 element, `t` is a list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `op` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the previous value of `op` and the 30th bit of `val`, `cnt` is 0, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is true, `val` is the first element in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `op` has been updated to be the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and the 30th bit of `val`. The 30th bit of `val` is obtained by shifting `val` 29 bits to the right and then performing a bitwise AND operation with 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
