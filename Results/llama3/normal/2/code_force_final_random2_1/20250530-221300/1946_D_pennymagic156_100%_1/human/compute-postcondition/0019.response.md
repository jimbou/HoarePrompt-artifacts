Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n and must have at least 2 elements, `t` is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is an even number, `op` is the result of op XOR the 30th bit of val, `ai` is 0 if op is 0, otherwise `ai` is the result of ai XOR val, `val` is the second element in the list a.**
