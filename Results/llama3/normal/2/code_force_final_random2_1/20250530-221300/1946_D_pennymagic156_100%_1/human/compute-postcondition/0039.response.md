Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n and a must have at least 2 elements, `t` is a list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is true, `val` is the second element in the list `a`. If `op` is false, `cnt` is 2, otherwise `cnt` is 1.***
