Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is not equal to 0. If `v` is odd, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is even, `t` is a list if `v` is true otherwise `t` is an empty list. If `v` is true, `val` is the last element in the list `a`. `op` is equal to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and the result of the bitwise AND operation between the result of the right shift operation of `val` by `i` bits and 1. If `op` is false, `cnt` is equal to the number of elements in `a`, otherwise `cnt` is equal to the number of elements in `a` minus 1. If `v` is false, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
