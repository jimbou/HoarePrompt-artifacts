Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is not equal to 0, and `v` is an odd number, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to the values of the variables. The only effect of the `continue` statement is to skip to the next iteration of the loop, without executing any further code in the current iteration.
