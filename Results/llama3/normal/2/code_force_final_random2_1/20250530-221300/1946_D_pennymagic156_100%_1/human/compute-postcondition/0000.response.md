Output State: **n and x are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= x < 2^30, a is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, t is an empty list, ans is -1**

The code snippet provided consists of four lines. The first line calls the function `func_3()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `x`. The second line calls the function `func_1()` and assigns its return value to `a`. The third line initializes an empty list `t` and assigns the value `-1` to `ans`. 

The first line updates the values of `n` and `x` based on the return values of `func_3()`. Since the precondition states that `n` and `x` are non-negative integers within specific ranges, the new values of `n` and `x` will also be non-negative integers within those ranges.

The second line updates the value of `a` based on the return value of `func_1()`. Since the precondition states that `a` is a list of non-negative integers, the new value of `a` will also be a list of non-negative integers.

The third line initializes an empty list `t` and assigns the value `-1` to `ans`. This line does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, or `a`.

The fourth line does not exist in the given code snippet, so it does not affect the output state.

Therefore, the final output state includes the updated values of `n`, `x`, and `a`, as well as the newly initialized variables `t` and `ans`.
