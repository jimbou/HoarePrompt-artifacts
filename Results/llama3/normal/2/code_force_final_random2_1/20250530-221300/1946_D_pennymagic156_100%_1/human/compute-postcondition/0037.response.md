Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n and a must have at least 2 elements, `t` is a list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `cnt` is 1 if `op` is false, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is true, `val` is the second element in the list `a`, and `op` is the bitwise XOR of its previous value and the 29th bit of `val`.**

In this output state, the value of `op` has been updated based on the 29th bit of `val` (the second element in the list `a`). The 29th bit of `val` is obtained by shifting `val` 29 bits to the right (`val >> i`) and then performing a bitwise AND operation with 1 (`& 1`). The result of this operation is then bitwise XORed with the previous value of `op` (`op ^= ...`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
