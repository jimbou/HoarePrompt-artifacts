Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `t` is a list if `v` is true otherwise `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `u` is the 27th bit of `x`, and `v` is the sum of the 27th bits of all elements in `a`. If the 27th bit of `x` and the sum of the 27th bits of all elements in `a` are both 0, then the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
