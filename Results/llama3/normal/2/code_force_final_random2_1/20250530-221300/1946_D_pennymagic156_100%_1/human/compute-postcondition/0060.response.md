Functionality: **This function determines the maximum number of elements in a list 'a' that have the same bit pattern as a given non-negative integer 'x'. It iterates through the bits of 'x' from most significant to least significant, and for each bit, it checks if the corresponding bits in the elements of 'a' are the same. If they are, it counts the number of elements with the same bit pattern. If not, it splits the list 'a' into two parts based on the bit pattern and continues the process recursively. The function returns the maximum value between the maximum number of elements with the same bit pattern and the total number of elements in the list 'a'.**
