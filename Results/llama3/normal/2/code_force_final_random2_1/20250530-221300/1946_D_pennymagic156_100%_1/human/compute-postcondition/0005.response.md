Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29. If `u` is 0 and `v` is 0, then we move on to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `u` and `v`.***
