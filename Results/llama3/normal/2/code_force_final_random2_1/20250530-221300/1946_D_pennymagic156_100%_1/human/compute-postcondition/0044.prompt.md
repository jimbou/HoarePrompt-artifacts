Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, `t` is a list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is true.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    if not op:
        cnt += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n and a must have at least 1 element, `t` is a list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `cnt` is 1 if `op` is false, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is true, and `val` is the first element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n and a must have at least 2 elements, `t` is a list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is true, `val` is the second element in the list `a`. If `op` is false, `cnt` is 2, otherwise `cnt` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n and a must have at least 3 elements, `t` is a list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is true, `val` is the third element in the list `a`. `op` is equal to the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and the result of the bitwise AND operation between the result of the right shift operation of `val` by `i` bits and 1. If `op` is false, `cnt` is 3, otherwise `cnt` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
