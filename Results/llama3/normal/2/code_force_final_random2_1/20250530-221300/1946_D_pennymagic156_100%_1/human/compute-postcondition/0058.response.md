Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, a is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, t is a list if v is true otherwise t is an empty list, ans is the maximum number of elements in a that have the same bit pattern as x, i is -1, u is 0, and v is the sum of the 0th bits of all elements in a.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The number of elements in the list `a` remains unchanged.
* The value of `x` remains unchanged.
* The list `a` remains unchanged.
* The list `t` is either empty or contains the XOR of all elements in `a` that have the same bit pattern as `x`.
* The value of `ans` is the maximum number of elements in `a` that have the same bit pattern as `x`.
* The loop counter `i` is -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
* The variable `u` is 0, indicating that the 0th bit of `x` is 0.
* The variable `v` is the sum of the 0th bits of all elements in `a`.
