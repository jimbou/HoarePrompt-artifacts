The first line adds the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Since `ai` is the result of `ai` XOR `val`, and `val` is the first element in the list `a`, `t` now contains the result of `ai` XOR `val`. The second line assigns the value of `0` to `ai`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, a is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n and must have at least 1 element, t is a list containing the result of ai XOR val, ans is -1, i is 29, u is 0, v is an even number, op is 0, ai is 0, val is the first element in the list a.**
