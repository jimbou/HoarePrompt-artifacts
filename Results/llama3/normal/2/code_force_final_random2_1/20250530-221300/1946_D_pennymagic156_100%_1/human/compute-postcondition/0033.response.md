Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 10^5, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n and a must have at least 1 element, `t` is a list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `op` is false, `cnt` is 0, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is true, and `val` is the first element in the list `a`.**
