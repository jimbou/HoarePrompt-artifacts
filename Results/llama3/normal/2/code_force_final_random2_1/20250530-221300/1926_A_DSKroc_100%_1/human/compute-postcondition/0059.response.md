Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, q is 2, s is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the second character in the string s is 'A', then ac is 1 and bc is 1. If the second character in the string s is not 'A', then ac is 0 and bc is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `bc` now depends on the second character of the string `s`. If the second character is 'A', then `bc` is 1, otherwise, it is 2. The rest of the variables and stdin remain the same as in the initial state.
