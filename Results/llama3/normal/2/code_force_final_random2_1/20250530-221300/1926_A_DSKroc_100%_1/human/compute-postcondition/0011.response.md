Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `q` is 0, `s` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, stdin contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 1. If the first character of `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1. If the first character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is still 1 and `bc` is now 1. If the first character of `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is still 0 and `bc` is now 2. The values of `t`, `q`, and `s` remain unchanged, as well as the contents of stdin.
