Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character in the string, `i`, is 'A', then `ac` is either 2 or 1 and `bc` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `ac` is 0 and `bc` is either 2 or 3.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `ac` and `bc` are updated to reflect the new value of `bc`.
