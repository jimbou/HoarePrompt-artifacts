Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `q` is 0, `s` is a string of length 3 consisting of letters A and B, stdin contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is either 1 or 2 and `bc` is either 1 or 2. If the first character of `s` is not 'A', then `ac` is either 0 or 1 and `bc` is either 2 or 3.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1. If the first character of `s` is 'A', then `bc` can be either 1 or 2. If the first character of `s` is not 'A', then `bc` can be either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
