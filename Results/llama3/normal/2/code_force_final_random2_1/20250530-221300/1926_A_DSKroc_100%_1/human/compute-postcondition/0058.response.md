Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, q is 2, s is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, stdin contains t-5 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the second character in the string s is 'A', then ac is 2 and bc is 0. If the second character in the string s is not 'A', then ac is 1 and bc is 1.**

In this output state, the value of ac has been incremented by 1. If the second character in the string s is 'A', then ac is now 2, and bc remains 0. If the second character in the string s is not 'A', then ac is now 1, and bc remains 1. The values of t, q, s, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
