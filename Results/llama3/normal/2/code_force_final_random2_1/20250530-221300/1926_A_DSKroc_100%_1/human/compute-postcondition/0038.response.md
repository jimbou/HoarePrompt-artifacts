Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the first character in the string, `i`, is 'A', then `ac` is either 3 or 2 and `bc` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `ac` is 1 and `bc` is either 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ac` has been incremented by 1. If the first character in the string `i` is 'A', then `ac` can be either 3 or 2, and `bc` remains either 0 or 1. If the first character in the string `i` is 'B', then `ac` is now 1, and `bc` remains either 1 or 2. The values of `t`, `q`, `s`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
