Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. It then processes the second line of each test case, which contains a list of integers, and prints the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique item in the list by 3. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and the list of elements empty.**
