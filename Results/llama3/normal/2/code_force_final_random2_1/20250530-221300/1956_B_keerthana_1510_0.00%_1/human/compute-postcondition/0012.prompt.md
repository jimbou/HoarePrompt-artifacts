Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n). Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times.
Code of the loop:
for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
    elements = line.split()
    print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `elements` is a list of strings, stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) has at least 2 lines, and the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique item in the list `elements` by 3 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `elements` is a list of strings from the first line of the input, stdin contains multiple test cases excluding the first line, open(0) has at least 2 lines, and the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique item in the list `elements` by 3 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `elements` is a list of strings from the current line of the input, stdin contains multiple test cases excluding the current line, open(0) has at least 2 lines, and the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique item in the list `elements` by 3 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
