Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, processes the data, and prints the desired output. The program uses the fact that the maximum number of points a player can get is equal to the number of pairs of cards with the same integer that the player has, minus the number of triples of cards with the same integer that the player has (since in this case, the player can only get one point for the pair, not two). The program calculates this by counting the number of occurrences of each unique integer in the list, dividing by 3, and summing up the results. This is a correct and efficient solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
