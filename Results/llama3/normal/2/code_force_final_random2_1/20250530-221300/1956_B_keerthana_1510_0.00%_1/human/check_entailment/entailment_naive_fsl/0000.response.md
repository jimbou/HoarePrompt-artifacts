Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The problem description states that the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally is the answer. However, the program does not consider the optimal moves of Nene. It simply counts the number of elements that appear more than twice in the input list, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

For example, if the input is "1 1 2 2 3 3", the program will output 0, but the correct answer is 2. This is because you can play the two 1's first, and then Nene will play the two 2's, and then you can play the two 3's, scoring 2 points.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to use a greedy algorithm, where you always play the card that will give you the most points, considering the optimal moves of Nene.
