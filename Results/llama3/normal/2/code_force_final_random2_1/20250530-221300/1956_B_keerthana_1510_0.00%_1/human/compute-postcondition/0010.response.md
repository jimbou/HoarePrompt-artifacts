The code prints the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique item in the list `elements` by 3.
Since the exact `elements` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum.
Output: **sum of the integer division of the count of each unique item in the list elements by 3**
