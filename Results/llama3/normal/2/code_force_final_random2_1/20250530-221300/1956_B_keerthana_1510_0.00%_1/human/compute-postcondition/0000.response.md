The only objects in the loop head are variables  line and file object open(0). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object open(0). If the file object open(0) has at least 3 lines the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the file object open(0) must have at least 3 lines and the line is the third line.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) has at least 3 lines, line is the third line**
