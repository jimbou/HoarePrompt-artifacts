Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value. If check_all is True, 'YES' is printed. If check_all is False, then for each i in the range [1, n), if a[i - 1] is greater than a[i], either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed and the loop has been exited. Otherwise, the loop has completed all iterations without printing anything, and i is set to n - 1.**
