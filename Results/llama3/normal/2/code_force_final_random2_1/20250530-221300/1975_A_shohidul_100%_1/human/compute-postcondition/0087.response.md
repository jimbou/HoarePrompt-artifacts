Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 1, new is a list of n - 1 integers, check_all_new is a boolean value, new_all is a boolean value.**

The code snippet executes three lines, each affecting different variables. The first line assigns a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` to the variable `new`. Since `i` is 1, `new` becomes a list of `n - 1` integers. The second line calculates a boolean value `check_all_new` by comparing the first element of `a` with each element in `new`. The third line calculates another boolean value `new_all` by comparing each element in `new` with its previous element. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, and `i` remain unchanged.
