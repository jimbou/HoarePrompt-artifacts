Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is not set
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 1. If a[i - 1] > a[i], either 'YES' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 2. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if check_all_new and new_all are both true, otherwise 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is a boolean value, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both true. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then nothing is printed and the most internal loop or if statement continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
