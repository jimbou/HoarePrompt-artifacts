Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then a new list `new` of `n - 2` integers is created, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then no action is taken.***
