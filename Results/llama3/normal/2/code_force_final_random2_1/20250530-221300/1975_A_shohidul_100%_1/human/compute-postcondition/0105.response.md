Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is a boolean value, `i` is 2, `new` is a list of `n - 2` integers, `check_all_new` is a boolean value, `new_all` is a boolean value, 'NO' has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, and 'NO' has been printed. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
