To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is at least 2, it must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is false, `i` is 3**
