Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 2, new is a list of n - 2 integers, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of a is greater than or equal to all elements in new, new_all is a boolean value indicating whether new is sorted in non-decreasing order. If both check_all_new and new_all are true, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
