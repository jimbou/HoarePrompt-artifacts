Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 1, new is a list of n - 1 integers, check_all_new is a boolean value, new_all is a boolean value. If both check_all_new and new_all are true, 'YES' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either check_all_new is false or new_all is false, 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
