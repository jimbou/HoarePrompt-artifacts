Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 2, `new` is a list of `n - 2` integers, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'YES' is being printed.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, and we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement due to the `break` statement. The printing of 'YES' is still in effect.
