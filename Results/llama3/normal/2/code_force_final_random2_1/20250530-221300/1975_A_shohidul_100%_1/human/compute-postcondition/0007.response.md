To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1). 

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order and is false, `i` is 1**
