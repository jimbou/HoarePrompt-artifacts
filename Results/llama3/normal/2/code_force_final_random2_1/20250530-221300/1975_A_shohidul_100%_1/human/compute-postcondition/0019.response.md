Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers, check_all is false, i is 1. If the first element of a is greater than the second element of a, then 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the list new (which is a list of n-1 integers starting from the second element of a) is sorted in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first element of a is not greater than the second element of a, then no action is taken.***
