Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
    if check_all:
        print('YES')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                new = a[i:]
                check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))]
                    )
                new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len
                    (new))])
                if check_all_new and new_all:
                    print('YES')
                    break
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, and check_all is a boolean value. If check_all is True, the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order and 'YES' is printed. If check_all is False, i is set to n.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, and check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order. If check_all is True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, i is set to n.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value. If check_all is True, 'YES' is printed. If check_all is False, then for each i in the range [1, n), if a[i - 1] is greater than a[i], either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed and the loop has been exited. Otherwise, the loop has completed all iterations without printing anything, and i is set to n - 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
