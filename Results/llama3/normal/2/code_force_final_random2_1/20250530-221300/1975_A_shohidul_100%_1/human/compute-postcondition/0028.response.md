Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is false, `i` is 2, `new` is a list of integers, `check_all_new` is a boolean, `new_all` is a boolean. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both true, 'YES' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited.**
