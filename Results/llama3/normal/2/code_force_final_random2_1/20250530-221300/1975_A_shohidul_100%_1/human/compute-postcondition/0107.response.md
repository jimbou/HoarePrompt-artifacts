Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 2. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if check_all_new and new_all are both true, otherwise 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
