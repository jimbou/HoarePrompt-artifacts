Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is a boolean value, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both true. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then nothing is printed and the most internal loop or if statement continues.***
