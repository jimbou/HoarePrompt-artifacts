Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, and check_all is false
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers, check_all is false, i is 1. If the first element of a is greater than the second element of a, then 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the list new (which is a list of n-1 integers starting from the second element of a) is sorted in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first element of a is not greater than the second element of a, then no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is false, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then 'YES' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited if `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both true. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is false, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both true. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
