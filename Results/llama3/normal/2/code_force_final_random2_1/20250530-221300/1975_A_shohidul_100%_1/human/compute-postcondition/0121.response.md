Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It checks if the list is non-decreasing, and if not, it checks if the list can be made non-decreasing by removing a prefix of elements. The function prints 'YES' if the list is non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing, and 'NO' otherwise.**
