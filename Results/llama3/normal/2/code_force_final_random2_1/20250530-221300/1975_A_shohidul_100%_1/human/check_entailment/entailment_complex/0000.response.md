Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given array can be made non-decreasing by swapping its prefix and suffix. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first checks if the input array is already non-decreasing. If it is, the program prints 'YES' and moves on to the next test case.

2. If the array is not non-decreasing, the program iterates over the array to find the first pair of adjacent elements that are in decreasing order. 

3. Once it finds such a pair, it checks if the rest of the array (from the second element of the pair to the end) is non-decreasing and if the first element of the pair is greater than or equal to all elements in the rest of the array. 

4. If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES' and moves on to the next test case. If not, it prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
