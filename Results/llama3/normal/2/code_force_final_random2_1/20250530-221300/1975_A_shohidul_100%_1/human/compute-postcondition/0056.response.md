Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 1, new is a list of n - 1 integers, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order. Either check_all_new is false or new_all is false, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables t, n, a, check_all, i, new, check_all_new, and new_all remain the same, and the condition that either check_all_new is false or new_all is false still holds.
