Output: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 1, new is a list of n - 1 integers, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order. Either check_all_new is false or new_all is false, and 'NO' is printed**
