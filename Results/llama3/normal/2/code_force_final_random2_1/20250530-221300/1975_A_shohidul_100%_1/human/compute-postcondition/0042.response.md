The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, t must be decreased by 1.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, and check_all is a boolean value.**
