Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer and is at least 3, a is a list of n integers, check_all is false, i is 3, new is a list of n-3 integers, check_all_new is a boolean, new_all is a boolean, 'YES' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside, but does not change the values of any variables. The output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
