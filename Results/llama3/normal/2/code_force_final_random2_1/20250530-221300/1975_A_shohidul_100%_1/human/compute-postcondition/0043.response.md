Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, and check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order.**

In this output state, the value of t remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of n is updated to the integer value obtained from the input. The list a is updated to contain n integers obtained from the input. The boolean value check_all is calculated based on the updated list a, indicating whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
