Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, check_all is false, i is n.**

The loop will execute until `i` is no longer less than `n`, which means `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes executing. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `check_all` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
