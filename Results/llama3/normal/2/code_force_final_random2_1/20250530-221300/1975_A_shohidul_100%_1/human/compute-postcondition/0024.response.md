Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is false, `i` is 2, `new` is a list of integers, `check_all_new` is a boolean, `new_all` is a boolean, 'YES' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
