Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 1, new is a list of n - 1 integers, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order, check_all_new and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables t, n, a, check_all, i, new, check_all_new, and new_all remain unchanged. The list new is still sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to a[0]. The program has printed 'YES' and has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
