Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 3. If the third element of `a` is less than or equal to the fourth element of `a`, nothing happens. If the third element of `a` is greater than the fourth element of `a`, a new list `new` is created from index 3 to the end of list `a`, and a boolean value `check_all_new` is determined indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both true, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
