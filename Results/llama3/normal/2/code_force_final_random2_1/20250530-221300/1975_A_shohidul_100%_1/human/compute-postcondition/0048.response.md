Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 1, new is a list of n - 1 integers, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order.**

The code snippet executes three lines, each affecting different variables. The first line assigns a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` to the variable `new`. Since `i` is 1, `new` becomes a list of `n - 1` integers. The second line assigns a boolean value to `check_all_new` based on whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`. The third line assigns a boolean value to `new_all` based on whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, and `i` remain unchanged.
