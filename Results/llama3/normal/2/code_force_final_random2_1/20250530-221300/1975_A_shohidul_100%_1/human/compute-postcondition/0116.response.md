Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 3, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 3, new is a list of integers, check_all_new is a boolean value, new_all is a boolean value. If check_all_new and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
