To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The states of other variables, such as `t`, `a`, `check_all`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is false, `i` is 2**
