The code snippet consists of three lines that operate on the given initial state. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

1. `new = a[i:]`: This line assigns a slice of the list `a` to the variable `new`. The slice starts from the index `i` (which is 3) to the end of the list. So, `new` becomes a list of `n-3` integers, where `n` is the length of the original list `a`.

2. `check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`: This line checks if all elements in the `new` list are less than or equal to the first element of the original list `a`. The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements in the iterable (in this case, a list of boolean values) are `True`. If at least one element is `False`, it returns `False`. The variable `check_all_new` is assigned the result of this check.

3. `new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`: This line checks if the `new` list is sorted in ascending order. It does this by comparing each element with its previous one, starting from the second element (index 1). If all elements are in ascending order, `new_all` is assigned `True`; otherwise, it's assigned `False`.

Now, let's calculate the final output state:

- `t` remains unchanged as it's not affected by the code.
- `n` remains unchanged as it's not affected by the code.
- `a` remains unchanged as it's not modified by the code.
- `check_all` remains unchanged as it's not affected by the code.
- `i` remains unchanged as it's not affected by the code.
- `new` is assigned a list of `n-3` integers, which is a slice of the original list `a` starting from index 3.
- `check_all_new` is assigned a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the `new` list are less than or equal to the first element of the original list `a`.
- `new_all` is assigned a boolean value indicating whether the `new` list is sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer and is at least 3, a is a list of n integers, check_all is false, i is 3, new is a list of n-3 integers, check_all_new is a boolean, new_all is a boolean**
