Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, and check_all is a boolean value. If check_all is True, 'YES' is printed. If check_all is False, then for each i in the range [1, n), if a[i - 1] is greater than a[i], either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed and the loop has been exited. Otherwise, the loop has completed all iterations without printing anything, and i is set to n - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- If the initial value of `t` is 0, the loop does not execute at all, and the state remains unchanged.
- If the initial value of `t` is greater than 0, the loop executes `t` times.
- In each iteration, if the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `check_all` is True, and 'YES' is printed.
- If the list `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `check_all` is False. In this case, the loop checks each pair of adjacent elements in the list. If it finds a pair where the first element is greater than the second, it checks if the first element of the list is greater than or equal to all elements in the sublist starting from the second element of the pair. If this condition is true and the sublist is sorted in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
- If the loop completes all iterations without printing anything, `i` is set to `n - 1`.
