Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is a boolean value, `i` is 1, `new` is a list of `n - 1` integers, `check_all_new` is a boolean value, `new_all` is a boolean value, Either `check_all_new` is false or `new_all` is false, and 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The program execution is interrupted, and the control flow is transferred to the next statement outside the loop or if statement. The variables retain their previous values, and the condition 'NO' is being printed remains true.
