Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer and is at least 3, a is a list of n integers, check_all is false, i is 3, new is a list of n-3 integers, check_all_new is a boolean, new_all is a boolean, 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables t, n, a, check_all, i, new, check_all_new, and new_all remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The 'NO' is still being printed.
