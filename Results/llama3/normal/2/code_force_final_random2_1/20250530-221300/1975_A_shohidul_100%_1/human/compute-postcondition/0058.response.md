Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 1. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then either check_all_new is false or new_all is false, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if both check_all_new and new_all are true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
