Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is n - 1. If a[i - 1] is greater than a[i] for any i in the range [1, n), then either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed and the loop has been exited. Otherwise, the loop has completed all iterations without printing anything.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`, and the loop will have either printed 'YES' or 'NO' and exited if it found a pair of adjacent elements in the list `a` where the first element is greater than the second, or it will have completed all iterations without printing anything if no such pair was found. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `check_all` remain unchanged.
