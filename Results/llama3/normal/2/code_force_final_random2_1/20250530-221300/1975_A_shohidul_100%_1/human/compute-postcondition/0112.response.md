Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is a boolean value, `i` is 3, `new` is a list of integers, `check_all_new` is a boolean value, `new_all` is a boolean value, 'YES' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The 'YES' is still being printed as it was in the initial state.
