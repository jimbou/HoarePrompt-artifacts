Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer and is at least 2, a is a list of n integers, check_all is false, i is 1, new is a list of n-1 integers starting from the second element of a, check_all_new is a boolean value indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order, new_all is a boolean value indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order. If check_all_new is true and new_all is true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
