Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is a boolean value, `i` is 2, `new` is a list of `n - 2` integers, `check_all_new` is a boolean value, `new_all` is a boolean value, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` retain their initial values, and 'YES' remains printed.
