Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer and is at least 3, a is a list of n integers, check_all is false, i is 3, new is a list of n-3 integers, check_all_new is a boolean, new_all is a boolean. If check_all_new and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
