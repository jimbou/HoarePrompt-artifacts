Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 1. If a[i - 1] > a[i], either 'YES' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration.***
