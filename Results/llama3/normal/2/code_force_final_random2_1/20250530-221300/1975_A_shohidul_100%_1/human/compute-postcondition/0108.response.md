To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. This means that the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. To allow the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is greater than 2, it must also be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

The other variables (`t`, `a`, `check_all`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `check_all` is a boolean value, `i` is 3**
