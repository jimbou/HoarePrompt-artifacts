The code snippet is a break statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. The values of the variables do not change, but the program flow is altered.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 1, new is a list of n - 1 integers, check_all_new is a boolean value that is true, new_all is a boolean value that is true, 'YES' has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
