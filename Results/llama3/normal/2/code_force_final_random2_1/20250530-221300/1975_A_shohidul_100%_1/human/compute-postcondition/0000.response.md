The code accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers. The first input is accepted and assigned to t. The stdin now contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers. The integer n is not accepted yet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers.**
