Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of n integers, check_all is a boolean value, i is 2, new is a list of n - 2 integers, check_all_new is a boolean value, new_all is a boolean value. If check_all_new and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
