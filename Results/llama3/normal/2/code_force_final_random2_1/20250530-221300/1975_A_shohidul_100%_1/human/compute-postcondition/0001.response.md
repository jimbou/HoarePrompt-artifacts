To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is an integer, we can adjust its state to be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers.**
