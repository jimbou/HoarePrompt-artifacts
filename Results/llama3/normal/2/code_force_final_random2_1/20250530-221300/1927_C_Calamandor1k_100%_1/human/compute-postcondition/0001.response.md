To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, as well as the list `cases`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `cases` is not empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `cases` to ensure it has at least one tuple.

Additionally, since the loop iterates over the tuples in `cases`, we need to adjust the state of the first tuple to match the constraints specified in the problem statement. Specifically, we need to ensure that `n` and `m` are between 1 and 2*10^5, `k` is even and between 2 and 2*min(`n`, `m`), and the elements of `a` and `b` are between 1 and 10^6.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `k` is even and between 2 and 2*min(`n`, `m`), `a` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, `b` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, and `results` is an empty list**
