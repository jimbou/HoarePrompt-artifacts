Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, n is between 1 and 2*10^5, m is between 1 and 2*10^5, k is even and between 2 and 2*min(n, m), a is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, b is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, results is a list containing 'NO', unique_a is a set of unique integers from list a, unique_b is a set of unique integers from list b, relevant_a is a set of integers from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set of integers from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set of integers that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set of integers that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, and both is a set of integers that are in both relevant_a and relevant_b. The current value of only_a has more than half of k elements.**

The code appends 'NO' to the results list and then continues to the next iteration, without modifying any other variables. The initial state remains unchanged, except for the addition of 'NO' to the results list.
