The only objects in the loop head are variables  n, m, k, a, b and list  cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cases.  If the list has at least 2 tuples the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, cases has at least 2 tuples, n is between 1 and 2*10^5, m is between 1 and 2*10^5, k is even and between 2 and 2*min(n, m), a is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, b is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 tuples.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `k` is even and between 2 and 2*min(n, m), `a` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, `b` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, `unique_a` is a set of unique integers from list `a`, `unique_b` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set of integers from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set of integers from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set of integers that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set of integers that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set of integers that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the number of elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, and `results` is a list containing 'YES' if `total_distinct` is not less than `k`, 'NO' if `len(only_a)` > `k` // 2, and 'NO' if `len(only_b)` > `k` // 2.**
