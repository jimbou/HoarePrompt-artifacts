Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, n is between 1 and 2*10^5, m is between 1 and 2*10^5, k is even and between 2 and 2*min(n, m), a is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, b is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, unique_a is a set of unique integers from list a, unique_b is a set of unique integers from list b, relevant_a is a set of integers from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set of integers from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set of integers that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set of integers that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, both is a set of integers that are in both relevant_a and relevant_b, total_distinct is the sum of the number of elements in only_a, only_b, and both, and results is a list containing 'YES' if total_distinct is not less than k, 'NO' if len(only_a) > k // 2, and 'NO' if len(only_b) > k // 2.**

The code block updates the values of `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` based on the given conditions. The `unique_a` and `unique_b` sets are updated to contain only the unique integers from lists `a` and `b`, respectively. The `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` sets are updated to contain only the integers from `unique_a` and `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`. The `only_a` and `only_b` sets are updated to contain only the integers that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b` and vice versa. The `both` set is updated to contain only the integers that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. The `total_distinct` variable is updated to be the sum of the number of elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. The `results` list is updated to contain 'YES' if `total_distinct` is not less than `k`, 'NO' if `len(only_a)` > `k` // 2, and 'NO' if `len(only_b)` > `k` // 2.
