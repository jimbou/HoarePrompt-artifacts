Functionality: **This function determines whether it is possible to select at least k distinct elements from two lists, a and b, where k is an even number between 2 and 2 times the minimum of the lengths of a and b. It returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, where 'YES' indicates that it is possible to select at least k distinct elements and 'NO' indicates that it is not possible. The function considers the number of elements in a and b that are less than or equal to k and are unique to each list, as well as the number of elements that are common to both lists. If the total number of distinct elements is not less than k, the function returns 'YES'. If the number of elements unique to either list is greater than half of k, the function returns 'NO'.**
