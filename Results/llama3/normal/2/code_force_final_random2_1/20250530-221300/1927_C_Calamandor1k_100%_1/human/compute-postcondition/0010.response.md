Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `k` is even and between 2 and 2*min(n, m), `a` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, `b` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, `results` is a list, `unique_a` is a set of unique integers from list `a`, `unique_b` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set of integers from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set of integers from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set of integers that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set of integers that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set of integers that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, and `total_distinct` is the sum of the number of elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. The current value of `total_distinct` is less than `k`. If the number of elements in `only_a` is more than half of `k`, `results` contains 'NO'. If the number of elements in `only_b` is more than half of `k`, `results` contains 'NO'.***
