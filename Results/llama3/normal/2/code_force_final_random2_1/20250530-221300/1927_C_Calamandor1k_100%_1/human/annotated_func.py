    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is an empty list, `n` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `k` is even and between 2 and 2*min(n, m), `a` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, `b` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, `unique_a` is a set of unique integers from list `a`, `unique_b` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set of integers from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set of integers from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set of integers that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set of integers that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set of integers that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the number of elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, and `results` is a list containing 'YES' if `total_distinct` is not less than `k`, 'NO' if `len(only_a)` > `k` // 2, and 'NO' if `len(only_b)` > `k` // 2.

    #The program returns a list containing 'YES' if the total number of distinct elements in 'only_a', 'only_b', and 'both' is not less than 'k', 'NO' if the number of elements in 'only_a' is greater than half of 'k', and 'NO' if the number of elements in 'only_b' is greater than half of 'k'. Here, 'k' is an even number between 2 and 2 times the minimum of 'n' and 'm', where 'n' and 'm' are between 1 and 2*10^5. 'only_a' and 'only_b' are sets of integers that are in 'relevant_a' and 'relevant_b' respectively, but not in both, where 'relevant_a' and 'relevant_b' are sets of integers from 'unique_a' and 'unique_b' respectively, that are less than or equal to 'k'. 'unique_a' and 'unique_b' are sets of unique integers from lists 'a' and 'b' respectively, where 'a' and 'b' are lists of integers between 1 and 10^6.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether it is possible to select at least k distinct elements from two lists, a and b, where k is an even number between 2 and 2 times the minimum of the lengths of a and b. It returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, where 'YES' indicates that it is possible to select at least k distinct elements and 'NO' indicates that it is not possible. The function considers the number of elements in a and b that are less than or equal to k and are unique to each list, as well as the number of elements that are common to both lists. If the total number of distinct elements is not less than k, the function returns 'YES'. If the number of elements unique to either list is greater than half of k, the function returns 'NO'.
