Postcondition: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, n is between 1 and 2*10^5, m is between 1 and 2*10^5, k is even and between 2 and 2*min(n, m), a is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, b is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, results is an empty list, unique_a is a set of unique integers from list a, unique_b is a set of unique integers from list b, relevant_a is a set of integers from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set of integers from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set of integers that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set of integers that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, and both is a set of integers that are in both relevant_a and relevant_b. The current value of only_a has more than half of k elements.**
