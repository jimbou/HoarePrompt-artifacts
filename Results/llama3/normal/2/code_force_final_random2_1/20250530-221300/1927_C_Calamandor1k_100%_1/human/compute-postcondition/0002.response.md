Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, n is between 1 and 2*10^5, m is between 1 and 2*10^5, k is even and between 2 and 2*min(n, m), a is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, b is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, results is an empty list, unique_a is a set of unique integers from list a, unique_b is a set of unique integers from list b, relevant_a is a set of integers from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set of integers from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set of integers that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set of integers that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, and both is a set of integers that are in both relevant_a and relevant_b.**

In this output state, the initial variables `t`, `cases`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `results` retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state. The code introduces new variables `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, which are derived from the original lists `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the code. These new variables are sets that contain unique integers from `a` and `b`, filtered by the condition of being less than or equal to `k`, and further categorized into those present only in `a`, only in `b`, or in both.
