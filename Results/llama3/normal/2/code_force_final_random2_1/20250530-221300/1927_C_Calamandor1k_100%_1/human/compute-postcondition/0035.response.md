Output State: **The program returns a list containing 'YES' if the total number of distinct elements in 'only_a', 'only_b', and 'both' is not less than 'k', 'NO' if the number of elements in 'only_a' is greater than half of 'k', and 'NO' if the number of elements in 'only_b' is greater than half of 'k'. Here, 'k' is an even number between 2 and 2 times the minimum of 'n' and 'm', where 'n' and 'm' are between 1 and 2*10^5. 'only_a' and 'only_b' are sets of integers that are in 'relevant_a' and 'relevant_b' respectively, but not in both, where 'relevant_a' and 'relevant_b' are sets of integers from 'unique_a' and 'unique_b' respectively, that are less than or equal to 'k'. 'unique_a' and 'unique_b' are sets of unique integers from lists 'a' and 'b' respectively, where 'a' and 'b' are lists of integers between 1 and 10^6.**
