Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`, such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2*10^5, 2 <= `k` <= 2*min(`n`, `m`), `k` is even, and 1 <= `a_i`, `b_j` <= 10^6 for all `i` and `j`, and `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, m, k, a, b in cases:
    unique_a = set(a)
    unique_b = set(b)
    relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
    relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
    only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
    only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
    both = relevant_a & relevant_b
    if len(only_a) > k // 2:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    if len(only_b) > k // 2:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
    if total_distinct < k:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    results.append('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `k` is even and between 2 and 2*min(n, m), `a` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, `b` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, `unique_a` is a set of unique integers from list `a`, `unique_b` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set of integers from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set of integers from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set of integers that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set of integers that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set of integers that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the number of elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, and `results` is a list containing 'NO' if `total_distinct` is less than `k`, otherwise it contains 'YES'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `k` is even and between 2 and 2*min(n, m), `a` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, `b` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, `unique_a` is a set of unique integers from list `a`, `unique_b` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set of integers from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set of integers from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set of integers that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set of integers that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set of integers that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the number of elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, and `results` is a list containing 'YES' if `total_distinct` is not less than `k`, 'NO' if `len(only_a)` > `k` // 2, and 'NO' if `len(only_b)` > `k` // 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `k` is even and between 2 and 2*min(n, m), `a` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, `b` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, `unique_a` is a set of unique integers from list `a`, `unique_b` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set of integers from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set of integers from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set of integers that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set of integers that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set of integers that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the number of elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, and `results` is a list containing 'YES' if `total_distinct` is not less than `k`, 'NO' if `len(only_a)` > `k` // 2, and 'NO' if `len(only_b)` > `k` // 2. If `len(only_b)` > `k` // 2, then `results` has an additional 'NO' appended to it. If `total_distinct` is less than `k`, the program does not modify the results list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
