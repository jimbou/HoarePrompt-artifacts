Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included.

The program first creates sets of unique elements from both arrays that are less than or equal to k. It then calculates the number of elements that are unique to each array and the number of elements that are common to both arrays.

The program checks if the number of elements unique to either array is greater than half of k. If it is, the program returns 'NO' because it is not possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays.

The program also checks if the total number of distinct elements (unique to each array plus common to both arrays) is less than k. If it is, the program returns 'NO' because it is not possible to choose k distinct elements.

If neither of these conditions is met, the program returns 'YES' because it is possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included.

Correctness: **True**
