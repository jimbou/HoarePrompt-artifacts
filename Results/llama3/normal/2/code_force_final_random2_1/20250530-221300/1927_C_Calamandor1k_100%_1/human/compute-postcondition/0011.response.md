Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, n is between 1 and 2*10^5, m is between 1 and 2*10^5, k is even and between 2 and 2*min(n, m), a is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, b is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6, results is a list containing 'NO', unique_a is a set of unique integers from list a, unique_b is a set of unique integers from list b, relevant_a is a set of integers from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set of integers from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set of integers that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set of integers that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, both is a set of integers that are in both relevant_a and relevant_b, and total_distinct is the sum of the number of elements in only_a, only_b, and both.**

The code appends 'NO' to the results list and then skips to the next iteration of the loop using the continue statement. This means that the rest of the code in the loop is skipped, and the next iteration begins. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
