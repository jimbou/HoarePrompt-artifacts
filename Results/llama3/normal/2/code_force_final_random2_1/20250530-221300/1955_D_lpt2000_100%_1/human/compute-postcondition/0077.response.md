Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer equal to the length of `aa` and less than `n - 1`, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of strings that must have at least `n - m + 1` elements, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the sum of values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` and `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `nabors` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `in_aa` is the third element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the third element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then either `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 if it is greater than 0, or `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `E[in_aa]` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
