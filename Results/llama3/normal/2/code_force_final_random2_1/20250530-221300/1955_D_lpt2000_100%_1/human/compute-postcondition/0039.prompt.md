Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, aa is a list of strings, bb is a list of strings, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the sum of values in D, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, nabors is greater than 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer less than the length of `aa`, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `m + 1` elements, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the sum of values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 1 if `fnd` was 1, otherwise 0, `nabors` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer less than the length of `aa`, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `m + 2` elements, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the sum of values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 1 if `fnd` was 1, otherwise 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `nabors` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `in_aa` is the (m + 1)th element in the list, `out_aa` is the (n - m)th element in the list. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is one less than its original value, `pairs_in_D` is one less than its original value, and `C[out_aa]` is one more than its original value. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[in_aa]` is one more than its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer less than the length of `aa` and `m` is increased by 1, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `m + 2` elements, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the sum of values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 1 if `fnd` was 1, otherwise 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `nabors` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `in_aa` is the `(m + 2)`th element in the list, `out_aa` is the `(n - m - 1)`th element in the list. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
