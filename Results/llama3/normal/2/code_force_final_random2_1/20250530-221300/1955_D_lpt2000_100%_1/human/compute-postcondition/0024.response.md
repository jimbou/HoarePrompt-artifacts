Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer less than the length of `aa`, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `m + 2` elements, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the sum of values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 1 if `fnd` was 1, otherwise 0, `nabors` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `in_aa` is the (m + 1)th element in the list, `out_aa` is the (n - m)th element in the list. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is one less than its original value, `pairs_in_D` is one less than its original value, and `C[out_aa]` is one more than its original value. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.***
