Output: **n, m, k are integers, aa is a list of strings that must have at least n - m elements, bb is a list of strings, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the sum of values in D, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, in_aa is the last element of aa[m:], out_aa is the last element of aa[:n - m], nabors is greater than 0, and fnd is printed, where fnd is 1 if the sum of the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0**
