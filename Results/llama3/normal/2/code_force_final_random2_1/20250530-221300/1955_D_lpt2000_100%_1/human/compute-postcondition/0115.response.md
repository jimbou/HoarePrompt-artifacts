Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `aa` is a list of strings that must have at least `n - m + 1` elements, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the sum of values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` with `E[out_aa]` decreased by 1, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `in_aa` is the third element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the third element of `aa[:n - m]`, `nabors` is greater than 0.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial properties except for `E`, which has been updated to reflect the decrease of `E[out_aa]` by 1. This change affects the count of `out_aa` in the Counter object `E`, but does not alter the overall structure or properties of the other variables.
