Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The second line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                pairs_in_D -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            D[in_aa] += 1
            pairs_in_D += 1
            C[in_aa] -= 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer equal to the length of `aa`, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of strings, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the sum of values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `nabors` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and this is printed: 1 if the sum of values in `D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer equal to the length of aa, k is an integer, aa is a list of strings, bb is a list of strings, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the sum of values in D, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, nabors is greater than 1, stdin contains 0 inputs, in_aa is the last element of aa[m:], out_aa is the last element of aa[:n - m]. If D[out_aa] is greater than 0, then either E[out_aa] is decremented by 1 if it is greater than 0, or D[out_aa] is decremented by 1, pairs_in_D is decremented by 1, and C[out_aa] is incremented by 1. If D[out_aa] is not greater than 0, then E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. If C[in_aa] is greater than 0, then D[in_aa] is incremented by 1, pairs_in_D is incremented by 1, and C[in_aa] is decremented by 1. Otherwise, E[in_aa] is incremented by 1., and this is printed: 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n, m, k are integers, aa is a list of strings that must have at least n - m elements, bb is a list of strings, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the sum of values in D, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, in_aa is the last element of aa[m:], out_aa is the last element of aa[:n - m], nabors is greater than 0, and fnd is printed, where fnd is 1 if the sum of the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
