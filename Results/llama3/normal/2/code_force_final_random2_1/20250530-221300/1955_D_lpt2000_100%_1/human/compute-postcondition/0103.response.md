Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, aa is a list of strings that must have at least n - m elements, bb is a list of strings, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb with D[out_aa] decremented by 1, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the sum of values in D decremented by 1, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D with C[out_aa] incremented by 1, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, in_aa is the second element of aa[m:], out_aa is the second element of aa[:n - m], nabors is greater than 0.**
