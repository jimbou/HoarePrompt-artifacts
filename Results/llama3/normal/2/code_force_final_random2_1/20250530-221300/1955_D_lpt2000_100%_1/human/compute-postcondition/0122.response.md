Based on the precondition, the `print(fnd)` statement will print the value of `fnd`, which is an integer that indicates whether the number of pairs in `D` (the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`) is greater than or equal to `k`.

Since `fnd` is defined as 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 0 otherwise, the output will be either 1 or 0.

Output: **1 if the number of pairs in D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0**
