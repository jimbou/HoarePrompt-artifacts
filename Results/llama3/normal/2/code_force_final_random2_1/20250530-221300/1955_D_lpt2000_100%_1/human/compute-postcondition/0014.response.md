Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer less than the length of aa, k is an integer, aa is a list of strings with at least m + 1 elements, bb is a list of strings, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb with D[in_aa] increased by 1, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the sum of values in D increased by 1, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D with C[in_aa] decreased by 1, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, nabors is greater than 0, stdin is empty.**
