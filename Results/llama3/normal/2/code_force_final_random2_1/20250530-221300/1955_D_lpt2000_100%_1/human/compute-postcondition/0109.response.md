Postcondition: ***n, m, k are integers, aa is a list of strings that must have at least n - m elements, bb is a list of strings, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the sum of values in D, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, in_aa is the second element of aa[m:], out_aa is the second element of aa[:n - m], nabors is greater than 0. If C[in_aa] is greater than 0, then D[in_aa] is incremented by 1, pairs_in_D is incremented by 1, and C[in_aa] is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if D[out_aa] is greater than 0, then if E[out_aa] is greater than 0, E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. Otherwise, D[out_aa] is decremented by 1, pairs_in_D is decremented by 1, and C[out_aa] is incremented by 1. If D[out_aa] is not greater than 0, then E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. Additionally, E[in_aa] is incremented by 1.***
