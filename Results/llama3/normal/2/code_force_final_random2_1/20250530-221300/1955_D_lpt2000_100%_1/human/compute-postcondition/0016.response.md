Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer less than the length of `aa`, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `m + 1` elements, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the sum of values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` with `E[in_aa]` increased by 1, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `nabors` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Additionally, `C[in_aa]` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `E[in_aa]` has been increased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
