Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `aa` is a list of strings that must have at least `n - m` elements, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the sum of values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]`, `nabors` is greater than 0. The current value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0. If `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` has been decremented by 1. If `E[out_aa]` is 0, then `C[out_aa]` is greater than 0 and `pairs_in_D` is less than its original value by 1.***
