Output State: **`nabors` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The second line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6.**

In this output state, the value of `nabors` is an integer that was read from the input, which was the first line of each test case containing three integers: n, m, and k. The stdin now contains the remaining two lines of each test case: the line with n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and the line with m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m.
