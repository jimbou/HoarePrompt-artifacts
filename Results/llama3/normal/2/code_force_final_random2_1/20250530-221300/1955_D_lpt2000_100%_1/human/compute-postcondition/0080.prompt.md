Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer equal to the length of aa, k is an integer, aa is a list of strings, bb is a list of strings, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the sum of values in D, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, nabors is greater than 1, stdin contains 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of strings, and this is printed: 1 if the sum of values in D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer equal to the length of `aa`, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of strings that must have at least `n - m` elements, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the sum of values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `nabors` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of strings, `in_aa` is the first element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element of `aa[:n - m]. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is 0. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0 and `C[out_aa]` is 1. The printed value is 1 if the sum of values in `D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is greater than its original value by 1, `pairs_in_D` is greater than its original value by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is less than its original value by 1. Otherwise, `C[in_aa]` is 0 and `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer equal to the length of `aa`, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of strings that must have at least `n - m` elements, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the sum of values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` and 0 otherwise, `nabors` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `in_aa` is the second element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is one less than its original value, `pairs_in_D` is one less than its original value, and `C[out_aa]` is one more than its original value. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is one more than its original value, `pairs_in_D` is one more than its original value, and `C[in_aa]` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is one more than its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer equal to the length of `aa` and less than `n - 1`, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of strings that must have at least `n - m + 1` elements, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of strings in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the sum of values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `nabors` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `in_aa` is the third element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the third element of `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then either `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 if it is greater than 0, or `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
