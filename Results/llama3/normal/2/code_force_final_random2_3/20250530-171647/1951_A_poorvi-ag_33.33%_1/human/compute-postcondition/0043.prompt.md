Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and equals 0, i is t, n is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains no test cases, results is a list of strings 'yes' and 'no' where 'yes' is appended to results if the count of '1' in arr is even and 'no' is appended to results if the count of '1' in arr is odd or if arr contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring.
Code of the loop:
for r in results:
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and equals 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains no test cases, `results` is a list of strings 'yes' and 'no' that must have at least 1 element, `r` is the first element in the list, and the first element in the list which is 'yes' or 'no' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and equals 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains no test cases, `results` is a list of strings 'yes' and 'no' that must have at least 2 elements, `r` is the second element in the list, and the second element of the list which is 'no' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and equals 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains no test cases, `results` is a list of strings 'yes' and 'no' that must have at least 3 elements, `r` is the third element in the list, and the third element of the list which is 'yes' or 'no' is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
