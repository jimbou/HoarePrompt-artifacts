Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and equals 0, i is t, n is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains no test cases, results is a list of strings 'yes' and 'no' where 'yes' is appended to results if the count of '1' in arr is even and 'no' is appended to results if the count of '1' in arr is odd or if arr contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be equal to 0, `i` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, `n` will be an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, there will be no test cases left in `stdin`, and `results` will be a list of strings 'yes' and 'no'. 'yes' will be appended to `results` if the count of '1' in `arr` is even, and 'no' will be appended to `results` if the count of '1' in `arr` is odd or if `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring.
