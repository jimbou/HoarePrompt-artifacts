Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `arr` is a binary string of size `n` containing exactly two '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing exactly one '1' or a binary string of size `n` containing no '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing '11' as a substring. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, then `results` is a list that contains the string 'no' and 'no' is appended to the results list.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the string 'no' is appended to the results list when the conditions are met. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
