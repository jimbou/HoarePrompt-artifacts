Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The current value of arr is a binary string of size n containing exactly two '1's and has '11' as a substring. The current value of results is a list with two elements 'no' and 'no'. The current value of the count of '1' in arr is 2.**

In this output state, the value of results has been updated to include another 'no' element, while the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two, and the properties of arr and the count of '1' in arr are still the same.
