Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, n is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, arr is a binary string of size n containing exactly two '1's or a binary string of size n containing exactly one '1' or a binary string of size n containing no '1's or a binary string of size n containing '11' as a substring. If arr contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, then results is a list that contains the string 'no'. If arr contains an even number of '1's, then results is a list that contains the string 'yes', otherwise results is a list that contains the string 'no'.**

The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, and then reads a binary string from stdin and assigns it to `arr`. The value of `n` is updated to the newly read integer, and the value of `arr` is updated to the newly read binary string. The values of `t`, `i`, and `results` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three.
