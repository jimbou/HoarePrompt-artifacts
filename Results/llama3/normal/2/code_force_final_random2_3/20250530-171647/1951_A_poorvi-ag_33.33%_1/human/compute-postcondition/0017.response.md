Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `arr` is a binary string of size `n` containing exactly two '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing exactly one '1' or a binary string of size `n` containing no '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing '11' as a substring, `results` is a list that contains the string 'no'**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the `results` list now contains the string 'no'. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
