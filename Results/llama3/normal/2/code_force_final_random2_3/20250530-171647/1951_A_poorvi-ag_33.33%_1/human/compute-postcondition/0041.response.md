Based on the precondition, the variable `r` is the third element in the list `results`. The list `results` contains strings 'yes' and 'no' and must have at least 3 elements.

Since `r` is the third element in the list, it can be either 'yes' or 'no'. However, the exact value of `r` cannot be determined without knowing the specific elements in the list `results`.

Therefore, the output will be either 'yes' or 'no', depending on the value of the third element in the list `results`.

Output: **yes or no (where yes or no is the third element in the list results)**
