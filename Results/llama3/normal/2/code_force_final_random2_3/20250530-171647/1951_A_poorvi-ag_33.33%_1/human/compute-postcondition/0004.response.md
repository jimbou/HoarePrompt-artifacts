Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is a list with one element 'no', `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `arr` is a binary string of size `n` containing exactly two '1's and has '11' as a substring, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial conditions except for the `results` list, which now contains the string 'no' as its first element. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
