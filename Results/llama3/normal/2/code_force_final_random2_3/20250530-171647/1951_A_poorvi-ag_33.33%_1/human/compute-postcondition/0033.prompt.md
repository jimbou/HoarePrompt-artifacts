Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains one line. The line contains a binary string s of size n (1 <= n <= 50)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
        results.append('no')
    if arr.count('1') % 2 == 0:
        if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        else:
            results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the count of '1' in arr is even, arr is a binary string of size n containing exactly two '1's. If arr has '11' as a substring, results is a list with two elements 'no' and 'no'. Otherwise, results is a list with two elements 'no' and 'yes' or is a list with one element 'yes'. If the count of '1' in arr is odd, results is a list with two elements 'no'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `arr` is a binary string of size `n` containing exactly two '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing exactly one '1' or a binary string of size `n` containing no '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing '11' as a substring. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, then `results` is a list that contains the string 'no'. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's, then `results` is a list that contains the string 'yes', otherwise `results` is a list that contains the string 'no'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `arr` is a binary string of size `n` containing exactly two '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing exactly one '1' or a binary string of size `n` containing no '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing '11' as a substring. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's, then `results` is a list that contains the string 'yes', otherwise `results` is a list that contains the string 'no'. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, then 'no' has been appended to results, otherwise 'yes' has been appended to results. If `arr` contains an odd number of '1's, then 'no' has been appended to results.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
