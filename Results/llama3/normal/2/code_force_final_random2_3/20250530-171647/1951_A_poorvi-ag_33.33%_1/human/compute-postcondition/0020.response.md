Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `arr` is a binary string of size `n` containing exactly two '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing exactly one '1' or a binary string of size `n` containing no '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing '11' as a substring. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, then `results` is a list that contains the string 'no' and 'yes'.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include the string 'yes', while the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring still holds, and the list `results` now contains both 'no' and 'yes'.
