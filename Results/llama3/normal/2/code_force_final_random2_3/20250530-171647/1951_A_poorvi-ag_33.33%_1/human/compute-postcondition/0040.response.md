To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for r in results:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `r` and `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 elements, `r` is the second element in the list, which is `'no'`, and it is being printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least 3 elements, and `r` must be the third element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and equals 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains no test cases, `results` is a list of strings 'yes' and 'no' that must have at least 3 elements, `r` is the third element in the list**
