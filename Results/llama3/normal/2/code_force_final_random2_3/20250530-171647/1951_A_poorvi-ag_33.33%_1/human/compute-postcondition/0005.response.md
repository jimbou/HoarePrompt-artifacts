Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If arr is a binary string of size n containing exactly two '1's and has '11' as a substring, results is a list with one element 'no'. Otherwise, results is an empty list.***
