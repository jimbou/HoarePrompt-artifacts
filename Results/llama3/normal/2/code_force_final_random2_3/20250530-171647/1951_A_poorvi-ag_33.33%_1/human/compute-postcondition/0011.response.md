Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. arr is a binary string of size n containing exactly two '1's. If arr has '11' as a substring, results is a list with two elements 'no' and 'no'. Otherwise, results is a list with two elements 'no' and 'yes' or is a list with one element 'yes'. The count of '1' in arr is 2.**
