#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000). The second line contains a binary string s of size n (1 <= n <= 50).
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        
        if arr.count('1') % 2 == 0:
            if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
                results.append('no')
            else:
                results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and equals 0, i is t, n is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains no test cases, results is a list of strings 'yes' and 'no' where 'yes' is appended to results if the count of '1' in arr is even and 'no' is appended to results if the count of '1' in arr is odd or if arr contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring.
    for r in results:
        print(r)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and equals 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains no test cases, `results` is a list of strings 'yes' and 'no' that must have at least 1 element, `r` is the last element in the list, and the last element of the list which is 'yes' or 'no' has been printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string. It then checks each binary string to determine if the count of '1's is even or if the string contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring. Based on these conditions, it appends either 'yes' or 'no' to a results list. Finally, it prints each result from the list. The function effectively categorizes binary strings based on the parity of '1's and the presence of consecutive '1's, providing a 'yes' or 'no' classification for each string.
