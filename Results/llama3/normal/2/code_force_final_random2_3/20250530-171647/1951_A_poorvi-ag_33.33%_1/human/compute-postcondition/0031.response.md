Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `arr` is a binary string of size `n` containing exactly two '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing exactly one '1' or a binary string of size `n` containing no '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing '11' as a substring. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, then `results` is a list that contains the string 'no'. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's, then `results` is a list that contains the string 'yes', otherwise `results` is a list that contains the string 'no'. The list `results` now contains an additional string 'no'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain the same as before. The list `results` now contains an additional string 'no', and its previous conditions still apply.
