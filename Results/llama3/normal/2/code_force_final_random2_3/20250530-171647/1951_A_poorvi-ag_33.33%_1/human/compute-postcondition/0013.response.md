Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, results is a list with two elements 'no', The number of '1's in arr is odd.**

In this output state, the value of `t`, `i`, `n` and the number of '1's in arr remains the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The only change is in the results list, which now contains two elements 'no' instead of one.
