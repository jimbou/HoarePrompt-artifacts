The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `results` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains one line. The line contains a binary string `s` of size `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains one line. The line contains a binary string `s` of size `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50)**
