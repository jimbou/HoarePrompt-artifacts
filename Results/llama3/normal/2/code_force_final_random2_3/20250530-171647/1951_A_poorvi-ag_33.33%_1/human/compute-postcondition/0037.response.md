According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 1 element, `r` is the first element in the list, and the first element in the list which is 'yes' or 'no' is being printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `r` is the second element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and equals 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains no test cases, `results` is a list of strings 'yes' and 'no' that must have at least 2 elements, `r` is the second element in the list**
