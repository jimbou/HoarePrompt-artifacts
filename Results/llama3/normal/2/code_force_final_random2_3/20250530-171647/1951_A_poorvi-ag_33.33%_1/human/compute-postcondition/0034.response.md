To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `r` and the list `results`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. 

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and equals 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains no test cases, and `results` is a list of strings 'yes' and 'no' where 'yes' is appended to `results` if the count of '1' in `arr` is even and 'no' is appended to `results` if the count of '1' in `arr` is odd or if `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring.

For the loop to execute, `results` must have at least 1 element, and `r` is the first element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and equals 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains no test cases, `results` is a list of strings 'yes' and 'no' that must have at least 1 element, `r` is the first element in the list**
