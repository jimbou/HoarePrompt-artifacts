You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.The user gives the number as input.
Program:
```
def is_prime():

```

Precondition: **stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 1).**

# Example 4

Problem description:Write a Python program that reads a list of integers and a number n from the user, then finds the n largest integers using the heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
def func_1():

```

Precondition: **stdin contains two inputs: first a  space-separated list of integers and then an integer . The integer is a non-negative integer and less or equal than the lengtth of the list.**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: There are 𝑛 lamps numbered 1 to 𝑛 lined up in a row, initially turned off. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose two non-adjacent† lamps that are currently turned off, then turn them on. Determine whether you can reach configuration 𝑠, where 𝑠𝑖=1 means the 𝑖-th lamp is turned on, and 𝑠𝑖=0 otherwise. † Only lamp 𝑖 and 𝑖+1 are adjacent for all 1≤𝑖<𝑛. Note that lamp 𝑛 and 1 are not adjacent when 𝑛≠2. Input: Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤50) — the number of lamps. The second line of each test case contains a binary string 𝑠 of size 𝑛 — the final desired configuration. Output: For each test case, print on one line "YES" if we can reach the configuration 𝑠 via applying the given operation any number of times. Otherwise, print "NO".
