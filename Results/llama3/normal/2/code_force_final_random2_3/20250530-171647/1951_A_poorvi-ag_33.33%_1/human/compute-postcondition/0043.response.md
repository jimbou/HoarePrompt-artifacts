Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and equals 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `stdin` contains no test cases, `results` is a list of strings 'yes' and 'no' that must have at least 1 element, `r` is the last element in the list, and the last element of the list which is 'yes' or 'no' has been printed**

The loop will execute until all elements in the `results` list have been printed. After the loop finishes executing, the state of the variables will remain the same as before, except for the loop variable `r`, which will be the last element in the `results` list. The last element of the list, which is either 'yes' or 'no', will have been printed.
