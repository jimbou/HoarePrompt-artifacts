The code snippet reads the number of test cases minus one from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Then, it reads a binary string `s` of size `n` from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `arr`. 

Since `n` is assigned the value of the input, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `n` becomes an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0. The variable `arr` is assigned a binary string of size `n`, which means it can have a length between 1 and 50.

The variables `t`, `i`, and `results` are not modified by the code snippet, so they retain their initial values. `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `i` remains 0, and `results` remains an empty list.

Stdin initially contains multiple test cases minus one. After the code executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, i is 0, results is an empty list, n is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, arr is a binary string of size n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**
