Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `arr` is a binary string of size `n` containing exactly two '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing exactly one '1' or a binary string of size `n` containing no '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing '11' as a substring. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, then `results` is a list that contains the string 'no' and 'yes', otherwise if `arr` contains an even number of '1's, then `results` is a list that contains the string 'yes' and 'yes', otherwise `results` is a list that contains the string 'no' and 'yes'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remains the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the `results` list, which now contains an additional string 'yes'. The condition for `results` is also updated to reflect the new value. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, then `results` contains 'no' and 'yes'. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's, then `results` contains 'yes' and 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'no' and 'yes'.
