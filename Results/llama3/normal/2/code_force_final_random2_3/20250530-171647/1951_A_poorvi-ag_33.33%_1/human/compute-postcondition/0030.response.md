Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 3 and 1000 and greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `arr` is a binary string of size `n` containing exactly two '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing exactly one '1' or a binary string of size `n` containing no '1's or a binary string of size `n` containing '11' as a substring. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, then `results` is a list that contains the string 'no'. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's, then `results` is a list that contains the string 'yes', otherwise `results` is a list that contains the string 'no'. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, then 'no' has been appended to results, otherwise 'yes' has been appended to results.***
