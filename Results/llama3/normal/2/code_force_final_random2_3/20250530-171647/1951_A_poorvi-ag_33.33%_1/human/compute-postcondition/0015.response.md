The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the count of '1' in arr is even, arr is a binary string of size n containing exactly two '1's. If arr has '11' as a substring, results is a list with two elements 'no' and 'no'. Otherwise, results is a list with two elements 'no' and 'yes' or is a list with one element 'yes'. If the count of '1' in arr is odd, results is a list with two elements 'no'.**
