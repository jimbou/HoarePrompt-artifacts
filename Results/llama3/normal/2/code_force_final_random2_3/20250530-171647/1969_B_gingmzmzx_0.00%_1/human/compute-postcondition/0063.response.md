Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `c` is the third integer in the list `s`, `zeroes` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s` and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` plus two if `c` is 1 plus one, `ans` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` times the number of zeroes in the list `s` plus one if the number of ones in the list `s` plus two if `c` is 1 is greater than 0 and `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` times the number of zeroes in the list `s` plus the difference between the number of zeroes in the list `s` and the number of zeroes in the list `s` plus 1 if `c` is 1 plus 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, stdin contains `n-5` lines, each containing a binary string.***
