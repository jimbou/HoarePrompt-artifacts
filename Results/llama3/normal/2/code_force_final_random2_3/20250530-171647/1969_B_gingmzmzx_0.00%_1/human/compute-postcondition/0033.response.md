Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is 1 and `cnt[1]` is 1 if `c` is not 0, otherwise `cnt[1]` is 0, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines, each containing a binary string, `c` is the second element of the list `s`. If `c` is 0, then `ans` is 0. If `c` is not 0, then `ans` is `zeroes - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[1]` has been updated based on the value of `c`. If `c` is not 0, then `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, making it 1. Otherwise, `cnt[1]` remains 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
