Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers representing a binary string that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `cnt[0]` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes+1` and `cnt[1]` is either 0 or 1, If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or not. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`. `stdin` contains `n-1` lines, each containing a binary string.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt[c]` has been increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The value of `cnt[0]` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes+1` and the value of `cnt[1]` is either 0 or 1. The value of `ans` depends on the value of `c`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or not. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.
