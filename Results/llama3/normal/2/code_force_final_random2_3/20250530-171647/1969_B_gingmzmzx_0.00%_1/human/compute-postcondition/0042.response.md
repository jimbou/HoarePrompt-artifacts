Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is an empty list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s` and `cnt[1]` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s`, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines, each containing a binary string, `ans` is equal to the number of ones in the list `s` times the number of zeroes in the list `s`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `s` is empty, the count of zeroes and ones in `cnt` is equal to the number of zeroes and ones in the list `s` respectively, and the answer `ans` is equal to the product of the number of ones and zeroes in the list `s`. The other variables `_`, `n`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
