Precondition: **stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a binary string (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s) for each test case. The length of the binary string is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). The sum of lengths of strings over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5.**
