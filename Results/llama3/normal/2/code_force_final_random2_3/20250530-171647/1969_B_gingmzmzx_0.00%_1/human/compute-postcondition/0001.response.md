The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and _ is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0,  stdin contains n lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5), _ is 0**
