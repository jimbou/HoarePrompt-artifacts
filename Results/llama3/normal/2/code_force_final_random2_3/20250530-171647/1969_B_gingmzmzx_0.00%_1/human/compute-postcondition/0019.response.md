Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `s` is a list of integers representing a binary string that must have at least 3 integers, `c` is the third integer in the list, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, `cnt[0]` is either `zeroes` or `zeroes+1` and `cnt[1]` is either 0 or 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or not. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0] + 2`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is either `zeroes+1` or `zeroes+2` depending on whether `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 or not. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `2*zeroes - cnt[0] + 1`. `stdin` contains `n-1` lines, each containing a binary string.**
