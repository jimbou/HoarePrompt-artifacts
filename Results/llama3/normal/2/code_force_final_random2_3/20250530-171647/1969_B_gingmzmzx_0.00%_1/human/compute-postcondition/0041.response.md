Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `zeroes` is an integer equal to the number of zeroes in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list containing two integers where `cnt[0]` is 1 and `cnt[1]` is 2 if `c` is not 0, otherwise `cnt[1]` is 1, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines, each containing a binary string, `c` is the third element of the list `s`. If `c` is 0, then `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - 1`. If `c` is not 0, then `ans` is `zeroes` if `cnt[1]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - 1` if `cnt[1]` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `2 * zeroes - 3`***
