Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input "101". The program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1. The program is counting the number of 1's and 0's separately and then calculating the cost based on the counts, but this approach is not correct. The correct approach is to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to sort the string.

In the case of "101", we can perform a single cyclic shift to get "110", which is sorted. Therefore, the correct output should be 1, not 2.
