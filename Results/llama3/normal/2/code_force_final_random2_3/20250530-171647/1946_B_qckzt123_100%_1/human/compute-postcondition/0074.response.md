Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-5 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 1, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, x is the third integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, tmp is 0, t is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of a plus the third integer in the list plus the third integer in the list plus the third integer in the list and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * (2^(k-1) * t % MOD) % MOD + 2 * (t % MOD) + 2 * (t % MOD) + ... + 2 * (2^(k-1) * t % MOD) % MOD, i is k-2. If the maximum subarray sum of a plus the third integer in the list plus the third integer in the list plus the third integer in the list is less than 0, then the maximum subarray sum of a plus the third integer in the list plus the third integer in the list plus the third integer in the list is 0 and t is the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x. Otherwise, the maximum subarray sum of a plus the third integer in the list plus the third integer in the list plus the third integer in the list is not changed and t is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of a plus the third integer in the list plus the third integer in the list plus the third integer in the list and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `tmp` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
