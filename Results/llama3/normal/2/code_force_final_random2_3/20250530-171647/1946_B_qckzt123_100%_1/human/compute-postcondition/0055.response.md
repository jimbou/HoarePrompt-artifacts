Output State: **T is an integer greater than 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 3, a is a list of n integers, x is the last integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 1, tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a, t is the maximum of tmp and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * (2^(k-1) * t % MOD) % MOD + 2 * (t % MOD) + 2 * (t % MOD), i is 2**

The code snippet modifies the values of `t` and `ans`. The first line doubles the value of `t`, and the second line takes the modulus of `t` with `MOD`, ensuring that `t` remains within a certain range. The third line adds the new value of `t` to `ans`, and the fourth line takes the modulus of `ans` with `MOD`, ensuring that `ans` also remains within a certain range. The other variables remain unchanged.
