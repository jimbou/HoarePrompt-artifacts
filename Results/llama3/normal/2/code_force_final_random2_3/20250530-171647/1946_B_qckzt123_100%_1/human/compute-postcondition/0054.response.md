The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be at least 3.
State: **T is an integer greater than 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 3, a is a list of n integers, x is the last integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 1, tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a, t is the maximum of tmp and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * (2^(k-1) * t % MOD) % MOD + 2 * (t % MOD), i is 2**
