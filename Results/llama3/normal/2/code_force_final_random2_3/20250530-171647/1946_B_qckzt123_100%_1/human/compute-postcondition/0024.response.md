Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 3, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, x is the last integer in the list, tmp is 0, t is the maximum of tmp and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and tmp, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * t % MOD, i is 1, t is 2 * t % MOD**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been doubled and then taken modulo `MOD`, and this new value of `t` has been added to `ans`, which has also been taken modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
