Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 1, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, x is the last integer in the list, tmp is 0, t is the maximum of tmp and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and tmp, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2^(k-1) * t % MOD, i is k-1, t is 2^(k-1) * t % MOD**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables i, t, and ans. The variable i is now equal to k-1, indicating that the loop has executed k-1 times. The variable t is now equal to 2^(k-1) * t % MOD, which is the result of multiplying t by 2 and taking the modulus MOD k-1 times. The variable ans is now equal to ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2^(k-1) * t % MOD, which is the result of adding 2^(k-1) * t % MOD to the initial value of ans.
