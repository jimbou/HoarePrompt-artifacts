Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 1, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, x is the first integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, tmp is 0, t is the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * (2^(k-1) * t % MOD) % MOD + 2 * (t % MOD) + 2 * (t % MOD) + ... + 2 * (2^(k-1) * t % MOD) % MOD, i is k-2.**

The code sets the value of `tmp` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`, because `tmp` was not used in the calculation of `t`. The value of `ans` is still the same, because it does not depend on `tmp`.
