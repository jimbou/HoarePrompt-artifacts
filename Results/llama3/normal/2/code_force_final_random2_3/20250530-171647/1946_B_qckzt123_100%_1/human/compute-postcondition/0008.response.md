Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of 0 and tmp, _ is 0, x is the first integer in the list, and tmp is 0 if the first integer in the list is negative, otherwise tmp remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and tmp. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of tmp is 0 if the first integer in the list is negative, otherwise it remains unchanged.
