To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for x in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `x` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least one more integer, the loop executes again.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, and `x` is the first integer in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least one more integer, and `x` must be the next integer in the list.

State: **`T` is an integer greater than 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `stdin` contains `T-4` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `k` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is 1, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of `x` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`, `ans` is ((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD` + 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, `i` is `k-1`, the current value of `t` is 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, and the current value of `ans` is printed, if `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0.**
