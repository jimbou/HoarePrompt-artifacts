Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is 0, tmp is 0, _ is 0**

The code reads two lines from stdin for a test case, assigning the values to `n` and `k`, and the list of integers to `a`. It then calculates the sum of the integers in `a` and assigns it to `s`. The variables `t` and `tmp` are initialized to 0. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
