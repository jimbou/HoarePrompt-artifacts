Output State: **T is an integer greater than 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 2, a is a list of n integers, x is the last integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 1, tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a, t is the maximum of tmp and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * (2^(k-1) * t % MOD) % MOD, i is 0.**

The code multiplies `t` by 2, takes the modulus of the result with `MOD`, adds the result to `ans`, and then takes the modulus of `ans` with `MOD`. The value of `t` is initially 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`. After the first line, `t` becomes 2 * 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`. The second line takes the modulus of this value with `MOD`, so `t` becomes (2 * 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`) % `MOD`. The third line adds this value to `ans`, making `ans` equal to ((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD` + (2 * 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`) % `MOD`. The fourth line takes the modulus of `ans` with `MOD`, so `ans` becomes (((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD` + (2 * 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`) % `MOD`) % `MOD`. No other variables are affected.
