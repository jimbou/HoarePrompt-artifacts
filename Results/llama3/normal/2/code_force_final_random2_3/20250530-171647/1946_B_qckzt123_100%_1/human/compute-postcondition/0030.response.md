State: **`T` is an integer greater than 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `stdin` contains `T-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `k` is an integer at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is 1, `x` is the last integer in the list, `tmp` is 0, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `tmp`, `ans` is ((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD` + 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, `i` is `k-1`, `t` is 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, and `ans` is printed**
