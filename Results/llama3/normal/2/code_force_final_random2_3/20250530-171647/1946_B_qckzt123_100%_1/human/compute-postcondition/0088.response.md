Output State: **T is an integer greater than or equal to 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 1, a is a list of n integers, x is the last integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is T-1, tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a, t is the maximum of tmp and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x, ans is (((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 * t) % MOD + t) % MOD + ... + (2^(k-1) * t) % MOD, i is k-1, and ans is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The number of test cases, T, is greater than or equal to 0.
* The modulus, MOD, remains 1000000007.
* There are no more test cases left in the standard input, stdin.
* The variables n, k, a, x, s, _, tmp, t, ans, and i have the same values as after the third iteration of the loop.
* The value of ans is printed, which is the result of the formula (((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 * t) % MOD + t) % MOD + ... + (2^(k-1) * t) % MOD.
