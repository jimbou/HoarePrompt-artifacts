Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `stdin` contains `T-4` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `k` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is 1, `tmp` is 0, `t` is the maximum of `x` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`, `ans` is ((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD` + 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, `i` is `k-1`, the current value of `t` is 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, and the current value of `ans` is printed.**

The code only changes the value of `tmp` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `tmp` is now 0, and the rest of the variables maintain their previous values and conditions.
