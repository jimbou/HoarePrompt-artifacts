To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `x` and the list `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `x` is the last integer in the list.

For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least 1 integer, and `x` must be the first integer in the list.

State: **`T` is an integer greater than 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `stdin` contains `T-4` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `k` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is 1, `tmp` is 0, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `tmp`, `ans` is ((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD` + 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, `i` is `k-1`, `t` is 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, and `ans` is printed**
