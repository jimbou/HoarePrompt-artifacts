Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, x is the last integer in the list, t is the maximum of tmp and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and tmp. If tmp is less than 0, tmp is reset to 0. Otherwise, tmp is increased by the last integer in the list.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` is empty, and the variable `x` is the last integer in the list. The variable `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `tmp`. If `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` is increased by the last integer in the list. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
