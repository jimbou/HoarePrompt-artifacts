Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, x is the last integer in the list, t is the maximum of tmp and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and tmp. If tmp is less than 0, tmp is reset to 0. Otherwise, tmp is increased by the last integer in the list, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD**

The value of `ans` is calculated by adding `s` and `t`, taking the modulus of the result with `MOD`, adding `MOD` to the result, and then taking the modulus again with `MOD`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state includes the new value of `ans` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
