The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is an integer equal to the number of test cases, `MOD` is 1000000007, stdin contains `T-1` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 2 × 10^5). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, …, `a_n` (-10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  `T` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `MOD` is 1000000007, stdin contains `T-1` test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 2 × 10^5). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, …, `a_n` (-10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9), `_` is 0**
