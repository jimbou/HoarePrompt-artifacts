Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 1, a is a list of n integers that must have at least n integers, x is the nth integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list, t is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * (2^(k-1) * t % MOD) % MOD + 2 * (t % MOD) + 2 * (t % MOD) + ... + 2 * (2^(k-1) * t % MOD) % MOD, i is k-2. If the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list is less than 0, then the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list is 0 and t is the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x. Otherwise, the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list is not changed and t is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all the elements in the list `a`, and the variables `x`, `tmp`, and `t` have been updated accordingly. The variable `x` now holds the value of the last integer in the list, `tmp` holds the maximum subarray sum of the list plus the last integer in the list, and `t` holds the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of `x` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
