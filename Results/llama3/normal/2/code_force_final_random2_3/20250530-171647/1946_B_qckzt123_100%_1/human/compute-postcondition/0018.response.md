Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `MOD` is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is 0, `x` is the third integer in the list, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the third integer in the list and its previous value and `tmp`. If `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` is increased by the third integer in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `t` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `tmp`. The other variables remain unchanged.
