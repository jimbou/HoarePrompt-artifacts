Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of 0 and tmp, _ is 0, x is the second integer in the list, and tmp is the sum of the second integer in the list and its previous value which is 0 if the second integer in the list is negative, otherwise tmp remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the value of tmp. The value of tmp is now the sum of the second integer in the list and its previous value. If the second integer in the list is negative, tmp remains 0, otherwise tmp is the sum of the second integer in the list and its previous value.
