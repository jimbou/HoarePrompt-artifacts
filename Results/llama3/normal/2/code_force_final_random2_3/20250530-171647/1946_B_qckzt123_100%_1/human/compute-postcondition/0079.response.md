State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `MOD` is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `k` is an integer at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least `n` integers, `x` is the nth integer in the list, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is 0, `tmp` is the maximum subarray sum of `a` plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list, `t` is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of `a` plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list and the maximum of `x` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`, `ans` is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, `i` is 0**
