Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `MOD` is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `k` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least `n` integers, `x` is the nth integer in the list, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is 0, `tmp` is the maximum subarray sum of `a` plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list, `t` is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of `a` plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list and the maximum of `x` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`, `ans` is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, `i` is k-2. If the maximum subarray sum of `a` plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list is less than 0, then the maximum subarray sum of `a` plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list is 0 and `t` is the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`. Otherwise, the maximum subarray sum of `a` plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list is not changed and `t` is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of `a` plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list and the maximum of `x` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the result of the expression `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.
