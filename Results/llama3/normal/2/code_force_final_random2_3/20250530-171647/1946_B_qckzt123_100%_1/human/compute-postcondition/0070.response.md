Postcondition: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 1, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, x is the second integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a plus the second integer in the list plus the second integer in the list, t is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of a plus the second integer in the list plus the second integer in the list and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * (2^(k-1) * t % MOD) % MOD + 2 * (t % MOD) + 2 * (t % MOD) + ... + 2 * (2^(k-1) * t % MOD) % MOD, i is k-2. If the maximum subarray sum of a plus the second integer in the list plus the second integer in the list is less than 0, then the maximum subarray sum of a plus the second integer in the list plus the second integer in the list is 0 and t is the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x. Otherwise, the maximum subarray sum of a plus the second integer in the list plus the second integer in the list is not changed and t is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of a plus the second integer in the list plus the second integer in the list and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x.**
