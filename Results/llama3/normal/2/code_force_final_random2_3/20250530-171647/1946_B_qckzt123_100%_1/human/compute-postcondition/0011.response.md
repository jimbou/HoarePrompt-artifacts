Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of 0 and tmp, _ is 0, x is the second integer in the list, and tmp is 0.**

The code assigns the value 0 to the variable tmp. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains T-2 test cases. The list a still has at least 2 integers, and the sum of its integers is still s. The value of t is still the maximum of 0 and tmp, which is now 0. The value of x is still the second integer in the list.
