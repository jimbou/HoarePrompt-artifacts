This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the integers, the maximum subarray sum, and then computes a result by adding the sum and the maximum subarray sum, and then repeatedly adding twice the maximum subarray sum, modulo 1000000007, k-1 times. The final result is printed to standard output.
