The only variable in the loop head is variable x and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is 0, tmp is 0, _ is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the x is the first integer in the list.
State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is 0, tmp is 0, _ is 0, x is the first integer in the list**
