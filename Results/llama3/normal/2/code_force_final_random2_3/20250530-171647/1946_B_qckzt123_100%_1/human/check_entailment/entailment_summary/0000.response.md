Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program first calculates the sum of the array `s` and the maximum subarray sum `t` using Kadane's algorithm. This is correct because the maximum subarray sum is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.

2. The program then calculates the initial result `ans` by adding the sum `s` and the maximum subarray sum `t`, and taking the modulus with `MOD` to prevent overflow. This is correct because the initial result is the sum of the array and the maximum subarray sum.

3. The program then repeatedly adds twice the maximum subarray sum `t` to the result `ans`, `k-1` times, and takes the modulus with `MOD` after each addition. This is correct because each operation can add the maximum subarray sum to the result, and we do this `k-1` times.

4. Finally, the program prints the final result `ans` to standard output. This is correct because the final result is the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
