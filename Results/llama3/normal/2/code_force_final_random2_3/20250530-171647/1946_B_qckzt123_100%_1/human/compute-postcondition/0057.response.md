Output: **The value of ans, where ans is the result of a complex calculation involving the sum of the integers in list a, the maximum subarray sum of a, the maximum of the last integer in the list and its previous value, the value of x, the value of MOD, and the value of k. Specifically, ans is calculated as ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2 * (2^(k-1) * t % MOD) % MOD + 2 * (t % MOD) + 2 * (t % MOD) + ... + 2 * (2^(k-1) * t % MOD) % MOD, where s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of tmp and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value, tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a, MOD is 1000000007, and k is an integer at least 1.**
