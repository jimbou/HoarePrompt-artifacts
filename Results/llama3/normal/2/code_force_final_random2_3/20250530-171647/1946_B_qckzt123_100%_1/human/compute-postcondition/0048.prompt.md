Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer greater than 1, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 1, a is a list of n integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 1, x is the last integer in the list, tmp is 0, t is the maximum of tmp and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and tmp, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2^(k-1) * t % MOD, i is k-1, t is 2^(k-1) * t % MOD, and ans is printed
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    tmp += x
    if tmp < 0:
        tmp = 0
    t = max(tmp, t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer greater than 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `stdin` contains `T-4` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `k` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is 1, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of `x` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`, `ans` is ((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD` + 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, `i` is `k-1`, the current value of `t` is 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, and the current value of `ans` is printed, if `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer greater than 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `stdin` contains `T-4` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `k` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is 1, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of `x` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`, `ans` is ((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD` + 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, `i` is `k-1`, the current value of `t` is 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, and the current value of `ans` is printed. If `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is an integer greater than 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `stdin` contains `T-4` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `k` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is 1, `tmp` is increased by `x`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of `x` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`, `ans` is ((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD` + 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, `i` is `k-1`, the current value of `t` is 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, and the current value of `ans` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
