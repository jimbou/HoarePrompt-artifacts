The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans`.

To understand the value of `ans`, let's break down the variables and operations involved:

- `s` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`. Since `a` is an empty list, `s` is 0.
- `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `tmp`. Since `tmp` is 0 and the list `a` is empty (so there are no last integer and previous value), `t` is 0.
- `ans` is calculated as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2^(k-1) * t % MOD`. Given that `s` and `t` are both 0, the expression simplifies to `((0 + 0) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2^(k-1) * 0 % MOD`.
- Since `MOD` is 1000000007, the expression further simplifies to `(0 % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 0`, which is equivalent to `MOD % MOD + 0`, resulting in just `MOD`.
- However, there's an additional term `2^(k-1) * t % MOD`. Since `t` is 0, this term is also 0.

Therefore, the value of `ans` is `MOD`, which is 1000000007.

Output: **1000000007**
