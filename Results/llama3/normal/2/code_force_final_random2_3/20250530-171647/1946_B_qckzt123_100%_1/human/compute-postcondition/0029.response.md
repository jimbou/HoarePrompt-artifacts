The code prints the value of `ans` which is the result of the expression `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2^(k-1) * t % MOD`, where `s` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `tmp`, `MOD` is 1000000007, and `k` is an integer at least 1.
Output: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 1, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, x is the last integer in the list, tmp is 0, t is the maximum of tmp and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and tmp, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2^(k-1) * t % MOD, i is k-1, t is 2^(k-1) * t % MOD, and ans is printed**
