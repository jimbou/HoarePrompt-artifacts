Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer greater than 0, `MOD` is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `k` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least `n` integers, `x` is the nth integer in the list, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is 0, `tmp` is the maximum subarray sum of `a` plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list, `t` is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of `a` plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list and the maximum of `x` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`, `ans` is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, `i` is k-2. If the maximum subarray sum of `a` plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list is less than 0, then the maximum subarray sum of `a` plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list is 0 and `t` is the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`. Otherwise, the maximum subarray sum of `a` plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list is not changed and `t` is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of `a` plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list and the maximum of `x` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k - 1):
    t *= 2
    t %= MOD
    ans += t
    ans %= MOD


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 2, a is a list of n integers that must have at least n integers, x is the nth integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list, t is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 * t) % MOD, i is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 2, a is a list of n integers that must have at least n integers, x is the nth integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list, t is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 * t) % MOD + t, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 3, a is a list of n integers that must have at least n integers, x is the nth integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list, t is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x, ans is (((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 * t) % MOD + t) % MOD, i is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
