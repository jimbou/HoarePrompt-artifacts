Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 2, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, x is the last integer in the list, tmp is 0, t is the maximum of tmp and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and tmp, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is 0, t is 0**

The code block modifies the values of `t` and `ans`. The first line doubles the value of `t`, and the second line takes the modulus of the new value of `t` with `MOD`, effectively resetting `t` to 0. The third line adds the new value of `t` (which is 0) to `ans`, and the fourth line takes the modulus of the new value of `ans` with `MOD`, leaving `ans` unchanged. The rest of the variables remain unaffected.
