Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `stdin` contains `T-4` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `k` is an integer at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is 1, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of `x` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and `x`, `ans` is ((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD` + 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, `i` is `k-1`, the current value of `t` is 2^(`k-1`) * `t` % `MOD`, and the current value of `ans` is printed. `tmp` is increased by `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `tmp` has been increased by the value of `x`, which is the third integer in the list `a`.
