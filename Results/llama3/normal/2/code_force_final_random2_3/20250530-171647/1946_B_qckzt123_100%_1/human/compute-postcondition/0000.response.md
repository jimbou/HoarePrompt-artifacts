Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 × 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).**

The first line assigns the value 1000000007 to MOD. The second line reads the number of test cases from stdin and assigns it to T. Since T is now equal to the number of test cases, stdin contains T-1 test cases. No other variables are affected.
