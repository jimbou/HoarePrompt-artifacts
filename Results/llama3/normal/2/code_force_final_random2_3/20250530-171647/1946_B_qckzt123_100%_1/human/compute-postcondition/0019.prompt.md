Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is 0, tmp is 0, _ is 0
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    tmp += x
    if tmp < 0:
        tmp = 0
    t = max(tmp, t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, s is the sum of the integers in a, t is the maximum of 0 and tmp, _ is 0, x is the first integer in the list, and tmp is 0 if the first integer in the list is negative, otherwise tmp remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, x is the second integer in the list, t is the maximum of 0 and the sum of the second integer in the list and its previous value and tmp.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is an integer greater than 0, `MOD` is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, `s` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `_` is 0, `x` is the third integer in the list, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the third integer in the list and its previous value and `tmp`. If `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` is increased by the third integer in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
