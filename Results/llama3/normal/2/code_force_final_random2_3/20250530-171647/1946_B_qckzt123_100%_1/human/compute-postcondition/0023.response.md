The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be at least 3.
State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 3, a is an empty list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, x is the last integer in the list, tmp is 0, t is the maximum of tmp and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and tmp, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD, i is 1, t is 0**
