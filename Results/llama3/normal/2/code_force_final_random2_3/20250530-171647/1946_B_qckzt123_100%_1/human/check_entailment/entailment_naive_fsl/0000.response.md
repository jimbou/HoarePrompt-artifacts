Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when k is 0. In this case, the program should simply return the sum of the array modulo 10^9 + 7, but instead, it tries to calculate the maximum sum of the array after k operations, which is not applicable when k is 0.

For example, if the input is:

1
5 0
4 -2 8 -12 9

The program should return 17, but instead, it returns 0.

The correct code should add a special case to handle k = 0, for example:

if k == 0:
    print(sum(a) % MOD)
else:
    # rest of the code
