Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 1, a is a list of n integers that must have at least n integers, x is the nth integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list, t is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x, ans is (((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 * t) % MOD + t) % MOD + ... + (2^(k-1) * t) % MOD, i is k-1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of `ans` and `i`. The value of `ans` is the sum of the initial value of `ans` and the sum of the terms `(2^j * t) % MOD` for `j` ranging from 0 to `k-2`, and the value of `i` is `k-1`.
