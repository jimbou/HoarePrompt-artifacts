Postcondition: ***T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, x is the second integer in the list. If the sum of the second integer in the list and its previous value is negative, t is 0. Otherwise, t is the maximum of 0 and the sum of the second integer in the list and its previous value.***
