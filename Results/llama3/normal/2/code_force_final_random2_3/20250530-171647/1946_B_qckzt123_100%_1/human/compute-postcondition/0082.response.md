Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 200000 inclusive, k is an integer at least 2, a is a list of n integers that must have at least n integers, x is the nth integer in the list, s is the sum of the integers in a, _ is 0, tmp is the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list, t is the maximum of the maximum subarray sum of a plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list plus the nth integer in the list and the maximum of x and the maximum of 0 and the sum of the last integer in the list and its previous value and x, ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (2 * t) % MOD + t, i is 1**

The code block modifies the values of `t` and `ans`. The first line doubles the value of `t`, and the second line takes the modulus of `t` with `MOD` to ensure it stays within a certain range. The third line adds the modified `t` to `ans`, and the fourth line takes the modulus of `ans` with `MOD` to keep it within the same range. The final state includes the updated values of `t` and `ans`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
