Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and returning the absolute difference between the two counts. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together, resulting in a penalty equal to the absolute difference between the two counts.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When the input string contains only '+' characters, the program returns the length of the string, which is the minimum possible penalty.
* When the input string contains only '-' characters, the program returns the length of the string, which is the minimum possible penalty.
* When the input string contains a mix of '+' and '-' characters, the program returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is the minimum possible penalty.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input string is empty or contains only one character.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
