Output State: **expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least length characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, char is the last character in the expression. count is equal to the number of '+' characters in the expression.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the expression remains the same string of "+" and "-" characters, the length remains the same, and the char variable holds the last character in the expression. The count variable has been incremented for each "+" character in the expression, so it now holds the total number of "+" characters in the expression.
