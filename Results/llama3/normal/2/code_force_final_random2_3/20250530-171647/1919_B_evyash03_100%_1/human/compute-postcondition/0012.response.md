Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code `sub = length - count` assigns a new value to the variable `sub`. The value of `sub` is calculated by subtracting the value of `count` from the value of `length`.

From the initial state, we know that `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of the `expression` string, and `count` is equal to the number of '+' characters in the `expression` string.

Since `length` is equal to the length of the `expression` string, and `expression` consists only of '+' and '-' characters, the value of `length` is also equal to the total number of '+' and '-' characters in the `expression` string.

The value of `count` is equal to the number of '+' characters in the `expression` string. Therefore, the value of `length - count` is equal to the number of '-' characters in the `expression` string.

So, the value of `sub` is assigned the number of '-' characters in the `expression` string.

The values of the other variables (`expression`, `length`, `char`, and `count`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least length characters, `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression`, `char` is the last character in the `expression`, `count` is equal to the number of '+' characters in the `expression`, and `sub` is equal to the number of '-' characters in the `expression`.**
