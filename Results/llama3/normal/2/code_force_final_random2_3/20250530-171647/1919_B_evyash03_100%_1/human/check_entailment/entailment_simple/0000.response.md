Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' characters in the input string and then returning the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters.

This approach is correct because the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the array is split into subarrays with alternating sums of 1 and -1. The absolute difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters represents the minimum possible penalty.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
