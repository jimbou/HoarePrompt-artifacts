Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `expression` and its length `length` as input. It then counts the number of '+' characters in the string and calculates the number of '-' characters by subtracting the count of '+' characters from the length of the string. Finally, it returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

This logic is correct because the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the arrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` are split such that the sum of each array is either 1 or -1. This is because the penalty of an array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the absolute value of 1 or -1 is 1. Therefore, the minimum possible penalty is the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters in the string.

The execution summary also confirms that the function correctly calculates and returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in a given string expression.

Correctness: **True**
