#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression.
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
        
    #State: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least length characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, char is the last character in the expression. count is equal to the number of '+' characters in the expression.
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)
    #The program returns the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in a given string expression, ensuring the string has at least a specified length.
