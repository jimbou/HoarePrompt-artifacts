The only variable in the loop head is variable `char` and `expression`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If the `expression` has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `expression` has at least 2 characters, `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression`, `char` is the second character in the `expression`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `expression` must have at least 3 characters and the `char` is the third character in the `expression`. Also, `length` must be a positive integer equal to the length of `expression` which is at least 3. If the first character in the `expression` is "+", then `count` is 2, otherwise `count` is 1. Since we do not know the first character in the `expression` we cannot adjust `count` so we omit it.
State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 3 characters, `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression` which is at least 3, `char` is the third character in the `expression`.**
