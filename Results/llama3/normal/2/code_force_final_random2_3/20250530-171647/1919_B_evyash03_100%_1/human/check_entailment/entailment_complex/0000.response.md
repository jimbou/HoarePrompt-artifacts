Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression`. This is equivalent to finding the absolute value of the sum of the array represented by the string, since '+' characters represent 1 and '-' characters represent -1.

The program does not explicitly split the array into subarrays, but it is not necessary to do so. The minimum possible penalty is achieved when the array is split into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is either 0 or as close to 0 as possible. This is because the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, so minimizing the absolute value of the sum minimizes the penalty.

Since the program calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, it effectively finds the minimum possible penalty. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
