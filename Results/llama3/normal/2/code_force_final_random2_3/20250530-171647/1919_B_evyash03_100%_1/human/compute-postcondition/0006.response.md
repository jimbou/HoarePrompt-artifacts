Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" that must have at least 2 characters, `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression`, `count` is 2 if the first character in the `expression` is "+", otherwise `count` is 1, `char` is the second character in the expression**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. If the first character in the `expression` is "+", then `count` is now 2. Otherwise, `count` remains 1. The values of `expression`, `length`, and `char` remain unchanged.
