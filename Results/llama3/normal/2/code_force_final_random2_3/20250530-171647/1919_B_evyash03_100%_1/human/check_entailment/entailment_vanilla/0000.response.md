Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting a given array into non-empty subarrays. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes an expression and its length as input. It counts the number of '+' characters in the expression and calculates the number of '-' characters by subtracting the count from the length. It then returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the expression and the expression itself. It then calls the `func_1` function with the expression and its length as arguments and prints the result.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The `func_1` function correctly counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the expression and returns the absolute difference between them, which is the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **True**
