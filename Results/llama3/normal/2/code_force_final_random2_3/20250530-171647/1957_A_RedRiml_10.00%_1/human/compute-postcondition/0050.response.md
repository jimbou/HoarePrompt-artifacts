The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `palka`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `palka`. If `palka` has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in `palka`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `palka` must have at least 2 integers and `i` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is either an empty list or a list containing the first integer in `palka`, `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`. If the first integer in `palka` does not exist as a key in dictionary `d`, then `d` is updated with the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1. Otherwise, the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is updated to contain the first integer in `palka`.**
