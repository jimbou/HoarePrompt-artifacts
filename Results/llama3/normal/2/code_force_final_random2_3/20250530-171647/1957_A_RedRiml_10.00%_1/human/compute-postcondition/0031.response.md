Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains at least 2 integers, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka, shapes is 1 more than its previous value, j is the second integer in the list pl**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains the same, stdin still contains w-2 lines of input, `ln` is still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is still an empty list, `pl` is still a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `d` is still a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `palka`, but the value of `shapes` has been incremented by 1, and `j` is still the second integer in the list `pl`.
