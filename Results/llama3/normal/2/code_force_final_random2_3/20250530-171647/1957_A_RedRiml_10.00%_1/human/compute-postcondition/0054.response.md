Output State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list containing the first integer in `palka`, `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`, `d` is updated with the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1 if it does not exist, otherwise the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `pl` is updated to include the first integer in `palka`. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` is updated according to the initial state conditions. The number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d` is still represented by `shapes`.
