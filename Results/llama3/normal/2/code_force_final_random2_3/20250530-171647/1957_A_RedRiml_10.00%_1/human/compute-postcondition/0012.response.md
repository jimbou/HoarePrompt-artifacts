To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in palka:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `i` and `palka`.

According to the current state, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, and `i` is the first integer in the list `palka`.

For the loop to execute again, `palka` must have at least 2 integers, and `i` must be the second integer in the list `palka`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, if the second integer in the list `palka` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the second integer in the list `palka`, otherwise `pl` remains empty, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or one more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d`, i is the second integer in the list `palka`.**
