Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, if the second integer in the list `palka` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the second integer in the list `palka`, otherwise `pl` remains empty, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value of 1, i is the second integer in the list `palka`.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been updated to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, with `w` still being an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0, stdin still containing w-2 lines of input, `ln` still being an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` still being a list of integers with at least 2 integers, and `pl` still containing the second integer in the list `palka` if it's not already in `pl`, or remaining empty otherwise.
