Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, if the first integer in the list `palka` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the first integer in the list `palka`, otherwise `pl` remains empty, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or one more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d`, i is the first integer in the list `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, if the second integer in the list `palka` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the second integer in the list `palka`, otherwise `pl` remains empty, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or one more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was not in `pl`, or two more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was in `pl`, i is the second integer in the list `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, if the third integer in the list `palka` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the third integer in the list `palka`, otherwise `pl` remains empty, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or one more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was not in `pl`, or two more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was in `pl`, i is the third integer in the list `palka`. If `i` is not in `d`, then the value of `d[i]` is 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains `i` and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
