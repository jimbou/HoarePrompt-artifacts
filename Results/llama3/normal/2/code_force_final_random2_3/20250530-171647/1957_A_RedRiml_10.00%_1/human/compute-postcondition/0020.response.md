Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, if the third integer in the list `palka` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the third integer in the list `palka`, otherwise `pl` remains empty, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or one more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was not in `pl`, or two more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was in `pl`, i is the third integer in the list `palka`, and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `d[i]` has been incremented by 1. This means that if `i` was already in `d`, its value has increased by 1, and if `i` was not in `d`, it has been added with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
