Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 3 elements, `shapes` is not defined, `i` is the third element of `palka`, `pl` is updated according to the loop body and contains the third element of `palka` as its last element, `d` is updated with a key `i` and value 1 if `d.get(i)` is `None`, otherwise the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and greater than 0. The value of `ln` remains an integer. The list `palka` still contains integers and has at least 3 elements. The variable `shapes` is still not defined. The value of `i` is still the third element of `palka`. The list `pl` is updated with the third element of `palka` as its last element. The dictionary `d` is updated with a key `i` and value 1 if `d.get(i)` is `None`, otherwise the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1.
