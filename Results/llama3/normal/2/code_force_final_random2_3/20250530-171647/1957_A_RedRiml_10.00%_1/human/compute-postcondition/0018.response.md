The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list  palka, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the palka.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, palka has at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in the list, w is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, if the second integer in the list `palka` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the second integer in the list `palka`, otherwise `pl` remains empty, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or one more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was not in `pl`, or two more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was in `pl`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the i is the third integer in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, if the third integer in the list `palka` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the third integer in the list `palka`, otherwise `pl` remains empty, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or one more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was not in `pl`, or two more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was in `pl`, i is the third integer in the list `palka`.**
