Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `pl` is a list that has at least three elements, `j` is the third element in the list, `shapes` is 3. If the value of `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is `j` and the value is greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, the state of `palka`, `d` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains unchanged between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is still an integer, `pl` is still a list that has at least three elements, `j` is still the third element in the list. The value of `shapes` has been incremented by 1 and is now 3. The state of `palka` and `d` remains the same as before, with `palka` being an empty list and `d` having at least one key-value pair where the key is `j` and the value is greater than or equal to 3, if the value of `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, the state of `palka` and `d` remains unchanged.
