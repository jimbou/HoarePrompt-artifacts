Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, pl is an empty list, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with value 1, i is the first integer in the list `palka`.**

In this output state, the value of `d` has been updated to include the key `i` with value 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains w-2 lines of input, and the values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, and `pl` are the same as in the initial state.
