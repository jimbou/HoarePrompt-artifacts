Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, if the second integer in the list `palka` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the second integer in the list `palka`, otherwise `pl` remains empty, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 2 if `i` was not previously in `d` and was in `pl`, or two more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was in `pl`, or one more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was not in `pl`, i is the second integer in the list `palka`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains the same, stdin still contains w-2 lines of input, each line containing an integer n followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The value of `ln` remains the same. The list `palka` still has at least 2 integers. The list `pl` either contains the second integer in `palka` or remains empty. The dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` with a value that is either 2 if `i` was not previously in `d` and was in `pl`, or two more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was in `pl`, or one more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was not in `pl`. The value of `i` is still the second integer in the list `palka`.
