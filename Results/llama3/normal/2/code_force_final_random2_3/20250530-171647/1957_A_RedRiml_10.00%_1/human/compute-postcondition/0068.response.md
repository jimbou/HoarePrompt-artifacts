The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and pl, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list pl.  If the list has at least 2 unique integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, pl has at least one unique integer, j is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 unique integers and the j is the second integer in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list containing at least one integer, `pl` is a list containing at least 2 unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `palka`, `j` is the second integer in the list. If the current value of the frequency of `j` in `palka` is 3 or more, then `shapes` is 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.**
