Output State: **w is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, ln is an integer, palka is a list containing integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, and shapes is not defined**.

In this output state, the value of `w` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `ln` is updated to the integer value of the input. The list `palka` is updated to contain the integers from the input. The list `pl` is reset to an empty list. The dictionary `d` is also reset to an empty dictionary. The variable `shapes` is not defined in the output state as it is not assigned a value in the code.
