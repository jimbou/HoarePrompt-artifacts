Output State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where the value of key `i` is increased by 1, `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`, `i` is the first integer in `palka`. The value of `i` exists as a key in dictionary `d`**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been incremented by 1, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` now contains the updated value for the key `i`, which is the first integer in the list `palka`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
