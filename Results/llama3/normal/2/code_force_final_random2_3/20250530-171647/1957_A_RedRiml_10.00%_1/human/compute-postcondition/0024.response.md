Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains all unique integers from the list palka, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is as follows:

*   The value of `w` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0.
*   The content of stdin remains unchanged, still containing w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).
*   The value of ln remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
*   The list palka is empty because the loop has iterated over all its elements.
*   The list pl contains all unique integers from the list palka.
*   The dictionary d contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka.
