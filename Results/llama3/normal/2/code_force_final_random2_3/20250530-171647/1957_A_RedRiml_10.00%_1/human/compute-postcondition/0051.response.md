Output State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is either an empty list or a list containing the first integer in `palka`, `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`, `d` is updated with the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1.**

The code updates the dictionary `d` with the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state includes the updated dictionary `d` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
