Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where the value of the key `i` is incremented by 1, `shapes` is not defined, `i` is the first element in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the first element in the list `palka`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` still contains the key `i`, but its value is now incremented by 1.
