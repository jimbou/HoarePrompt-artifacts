The code prints the value of `shapes`, which is equal to the number of iterations of the loop. Since the loop iterates `w` times, where `w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, the value of `shapes` will be the same as the value of `w`.

Output: **w (where w is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0)**
