Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains all unique integers from the list palka, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka, shapes is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains at least 1 integer, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka. If the value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, then shapes is 1. Otherwise, the state of shapes is not changed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains at least 2 integers, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka. If the value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, then shapes is 1 more than its previous value. Otherwise, the state of shapes remains unchanged, j is the second integer in the list pl

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains at least 3 integers, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka. If the value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, then shapes is 1 more than its previous value. Otherwise, the state of shapes remains unchanged, j is the third integer in the list pl




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
