Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from `palka` and values are their respective counts, and `shapes` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `w` and `ln` remain unchanged, `palka` is empty, `pl` contains all unique integers from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and its value is the count of that integer in `palka`, and `shapes` is still not defined.
