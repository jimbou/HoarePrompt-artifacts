Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, shapes is the number of integers in pl that have a value of at least 3 in d, and the number of shapes is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is either an empty list or a list containing the first integer in `palka`, `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`. If the first integer in `palka` does not exist as a key in dictionary `d`, then `d` is updated with the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1. Otherwise, the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is updated to contain the first integer in `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, if the first integer in `palka` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is updated to contain the first integer in `palka` and `d` is updated with the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1 if it does not exist, otherwise the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is increased by 1. `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the first integer in `palka` and `i`, and the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `pl` contains only the first integer in `palka`. In both cases, if the first integer in `palka` was not in `d`, then `d` contains the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1, otherwise the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is increased by 1. `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d` which is 0 if the first integer in `palka` was not in `d` or 1 if the first integer in `palka` was already in `d` with a value of 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
