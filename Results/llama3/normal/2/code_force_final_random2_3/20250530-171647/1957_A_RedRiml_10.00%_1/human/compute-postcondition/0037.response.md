Based on the precondition, the code prints the number of integers in the list `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in the dictionary `d`. Since `pl` is a list of unique integers from the list `palka` and `d` contains the number of occurrences of each integer in `palka`, the code is essentially counting the number of integers that appear at least three times in the input data.

The input data consists of `w-2` lines, each containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. The integers in each line are added to the list `palka`. The dictionary `d` is then used to count the occurrences of each integer in `palka`.

Since `palka` is an empty list initially, the list `pl` will also be empty. Therefore, the dictionary `d` will not contain any keys with a value of at least 3.

Output: **0**
