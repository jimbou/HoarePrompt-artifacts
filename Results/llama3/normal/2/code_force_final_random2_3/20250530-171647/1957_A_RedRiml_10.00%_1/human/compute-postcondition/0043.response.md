Output State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1, `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`, `i` is the first integer in `palka`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `shapes` remains the same as in the initial state. The dictionary `d` now has the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1. The value of `i` is still the first integer in `palka`.
