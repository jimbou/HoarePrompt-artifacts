To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `j` and the list `pl`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the second integer in the list `pl`. For the loop to execute again, `pl` must have at least 3 integers, and `j` must be the third integer in the list `pl`.

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains at least 3 integers, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka. If the value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, then shapes is 1 more than its previous value. Otherwise, the state of shapes remains unchanged, j is the third integer in the list pl**
