Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains at least 1 integer, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka, shapes is 1, j is the first integer in the list pl, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `shapes` being equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The stdin still contains w-2 lines of input, and the list `pl` still contains at least one integer, with `j` being the first integer in the list. The dictionary `d` continues to store the number of occurrences of each integer in the list `palka`, which remains empty.
