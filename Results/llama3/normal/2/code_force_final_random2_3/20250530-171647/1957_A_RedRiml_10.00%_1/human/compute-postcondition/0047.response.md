Postcondition: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`. If the first integer in `palka` does not exist as a key in dictionary `d`, then `d` is updated with the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1. Otherwise, the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is increased by 1. The current value of `i` is not in the list `pl`.**
