According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `pl`. If `pl` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `pl` is an empty list, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `pl` is not empty and `j` is the first element in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that is not empty, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is 0, `j` is the first element in the list**
