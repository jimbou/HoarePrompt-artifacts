To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in palka:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of the `palka` list.

The current state is:

* `w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0
* `ln` is an integer
* `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 2 elements
* `shapes` is not defined
* `i` is the second element of `palka`
* `pl` is updated according to the loop body

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when the loop iterates again. Since the loop iterates over the elements of `palka`, the only variable that changes is `i`, which will take on the value of the next element in the list.

Since `i` is currently the second element of `palka`, the next element will be the third element of `palka`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 3 elements, `shapes` is not defined, `i` is the third element of `palka`, `pl` is updated according to the loop body**

Note that we only updated the state of `i` and `palka`, as they are the only variables in the loop head that can change. The other variables remain unchanged.
