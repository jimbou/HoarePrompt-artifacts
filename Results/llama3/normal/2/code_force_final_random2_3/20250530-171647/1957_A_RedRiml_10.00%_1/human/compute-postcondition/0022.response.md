Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, pl contains the third integer in the list `palka`, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or one more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was not in `pl`, or two more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was in `pl`, i is the third integer in the list `palka`. If `i` is not in `d`, then the value of `d[i]` is 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains the same, stdin still contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100). The value of ln remains the same. The list `palka` still has at least 3 integers. The list `pl` now contains the third integer in the list `palka`. The dictionary `d` still contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or one more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was not in `pl`, or two more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was in `pl`. The value of `i` is still the third integer in the list `palka`. If `i` is not in `d`, then the value of `d[i]` is 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.
