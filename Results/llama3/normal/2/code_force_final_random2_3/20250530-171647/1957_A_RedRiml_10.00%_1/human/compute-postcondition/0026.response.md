To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the list `pl`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If the list `pl` has at least 1 integer, the loop executes. Since `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique integers from the list `palka`, and `palka` is an empty list, `pl` must also be empty for the loop to not execute. However, since we want the loop to execute, `pl` must have at least 1 integer.

At the start of the loop, `j` is the first integer in the list `pl`.

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains at least 1 integer, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka, shapes is 0, j is the first integer in the list pl**
