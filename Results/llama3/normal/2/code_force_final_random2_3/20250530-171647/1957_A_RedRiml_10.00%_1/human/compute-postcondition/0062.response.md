Output State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `palka`, and `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same range for `w` and `ln` as in the initial state. The list `palka` will be empty because all its elements have been processed by the loop. The list `pl` will contain all unique integers from the original `palka` list, and the dictionary `d` will store the frequency of each integer in `palka`. The variable `shapes` will count the number of integers in `pl` that appear at least three times in `palka`.
