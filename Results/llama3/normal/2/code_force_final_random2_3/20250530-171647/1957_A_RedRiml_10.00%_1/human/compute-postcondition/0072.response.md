Output State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list containing at least one integer, `pl` is a list containing at least 3 unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `palka`, `j` is the third integer in the list. If the current value of the frequency of `j` in `palka` is 3 or more, then `shapes` is 3. Otherwise, `shapes` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been incremented by 1. If the frequency of `j` in `palka` is 3 or more, `shapes` is now 3. Otherwise, `shapes` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
