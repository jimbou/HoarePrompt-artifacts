Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 3 elements, `shapes` is not defined, `i` is the third element of `palka`, `pl` is updated according to the loop body. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` contains the third element of `palka` as its last element, `d` is updated with a key `i` and value 1 if `d.get(i)` is `None`, otherwise the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1.***
