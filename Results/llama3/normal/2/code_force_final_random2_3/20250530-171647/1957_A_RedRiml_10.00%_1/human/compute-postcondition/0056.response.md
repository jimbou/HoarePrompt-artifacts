The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `palka`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and `i` is the third integer in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, if the first integer in `palka` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is updated to contain the first integer in `palka` and `d` is updated with the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1 if it does not exist, otherwise the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is increased by 1. `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`.**
