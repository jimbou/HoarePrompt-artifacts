Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, pl is an empty list, d is a dictionary that has a key i with a value that is one more than its previous value, i is the first integer in the list `palka`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains the same, stdin still contains w-2 lines of input, `ln` is still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is still a list of integers with at least one integer, `pl` is still an empty list. The only change is in the dictionary `d`, where the value associated with the key `i` (which is the first integer in the list `palka`) is incremented by 1.
