Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 1 element, `shapes` is not defined. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is updated to contain the first element of `palka`. If `d` does not contain the key `i`, then `d` is updated to contain a key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1. If `d` already contains the key `i`, then the value of the key `i` is incremented by 1.***
