Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, if the first integer in `palka` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is updated to contain the first integer in `palka` and `d` is updated with the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1 if it does not exist, otherwise the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is increased by 1. `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`.***
