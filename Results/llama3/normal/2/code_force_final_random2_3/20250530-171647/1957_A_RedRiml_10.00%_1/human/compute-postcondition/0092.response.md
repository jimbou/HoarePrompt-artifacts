Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 2 elements, `shapes` is not defined, `i` is the second element of `palka`, `pl` is updated with the second element of `palka` appended to it, `d` is updated according to the loop body.**

In this output state, the value of `pl` has been updated by appending the second element of `palka` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `d` is still updated according to the loop body, which means if `d` does not have key `i`, `d` is updated with key `i` having value 1, and if `d` already has key `i`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1.
