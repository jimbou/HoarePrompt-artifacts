Output State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `palka`, and `shapes` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `palka` is still empty, and the list `pl` contains no unique integers. The dictionary `d` is also empty, as there are no integers in `palka` to count their frequencies. The variables `w` and `ln` retain their original ranges.
