Output State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is a list containing the first integer in `palka`, `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`, `d` is a dictionary where the first integer in `palka` is a key with a value of either 1 or more than 1, and `i` is the first integer in `palka`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been added to the list `pl`. The dictionary `d` has been updated with the first integer in `palka` as a key, and its value is either 1 (if it didn't exist before) or more than 1 (if it already existed). The other variables remain unchanged.
