Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list that is not empty, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is `j` and the value is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is 1, and `j` is the first element in the list `pl`.**

The code increments the value of `shapes` by 1. The initial state of `shapes` is 0, so after the code is executed, `shapes` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
