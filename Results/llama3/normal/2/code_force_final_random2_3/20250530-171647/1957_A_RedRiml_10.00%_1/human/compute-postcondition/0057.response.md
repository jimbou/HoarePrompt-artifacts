Output State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `pl` contains the first integer in `palka`, `d` contains the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1, `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d` which is 0 in this case.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` is updated to 1, where `i` is the first integer in `palka`. The values of `w`, `ln`, and `palka` remain unchanged. The list `pl` contains the first integer in `palka`, and the dictionary `d` contains the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1. The value of `shapes` is 0, since the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is 1, which is less than 3.
