Output State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `pl` contains the first integer in `palka`, `d` contains the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 2 if it was already in `d`, otherwise the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is increased by 1, `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` and `ln` remains the same. The list `palka` still has at least 3 integers. The list `pl` still contains the first integer in `palka`. The dictionary `d` now has the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 2 if it was already in `d`, otherwise the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is increased by 1. The number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d` is still tracked by `shapes`.
