Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, and `shapes` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, and `d` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The only change is that `shapes` is now defined and assigned the value 0.
