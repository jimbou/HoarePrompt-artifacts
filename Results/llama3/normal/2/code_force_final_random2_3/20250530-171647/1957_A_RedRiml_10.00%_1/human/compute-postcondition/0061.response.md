Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the first integer in `palka` and `i`, and the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `pl` contains only the first integer in `palka`. In both cases, if the first integer in `palka` was not in `d`, then `d` contains the first integer in `palka` as a key with a value of 1, otherwise the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is increased by 1. `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d` which is 0 if the first integer in `palka` was not in `d` or 1 if the first integer in `palka` was already in `d` with a value of 2.***
