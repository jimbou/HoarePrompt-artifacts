Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, pl is a list containing the first integer in the list `palka`, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or one more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d`, i is the first integer in the list `palka`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `w` is still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0. The stdin still contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100). `ln` is still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. `palka` is still a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer. `pl` is now a list containing the first integer in the list `palka`. `d` is still a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or one more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d`. `i` is still the first integer in the list `palka`.
