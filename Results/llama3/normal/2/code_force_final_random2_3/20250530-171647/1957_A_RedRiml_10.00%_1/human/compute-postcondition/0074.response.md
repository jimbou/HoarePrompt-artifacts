Output State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list containing at least one integer, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `palka`, and `shapes` is equal to the number of integers in `palka` that have a frequency of 3 or more.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `w` and `ln` remain unchanged, `palka` and `pl` contain the same list of unique integers, `d` still stores the frequency of each integer in `palka`, and `shapes` now represents the total count of integers in `palka` that appear three or more times.
