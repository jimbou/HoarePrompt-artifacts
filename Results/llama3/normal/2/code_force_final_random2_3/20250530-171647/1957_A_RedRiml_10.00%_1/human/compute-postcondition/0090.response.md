Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 2 elements, `shapes` is not defined, `i` is the second element of `palka`, `pl` is updated according to the loop body, `d[i]` is incremented by 1**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is the second element of the list `palka`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `palka` still contains at least 2 elements, and `w` is still an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and greater than 0. The variable `shapes` is still not defined.
