Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, `shapes` is not defined, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`. If `d` does not contain the key `i`, then `d` is updated to contain a key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1. If `d` already contains the key `i`, then the value of the key `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains the same, an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and greater than 0. The value of `ln` also remains the same, an integer. The list `palka` still contains integers and has at least one element. The list `pl` now contains the first element of `palka`. The variable `shapes` is still not defined. The value of `i` is still the first element in the list `palka`. The dictionary `d` is updated to contain the key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is either 1 (if `d` did not contain the key `i`) or the incremented value of the key `i` (if `d` already contained the key `i`).
