Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 2 elements, `shapes` is not defined, `i` is the second element of `palka`, `pl` is updated according to the loop body. If `d` does not have key `i`, `d` is updated with key `i` having value 1. If `d` already has key `i`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` is updated with the second element of `palka` appended to it.***
