Output State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is either an empty list or a list containing the first integer in `palka`, `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`, and the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` in dictionary `d` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `shapes` is still the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`, but this value may have changed due to the increment of `d[i]`. The list `palka` still has at least 2 integers, and `pl` is still either an empty list or a list containing the first integer in `palka`. The integer `w` is still between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, and `ln` is still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
