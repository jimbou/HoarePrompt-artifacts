Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains `w` lines of input, where each line contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(w):
    ln = int(input())
    palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pl = []
    d = {}
    for i in palka:
        if d.get(i) == None:
            d[i] = 1
        else:
            d[i] += 1
        if i not in pl:
            pl.append(i)
    shapes = 0
    for j in pl:
        if d[j] >= 3:
            shapes += 1
    print(shapes)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains all unique integers from the list palka, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka, shapes is the number of integers in pl that have a value of at least 3 in d, and the number of shapes is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list containing at least one integer, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `palka`, and `shapes` is equal to the number of integers in `palka` that have a frequency of 3 or more, and the number of integers in `palka` that have a frequency of 3 or more which is equal to `shapes` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `pl` is a list that has at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, `j` is the last element in the list. If the value of `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is `j` and the value is greater than or equal to 3, and `shapes` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop. Otherwise, the state of `palka`, `d`, and `shapes` remains unchanged, and the number of iterations of the loop which is equal to `shapes` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
