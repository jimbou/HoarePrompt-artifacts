According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list palka. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, w is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, ln is an integer, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, and shapes is not defined. So for the loop to be executed  the list palka must have at least 1 element and the variable i is the first element in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is not defined, `i` is the first element in the list**
