The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and list pl, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list pl.  If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, w is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, d is a dictionary where each key is an integer from palka and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in palka, and shapes is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the j is the first integer in the list.
State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` that must have at least 1 integer, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `palka`, `j` is the first integer in the list, and `shapes` is 0**
