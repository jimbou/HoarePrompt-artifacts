The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `w`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. If `_` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not specified, `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains all unique integers from the list palka, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka, shapes is the number of integers in pl that have a value of at least 3 in d, and the number of shapes is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the variable `_` must be increased by 1 and `w` must be greater than the new value of `_`. Since `_` is not specified, we can assume that it is equal to the number of iterations that have already been executed, which is equal to the number of lines that have already been read from stdin, which is w-1. Therefore, `_` is equal to w-1 and for the loop to execute again `w` must be greater than w-1+1 which is w.
State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, stdin contains w-1 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains all unique integers from the list palka, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka, shapes is the number of integers in pl that have a value of at least 3 in d, and the number of shapes is printed**
