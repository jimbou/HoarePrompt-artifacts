Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains `w` lines of input, where each line contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 100).**

In this output state, the variable `w` has been assigned the value of the first line of input from stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The remaining `w` lines of input in stdin still contain an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where `n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, and each `a_i` is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
