Postcondition: ***`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `pl` is a list that has at least two elements, `j` is the second element in the list. If the value of `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is `j` and the value is greater than or equal to 3, and `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, the state of `palka`, `d`, and `shapes` remains unchanged.***
