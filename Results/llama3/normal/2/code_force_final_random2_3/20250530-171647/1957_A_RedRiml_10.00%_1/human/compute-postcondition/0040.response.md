Output State: **w is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, shapes is the number of integers in pl that have a value of at least 3 in d, and the number of shapes is printed**

In this output state, the value of `w` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `ln` is updated to an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, as it is assigned the integer value of the input. The list `palka` is updated to contain a list of integers, as it is assigned the list of integers from the input. The list `pl` remains empty, as it is not modified by the code. The dictionary `d` remains empty, as it is not modified by the code. The variable `shapes` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The number of shapes is printed, but this does not affect the state of the variables.
