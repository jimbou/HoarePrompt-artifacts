Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary containing a key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1, `shapes` is not defined, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`.**

In this output state, the value of `d` has been updated to include a key-value pair where the key is `i` (which is the first element in the list `palka`) and the value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
