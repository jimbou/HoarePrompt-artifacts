Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

3
6
2 2 2 2 2 2

The program will output 0, but the correct output should be 2, because we can make two squares with side length 2.

The problem is that the program only checks if the count of each stick length is greater than or equal to 3, but it does not consider the case where the count is exactly 2, which can also form a square.

To fix this, the program should also check if the count of each stick length is greater than or equal to 2, and if so, add 1 to the shapes count.
