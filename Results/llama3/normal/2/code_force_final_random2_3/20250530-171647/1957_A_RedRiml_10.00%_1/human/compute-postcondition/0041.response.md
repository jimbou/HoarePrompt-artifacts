The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `palka`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `palka`. If `palka` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `palka` is a list of integers, but we don't know if it's empty or not. So, we need to adjust the state of `palka` to ensure it has at least 1 integer. We also need to adjust the state of `i` to be the first integer in `palka`.

State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is the number of integers in `pl` that have a value of at least 3 in `d`, `i` is the first integer in `palka`**
