To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for j in pl:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `j` and `pl`.

According to the current state, `pl` is a list that is not empty, and `j` is the first element in the list. For the loop to execute again, `pl` must have at least two elements, and `j` must be the second element in the list.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `pl` is a list that has at least two elements, `j` is the second element in the list. If the value of `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is `j` and the value is greater than or equal to 3, and `shapes` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `palka`, `d`, and `shapes` remains unchanged.**
