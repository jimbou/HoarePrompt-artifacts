Output State: **`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list containing at least one integer, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `palka`, `j` is the first integer in the list, the current value of the frequency of `j` in `palka` is 3 or more, and `shapes` is 1.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial properties, but the value of `shapes` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `shapes` being equal to 1. The frequency of `j` in `palka` remains 3 or more, and all other variables retain their initial values and properties.
