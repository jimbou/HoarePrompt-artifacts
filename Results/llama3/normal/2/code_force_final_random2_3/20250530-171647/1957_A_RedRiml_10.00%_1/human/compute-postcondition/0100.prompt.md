Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, ln is an integer, palka is a list containing integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, and shapes is not defined
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 1 element, `shapes` is not defined. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is updated to contain the first element of `palka`. If `d` does not contain the key `i`, then `d` is updated to contain a key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1. If `d` already contains the key `i`, then the value of the key `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 2 elements, `shapes` is not defined, `i` is the second element of `palka`, `pl` is updated according to the loop body. If `d` does not have key `i`, `d` is updated with key `i` having value 1. If `d` already has key `i`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` is updated with the second element of `palka` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 3 elements, `shapes` is not defined, `i` is the third element of `palka`, `pl` is updated according to the loop body. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` contains the third element of `palka` as its last element, `d` is updated with a key `i` and value 1 if `d.get(i)` is `None`, otherwise the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
