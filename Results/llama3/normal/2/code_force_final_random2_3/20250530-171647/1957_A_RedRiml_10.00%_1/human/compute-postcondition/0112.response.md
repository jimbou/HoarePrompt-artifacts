Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `pl` is a list that has at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, `j` is the last element in the list. If the value of `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is `j` and the value is greater than or equal to 3, and `shapes` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop. Otherwise, the state of `palka`, `d`, and `shapes` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `w` and `ln` remain unchanged, the list `pl` has at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, and the variable `j` is the last element in the list. If the value of `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then the list `palka` remains empty, the dictionary `d` has at least one key-value pair where the key is `j` and the value is greater than or equal to 3, and the variable `shapes` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop. Otherwise, the state of `palka`, `d`, and `shapes` remains unchanged.
