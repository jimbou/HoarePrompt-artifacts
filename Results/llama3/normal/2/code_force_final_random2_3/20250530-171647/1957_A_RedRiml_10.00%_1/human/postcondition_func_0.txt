This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the number of integers that appear three or more times in each set of input integers. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the result for each set of input integers. The function reads t+1 lines of input, where t is an integer between 1 and 100, and each of the following t lines contains an integer n followed by n integers. It then counts the frequency of each integer in each set and prints the number of integers that have a frequency of 3 or more. After processing all input, the function leaves stdin empty and does not modify any external state.
