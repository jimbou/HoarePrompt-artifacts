To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for i in palka:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `i` and `palka`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `palka` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `palka` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `palka` must have at least 2 elements.

Since `i` is an element of `palka`, we can infer that `i` will take the value of the next element in `palka`. However, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` without knowing the contents of `palka`.

The other variables `w`, `ln`, `pl`, and `d` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is a list containing integers that must have at least 2 elements, `shapes` is not defined, `i` is the second element of `palka`, `pl` and `d` are updated according to the loop body**
