Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `palka`, and `shapes` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list containing at least one integer, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `palka`, `j` is the first integer in the list. If the current value of the frequency of `j` in `palka` is 3 or more, then `shapes` is 1. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list containing at least one integer, `pl` is a list containing at least 2 unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `palka`, `j` is the second integer in the list. If the current value of the frequency of `j` in `palka` is 3 or more, then `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 1, `ln` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `palka` is a list containing at least one integer, `pl` is a list containing at least 3 unique integers from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `palka`, `j` is the third integer in the list. If the current value of the frequency of `j` in `palka` is 3 or more, then `shapes` is 3. Otherwise, `shapes` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
