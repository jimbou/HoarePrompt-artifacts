Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains all unique integers from the list palka, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka, shapes is the number of integers in pl that have a value of at least 3 in d.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged. The loop has iterated over all unique integers in the list palka, and for each integer, it has checked if its count in the dictionary d is greater than or equal to 3. If it is, the variable shapes has been incremented by 1. Therefore, the final value of shapes represents the number of integers in pl that have a count of at least 3 in d.
