To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in pl:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `j` and `pl`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `pl` has at least one more integer. At the end of the previous iteration, `pl` contains at least 1 integer.

To execute the loop again, `pl` must have at least 2 integers, and `j` must be the next integer in the list.

State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains at least 2 integers, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka. If the value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, then shapes is 1. Otherwise, the state of shapes is not changed, j is the second integer in the list pl**
