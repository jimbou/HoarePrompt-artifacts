Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, pl contains the second integer in the list `palka`, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or one more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was not in `pl`, or two more than its previous value if `i` was already in `d` and was in `pl`, i is the second integer in the list `palka`.**

In this output state, the value of `pl` has been updated to include the second integer in the list `palka`, which was previously not in `pl`. The other variables remain unchanged.
