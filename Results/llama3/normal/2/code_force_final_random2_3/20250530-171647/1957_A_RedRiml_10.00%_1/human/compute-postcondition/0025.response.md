Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains all unique integers from the list palka, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka, shapes is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `shapes` that has been initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
