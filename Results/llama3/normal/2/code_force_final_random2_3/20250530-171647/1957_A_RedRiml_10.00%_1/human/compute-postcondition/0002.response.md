Output State: **w is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `w` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0. The stdin now contains `w-2` lines of input, each line containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 100). The variable `ln` is assigned an integer value between 1 and 100 inclusive, which is the value of the first integer in the first line of stdin. The variable `palka` is assigned a list of integers, which are the values of the integers in the second line of stdin. The variable `pl` is an empty list, and the variable `d` is an empty dictionary.
