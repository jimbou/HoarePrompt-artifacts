Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, and `shapes` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `pl` is a list that is not empty, `j` is the first element in the list. If the value of `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is `j` and the value is greater than or equal to 3, and `shapes` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `palka`, `d`, and `shapes` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `pl` is a list that has at least two elements, `j` is the second element in the list. If the value of `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is `j` and the value is greater than or equal to 3, and `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, the state of `palka`, `d`, and `shapes` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive and is greater than 0, `ln` is an integer, `pl` is a list that has at least three elements, `j` is the third element in the list. If the value of `j` in dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is `j` and the value is greater than or equal to 3, and `shapes` is 3. Otherwise, the state of `palka`, `d`, and `shapes` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
