Output State: **w is an integer between 0 and 100 inclusive, stdin is empty, ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list containing all unique integers from the input, d is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the input and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in the input, and shapes is equal to the number of integers in the input that have a frequency of 3 or more.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the input has been fully processed, and the output state reflects the final result. The variable `w` has been decremented to 0, indicating that all iterations have been completed. The input `stdin` is empty, as all lines have been read and processed. The variables `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, and `shapes` contain the final results of the processing, with `shapes` holding the total count of integers that appear at least three times in the input.
