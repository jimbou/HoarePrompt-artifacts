Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and is greater than 0, stdin contains w-2 lines of input, where each line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), ln is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, palka is an empty list, pl is a list of integers that contains at least 3 integers, d is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list palka. If the value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, then shapes is 1 more than its previous value. Otherwise, the state of shapes remains unchanged, j is the third integer in the list pl, shapes is increased by 1.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial state except for the variable `shapes`, which is incremented by 1. The value of `shapes` is now 1 more than its previous value. The rest of the variables, including `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, and `j`, remain unchanged.
