Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer equal to n, k is an integer, aa is a list of at least n strings, bb is a list of strings, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the total count of common elements, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, nabors is greater than 1, stdin is empty, and the value of fnd is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of at least `n` strings, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 1, `nabors` is greater than 1, stdin is empty, and the value of `fnd` is being printed, `in_aa` is the `m`-th element in `aa`, `out_aa` is the `(n-m)`-th element in `aa`. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1. Additionally, the count of `in_aa` in `C` is 0, and `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer less than `n` and is incremented by 1, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of at least `n` strings, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 1, `nabors` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, and the value of `fnd` is being printed, `in_aa` is the `(m+1)`-th element in `aa`, `out_aa` is the `(n-m-1)`-th element in `aa`. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then the count of `in_aa` in `D` is incremented by 1, the total count of common elements in `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and the count of `in_aa` in `C` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, then the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1. `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer less than `n-1` and is incremented by 1, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of at least `n` strings, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `aa[:m+1]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 1, `nabors` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, and the value of `fnd` is being printed, `in_aa` is the `(m+2)`-th element in `aa`, `out_aa` is the `(n-m-2)`-th element in `aa`. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
