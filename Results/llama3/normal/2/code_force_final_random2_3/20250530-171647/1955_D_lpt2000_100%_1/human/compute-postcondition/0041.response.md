Output: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer equal to n, k is an integer, aa is a list of at least n strings, bb is a list of strings, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the total count of common elements, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, nabors is greater than 0, stdin is empty, and the value of fnd is being printed, where fnd is 1 if the total count of common elements (pairs_in_D) is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0**
