Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than `m + 1`, `m` is an integer incremented by 1, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of at least `n` strings, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `aa[:m + 1]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `nabors` is greater than 0, stdin is empty. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if it exists, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is 0, then the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decreased by 1.***
