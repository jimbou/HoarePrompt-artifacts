Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `m + 2`, `m` is an integer incremented by 1, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of at least `n` strings, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `aa[:m + 2]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, where `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `nabors` is greater than 0, stdin is empty, in_aa is the next element in aa[m:], out_aa is the next element in aa[:n - m - 1]**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `E[out_aa]` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `aa` still has at least `n` strings, and `m` is still an integer incremented by 1. The Counter objects `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, and `C` still contain the same elements, but the count of `out_aa` in `E` has been reduced by 1. The value of `pairs_in_D` and `fnd` are still the same, and `nabors` is still greater than 0. The stdin is still empty, and the next elements in `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` are still `in_aa` and `out_aa`, respectively, but `out_aa` is now the next element in `aa[:n - m - 1]`.
