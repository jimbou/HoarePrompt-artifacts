Output State: **`nabors` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains n space-separated integers: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The second line contains m space-separated integers: b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6.**

In this output state, the variable `nabors` is assigned the value of the first line of the test case, which contains three space-separated integers: n, m, and k. The stdin now contains the remaining two lines of the test case, which are the n space-separated integers: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and the m space-separated integers: b_1, b_2, ..., b_m.
