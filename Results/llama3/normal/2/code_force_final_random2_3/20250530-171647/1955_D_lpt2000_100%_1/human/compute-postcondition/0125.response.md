Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second and third lines contain n and m space-separated strings, respectively. It then calculates the number of pairs of strings that appear in both lists within a sliding window of size m, and prints the number of positions where the number of such pairs is greater than or equal to k. The function processes all test cases and prints the results for each case.**
