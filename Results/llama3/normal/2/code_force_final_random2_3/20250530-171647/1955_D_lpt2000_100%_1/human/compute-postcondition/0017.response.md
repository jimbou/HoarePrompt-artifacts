Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than m, m is an integer, k is an integer, aa is a list of at least n strings, bb is a list of strings, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the total count of common elements, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, nabors is greater than 0, stdin is empty. If C[in_aa] is greater than 0, then D[in_aa] is incremented by 1, pairs_in_D is incremented by 1, and C[in_aa] is decremented by 1. If C[in_aa] is 0, then E[in_aa] is incremented by 1. Additionally, if D[out_aa] is greater than 0, then either E[out_aa] is decremented by 1 if it is greater than 0, or D[out_aa] is decremented by 1, C[out_aa] is incremented by 1, and pairs_in_D is decremented by 1 if E[out_aa] is 0. If D[out_aa] is 0, then E[out_aa] is decreased by 1.***
