Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer less than `n`, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of at least `n` strings, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 1 if it was 1 before, 0 if it was 0 before, `nabors` is greater than 2, stdin contains 0 inputs, `in_aa` is the last element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the last element in `aa[:n - m]`. `D` contains all the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the total count of common elements, `E` contains all the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D`, `C` contains all the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 1 if it was 1 before, 0 if it was 0 before, and the value of `fnd` is being printed**
