Output State: **n is an integer greater than m, m is an integer, k is an integer, aa is a list of at least n strings, bb is a list of strings, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the total count of common elements, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, nabors is greater than 0, stdin is empty. The value of D[out_aa] is greater than 0 but 1 less than its original value, the value of C[out_aa] is 1 more than its original value, pairs_in_D is 1 less than its original value.**
