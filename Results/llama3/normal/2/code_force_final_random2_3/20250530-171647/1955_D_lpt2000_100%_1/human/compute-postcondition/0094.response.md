Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer less than n, k is an integer, aa is a list of at least n strings, bb is a list of strings, cnt_aa is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in aa[:m], cnt_bb is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in bb, D is a Counter object containing the common elements between cnt_aa and cnt_bb, pairs_in_D is an integer representing the total count of common elements, E is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_aa that are not in D, C is a Counter object containing the elements in cnt_bb that are not in D, fnd is 1 if pairs_in_D is greater than or equal to k, otherwise 0, nabors is greater than 2, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of strings, in_aa is an element in aa[m:], out_aa is an element in aa[:n - m]. If D[out_aa] > 0, then if E[out_aa] > 0, E[out_aa] is 0. Otherwise, C[out_aa] is greater than 0 and pairs_in_D is less than its original value by 1. If D[out_aa] is 0, then E[out_aa] is decreased by 1. ***
