Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `m + 2`, `m` is an integer incremented by 1, `k` is an integer, `aa` is a list of at least `n` strings, `bb` is a list of strings, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `aa[:m + 2]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the common elements between `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is an integer representing the total count of common elements, `E` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` with `E[out_aa]` decremented by 1, `C` is a Counter object containing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0, `nabors` is greater than 0, stdin is empty, in_aa is the next element in aa[m:], out_aa is the next element in aa[:n - m]**.

In this output state, the value of `E[out_aa]` has been decremented by 1, indicating that the frequency of the string `out_aa` in `E` has decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
