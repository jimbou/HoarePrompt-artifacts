Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers, `stdin` contains `n-2` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, then `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. The last element of `tree` is not equal to the first element of `tree`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
