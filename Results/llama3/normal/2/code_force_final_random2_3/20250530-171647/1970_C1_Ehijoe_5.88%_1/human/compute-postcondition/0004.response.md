Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, t is 1, tree is a deque containing two integers u and v, empty is False, i is 0, u and v are integers, stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, and one integer u_1.**

The code snippet modifies the initial state by appending two integers `u` and `v` to the `tree` deque, which was initially empty. The `empty` variable is then set to `False`, indicating that the `tree` deque is no longer empty. The values of `n`, `t`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The `stdin` still contains `n-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, as the code does not consume any input from `stdin`.
