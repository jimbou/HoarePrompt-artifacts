Reasoning: 
The program is correct. It correctly constructs the tree from the input, determines the starting point, and calculates the minimum number of moves to the beginning and end of the tree. It then correctly prints 'Ron' if the starting point is closer to the beginning or end of the tree by an odd number of moves, and 'Hermione' otherwise. The program's logic is sound and it handles the input correctly.

Correctness: **True**
