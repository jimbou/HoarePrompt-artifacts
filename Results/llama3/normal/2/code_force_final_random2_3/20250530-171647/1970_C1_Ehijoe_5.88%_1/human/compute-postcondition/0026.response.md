Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing at least three elements where the last element is `u`, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `v` is an integer, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is True, then `tree` contains three integers `u`, `v`, and `u`, and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is False, then either `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case `tree` contains at least three elements where the first element is `u`, the second element is `v`, and the last element is `u`, `v` is an integer, and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case either `v` is equal to the last but one element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree` and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case the first element of `tree` is `v` and the last element of `tree` is `u`, or `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, and the last element of `tree` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, or the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the code has appended the value of `u` to the end of the `tree` deque. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of the variables `n`, `t`, `empty`, `i`, and `v` remains the same as in the initial state. The `tree` deque now contains at least three elements, where the last element is `u`. The `stdin` still contains the same number of lines, but the contents of the lines may have changed depending on the values of `u` and `v`.
