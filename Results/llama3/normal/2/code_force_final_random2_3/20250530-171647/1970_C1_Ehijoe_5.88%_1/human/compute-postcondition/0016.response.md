Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an integer equal to the second last element of `tree`, `v` is an integer equal to the last element of `tree`, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. The last element of `tree` is not equal to the first element of `tree`.**

In this output state, the value of `tree` has been updated by appending the value of `v` to it. The value of `v` is now the last element of `tree`. The value of `u` is now the second last element of `tree`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`.
