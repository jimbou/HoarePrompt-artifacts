Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `v` is an integer and equal to the last but one element of `tree`, `u` is an integer and equal to the last element of `tree`, and `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`.**

In this output state, the value of `tree` has been updated by appending the value of `u` to it. The value of `v` is now equal to the last but one element of `tree`, and the value of `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`.
