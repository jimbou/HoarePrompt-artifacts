Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing at least three elements where the first element is `v`, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is True, then `tree` contains three integers `u`, `v`, and the original second element of `tree`, and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is False, then either `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case `tree` contains at least three elements where the first element is `v`, `v` is an integer, and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case either `v` is equal to the last but one element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree` and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case the first element of `tree` is `v` and the last element of `tree` is not `v`, or `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, and the last element of `tree` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, or the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `tree` has been updated by adding `v` to the left of the deque, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `empty` being True or False are still applicable, and the stdin still contains the same number of lines with two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`.
