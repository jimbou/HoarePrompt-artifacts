Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is True, then `tree` contains two integers `u` and `v`, and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is False, then either `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case `tree` contains at least two elements where the first element is `u`, `v` is an integer, and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case either `v` is equal to the last but one element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree` and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case the first element of `tree` is `v` and the last element of `tree` is not `v`, or `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, and the last element of `tree` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, or the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `u` and `v` are updated to the next two integers from the input. The state of the other variables remains the same, but the number of lines in `stdin` is reduced by 1. The conditions for `empty` being True or False and the corresponding states of `tree` and `stdin` are updated accordingly.
