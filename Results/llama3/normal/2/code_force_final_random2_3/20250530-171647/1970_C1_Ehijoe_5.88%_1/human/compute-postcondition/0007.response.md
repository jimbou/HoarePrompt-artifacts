Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing at least two elements where the first element is `u`, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `v` is an integer, `u` is an integer, and `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`.**

In this output state, the value of `tree` has been updated to include the new element `u` at the left end of the deque. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`.
