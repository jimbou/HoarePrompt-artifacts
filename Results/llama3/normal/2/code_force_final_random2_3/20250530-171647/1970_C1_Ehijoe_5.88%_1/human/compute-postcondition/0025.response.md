Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing at least three elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is True, then `tree` contains three integers `u`, `v`, and `u`, and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is False, then either `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case `tree` contains at least three elements where the first element is `u`, `v` is an integer, and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case either `v` is equal to the last but one element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree` and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case the first element of `tree` is `v` and the last element of `tree` is not `v`, or `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, and the last element of `tree` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, or the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `t` is still 1, and `i` is still 1. The `tree` deque now contains at least three elements, with `u` added to the left. The value of `empty` is still False. The values of `u` and `v` are still integers. The `stdin` still contains `n-3` lines of input, each with two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is True, the `tree` contains three integers `u`, `v`, and `u`, and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines of input. If `empty` is False, the state of the variables is updated based on the conditions specified.
