Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least one element, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers, `stdin` contains `n-2` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. The current value of `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`. The current value of `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`. The current value of `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree`.**
