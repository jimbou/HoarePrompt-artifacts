Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque with at least two elements where the first element is `v` and the last element is not `v`, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer and is the first element of `tree`, `stdin` contains `n-2` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`.**

In this output state, the value of `tree` has been updated by adding `v` to the left of the deque, making it the first element. The values of `n`, `t`, `empty`, `i`, `u`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `v` is now the first element of `tree`, and the last element of `tree` is still not equal to `v`.
