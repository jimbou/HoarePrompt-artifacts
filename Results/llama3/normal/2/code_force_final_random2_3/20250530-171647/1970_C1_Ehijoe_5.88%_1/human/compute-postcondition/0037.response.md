Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, t is 1, tree is a deque containing at least four elements, empty is False, i is 2, u and v are integers that were read from the first line of stdin which contains n-4 lines each containing two integers u and v, and one integer u_1.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The value of `t` also remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The `tree` deque now contains at least four elements, as two new elements `u` and `v` were appended to it. The value of `empty` is now False, as it was explicitly set to False in the code. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The values of `u` and `v` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code.
