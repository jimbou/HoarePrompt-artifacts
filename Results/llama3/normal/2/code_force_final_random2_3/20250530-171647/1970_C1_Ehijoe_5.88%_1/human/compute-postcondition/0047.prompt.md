Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, t is 1, tree is an empty deque, empty is True, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and one integer u_1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    if empty:
        tree.append(u)
        tree.append(v)
        empty = False
    elif v == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(u)
    elif v == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(u)
    elif u == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(v)
    elif u == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers, `stdin` contains `n-2` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is True, then `tree` contains two integers `u` and `v`, and `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is False, then either `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case `tree` contains at least two elements where the first element is `u`, `v` is an integer, and `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case either `v` is equal to the last but one element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree` and `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case the first element of `tree` is `v` and the last element of `tree` is not `v`, or `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, and the last element of `tree` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, or the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is True, then `tree` contains two integers `u` and `v`, and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is False, then either `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case `tree` contains at least two elements where the first element is `u`, `v` is an integer, and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case either `v` is equal to the last but one element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree` and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case the first element of `tree` is `v` and the last element of `tree` is not `v`, or `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, and the last element of `tree` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, or the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains at least three elements. If `empty` is True, then `tree` contains three integers `u`, `v`, and another integer, and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is False, then either `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case `tree` contains at least three elements where the first element is `u`, `v` is an integer, and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case either `v` is equal to the last but one element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree` and `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case the first element of `tree` is `v` and the last element of `tree` is not `v`, or `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `stdin` contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, and the last element of `tree` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, or the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains at least three elements where the last element is `u`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers that were read from the first line of `stdin` which contains `n-4` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is True, then `tree` contains at least four elements. If `empty` is False, then either `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, in which case `tree` contains at least three elements where the last element is `u`, or `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`, in which case either `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case `tree` contains at least three elements where the first element is `v`, or `u` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case either `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case `tree` contains at least three elements where the first element is `u`, `v` is an integer, and `stdin` contains `n-5` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case either `v` is equal to the last but one element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree` and `stdin` contains `n-5` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case the first element of `tree` is `v` and the last element of `tree` is not `v`, or `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `stdin` contains `n-5` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, and the last element of `tree` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, or the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains at least three elements where the last element is `v`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
