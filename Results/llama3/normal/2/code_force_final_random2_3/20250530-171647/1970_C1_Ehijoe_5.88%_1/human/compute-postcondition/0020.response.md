Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing at least two elements, `empty` is False, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers, `stdin` contains `n-2` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` contains at least two elements where the first element is `u`, `v` is an integer, and `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, then either `v` is equal to the last but one element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree` and `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case the first element of `tree` is `v` and the last element of `tree` is not `v`, or `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, and the last element of `tree` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, or the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
