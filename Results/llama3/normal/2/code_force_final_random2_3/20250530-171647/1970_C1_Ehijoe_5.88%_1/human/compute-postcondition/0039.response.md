Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing at least three elements where the last element is `u`, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `v` is an integer that was read from the first line of `stdin` which contains `n-5` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is True, then `tree` contains four integers `u`, `v`, another integer, and `u`, and `stdin` contains `n-5` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `empty` is False, then either `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case `tree` contains at least three elements where the first element is `u`, `v` is an integer, and `stdin` contains `n-5` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case either `v` is equal to the last but one element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree` and `stdin` contains `n-5` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, or `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case the first element of `tree` is `v` and the last element of `tree` is not `v`, or `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `stdin` contains `n-5` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`, and the last element of `tree` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, or the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tree` has been updated by appending `u` to it, making it a deque containing at least three elements where the last element is `u`. The values of `n`, `t`, `empty`, `i`, and `v` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged, containing `n-5` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. The conditions for `empty` being True or False and the relationships between `u`, `v`, and the elements of `tree` also remain unchanged.
