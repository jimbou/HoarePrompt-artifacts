Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, constructs a tree from the input, and determines whether a given starting point is closer to the beginning or end of the tree. It then prints 'Ron' if the starting point is closer to the beginning or end of the tree by an odd number of moves, and 'Hermione' otherwise.**
