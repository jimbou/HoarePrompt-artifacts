Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, t is 1, tree is a deque containing at least four elements, empty is False, i is 1, u and v are integers, stdin contains n-4 lines each containing two integers u and v, and one integer u_1.**

The code appends the values of `u` and `v` to the `tree` deque, making it contain at least four elements. The `empty` variable is set to `False`, indicating that the `tree` is not empty. The values of `n`, `t`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged, containing `n-4` lines with two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`.
