Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing at least three elements where the first element is `u`, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `v` is an integer that was read from the first line of `stdin` which contains `n-5` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains at least three elements where the last element is `u`. If `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`, then either `v` is equal to the last but one element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, or `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case the first element of `tree` is `v` and the last element of `tree` is not `v`, or `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree` and the last element of `tree` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, or the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `t` is still 1, and `i` is still 2. The `tree` deque now contains at least three elements, with `u` as the first element. The value of `empty` is still False. The value of `v` is an integer that was read from the first line of `stdin`, which now contains `n-5` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains at least three elements where the last element is `u`. If `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`, then either `v` is equal to the last but one element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, or `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, in which case the first element of `tree` is `v` and the last element of `tree` is not `v`, or `u` is equal to the second last element of `tree`, in which case `v` is equal to the last element of `tree` and the last element of `tree` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, or the state of the variables remains unchanged.
