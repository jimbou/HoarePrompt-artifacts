Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing at least three elements where the first element is `v`, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers that were read from the first line of `stdin` which contains `n-5` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains at least three elements where the last element is `u`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains at least three elements.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `t` is still 1, `tree` now contains at least three elements with `v` as the first element, `empty` is still False, and `i` is still 2. The values of `u` and `v` are still the same, and `stdin` contains `n-5` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`. Additionally, if `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains at least three elements where the last element is `u`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains at least three elements.
