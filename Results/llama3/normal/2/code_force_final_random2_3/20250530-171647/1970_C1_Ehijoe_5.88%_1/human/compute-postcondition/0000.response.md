Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, t is 1, tree is an empty deque, empty is True, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and one integer u_1.**

The first line assigns the values of the first two inputs from stdin to `n` and `t`, respectively. Since `t` is 1, it remains unchanged. The second line creates an empty deque called `tree`. The third line sets the variable `empty` to True. No other variables are affected. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that the first two inputs have been consumed, leaving `n-1` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`.
