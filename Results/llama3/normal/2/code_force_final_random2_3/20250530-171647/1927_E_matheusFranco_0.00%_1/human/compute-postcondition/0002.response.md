Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line calls a function named `func_1()`, but since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine its exact effect on the program state. However, we can infer that it does not modify the value of `t` or the state of stdin, as there is no indication of such changes in the given code.

The second line decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` is initially an integer greater than 0, after the decrement, `t` will be an integer greater than or equal to 0. If `t` was 1 initially, it will become 0 after the decrement.

The state of stdin remains unchanged, as there are no input operations in the code snippet. Therefore, stdin still contains no input.

In summary, the final state of the program is that `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and stdin contains no input.
