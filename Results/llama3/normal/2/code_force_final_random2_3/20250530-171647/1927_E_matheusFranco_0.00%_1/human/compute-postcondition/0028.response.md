Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k <= n, permutation is a list of n zeros with all elements changed to a positive integer, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n + 1, stdin is empty**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the permutation list has been fully populated with positive integers, and the curr_v variable has been incremented to n + 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
