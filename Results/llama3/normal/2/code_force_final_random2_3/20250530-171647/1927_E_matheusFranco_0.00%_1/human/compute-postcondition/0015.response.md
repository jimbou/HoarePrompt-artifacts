Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k > 1 and k <= n, permutation is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than k + 1, permutation[k + 1] is n // k + 3, permutation[2k + 2] is n // k + 4, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 4, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2k + 2, i is 1, stdin is empty**

The code modifies the permutation list by assigning the value of curr_v to the index multiples_of_k_plus_i, which is k + 1. Since curr_v is n // k + 3, permutation[k + 1] becomes n // k + 3. The second line increments curr_v by 1, making it n // k + 4. The third line increments multiples_of_k_plus_i by k, making it 2k + 2. No other variables are affected.
