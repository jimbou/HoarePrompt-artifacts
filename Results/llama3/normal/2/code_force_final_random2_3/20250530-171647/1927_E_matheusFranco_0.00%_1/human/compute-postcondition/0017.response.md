Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k > 1 and k <= n, permutation is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than 2k + 2, permutation[k + 1] is n // k + 3, permutation[2k + 2] is n // k + 4, permutation[2k + 3] is n // k + 4, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 5, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 3k + 2, i is 1, stdin is empty**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The code modifies the permutation list by assigning the value of curr_v to the index multiples_of_k_plus_i, which is 2k + 2. Since curr_v is n // k + 4, this assignment makes permutation[2k + 2] equal to n // k + 4. The second line increments curr_v by 1, making it n // k + 5. The third line increments multiples_of_k_plus_i by k, making it 3k + 2. No other variables are affected.
