Output State: **t is 0, stdin contains no input.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` is 0, and stdin still contains no input. This is because the loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, and in each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` will be 0. The state of stdin remains unchanged throughout the loop, so it still contains no input.
