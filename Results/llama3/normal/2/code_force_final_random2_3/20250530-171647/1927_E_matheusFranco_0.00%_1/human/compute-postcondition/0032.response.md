Functionality: **The function reads two positive integers n and k from standard input, where k is even and less than or equal to n. It then generates a permutation of n positive integers, where the first k elements are assigned values in ascending order, and the remaining elements are assigned values in a cyclic manner. The function prints the resulting permutation as a string of n space-separated positive integers.**
