Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k <= n, permutation is a list of n positive integers, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n + 1, result is a string of n space-separated positive integers, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `result` is a string of n space-separated positive integers, which are the elements of the `permutation` list converted to strings. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty.
