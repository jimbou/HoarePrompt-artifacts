Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k > 2 and k <= n, permutation is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than or equal to k * (n // k), permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i - k] is n // k + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 3 + (len(permutation) - 1) // k, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2 + k, i is 2, stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code modifies the permutation list by assigning the current value of `curr_v` to the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. The value of `curr_v` is then incremented by 1. The index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is also incremented by the value of `k`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The permutation list now has the value `curr_v` at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, and the value `n // k + 1` at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i - k`. The other variables retain their original values.
