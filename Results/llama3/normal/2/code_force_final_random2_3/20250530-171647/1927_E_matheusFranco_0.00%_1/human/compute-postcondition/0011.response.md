Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k > 1 and k <= n, permutation is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than or equal to k * (n // k), permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is n // k + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 2, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 1, i is 1, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being a positive integer, `k` being a positive even integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `permutation` being a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and a length of at least `k * (n // k)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` being `n // k + 1`, `idx` being 0, `idx_v` being 1, `curr_v` being `n // k + 2`, `i` being 1, and `stdin` being empty.
