Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input**

The first line calls the function `func_1()`, but since the function's definition is not provided, we cannot determine its effect on the program state. Therefore, we assume that `func_1()` does not modify any variables.

The second line decrements `t` by 1. Since `t` is initially an integer greater than 0, after decrementing, `t` becomes an integer greater than or equal to 0.

The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, as there is no input operation performed in the code snippet.
