Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation is one where the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes input for a single test case, constructs a k-level permutation, and prints the result. `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

Let's analyze `func_1`:

1. It initializes an array `permutation` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
2. It sets `idx` to 0 and `idx_v` to 1, which will be used to iterate over the permutation array and assign values, respectively.
3. It sets `curr_v` to 1, which will be used to assign values to the permutation array.
4. The outer loop iterates `k` times, and for each iteration, it calculates `multiples_of_k_plus_i` as `i`.
5. The inner while loop assigns values to the permutation array. It starts from `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and increments by `k` each time, ensuring that the values are assigned in a cyclic manner.
6. The `curr_v` value is incremented after each assignment, and the result is printed as a space-separated string.

Now, let's analyze the correctness of the program:

* The program correctly initializes the permutation array and sets up the necessary variables.
* The outer loop iterates `k` times, which is correct since we need to construct a k-level permutation.
* The inner while loop assigns values to the permutation array in a cyclic manner, which ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k will differ by no more than 1.
* The program correctly prints the resulting permutation as a space-separated string.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. In the inner while loop, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` is not sufficient to ensure that the loop terminates correctly. This is because `multiples_of_k_plus_i` can exceed `len(permutation)` when `i` is close to `k`.

To fix this issue, the condition should be changed to `multiples_of_k_plus_i < n`, where `n` is the length of the permutation array.

Corrected code:
```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < n:  # Corrected condition
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
```
With this correction, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
