Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k > 2 and k <= n, permutation is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than 2 + k, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v + 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i - k] is n // k + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 4 + (len(permutation) - 1) // k, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2 + 2k and multiples_of_k_plus_i must be less than len(permutation), i is 2, stdin is empty**

The code executes three lines. The first line assigns the value of `curr_v` to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]`, so `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` becomes `n // k + 3 + (len(permutation) - 1) // k`. The second line increments `curr_v` by 1, making `curr_v` equal to `n // k + 4 + (len(permutation) - 1) // k`. The third line increments `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`, making `multiples_of_k_plus_i` equal to `2 + 2k`. No other variables are affected.
