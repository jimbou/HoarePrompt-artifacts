The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive even integer and `k` > 1 and `k` <= `n`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive even integer and `k` > 2 and `k` <= `n`, `permutation` is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than or equal to `k` * (`n` // `k`), `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `n` // `k` + 1, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n` // `k` + 2 + (`len(permutation)` - 1) // `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is (`len(permutation)` - 1) // `k` * `k` + 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty**
