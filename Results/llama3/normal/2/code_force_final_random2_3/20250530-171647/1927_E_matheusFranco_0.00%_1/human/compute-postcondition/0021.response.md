To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition: `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. The only variables involved in this condition are `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`.

Given the initial states:

- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2
- `permutation` has a length greater than or equal to `k` * (`n` // `k`)

For the loop to execute at least once, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2, we need to ensure that `len(permutation)` is greater than 2.

However, the given condition for `permutation`'s length is already sufficient to guarantee this, as `k` * (`n` // `k`) will always be greater than or equal to 2 given that `k` is a positive even integer greater than 2 and `n` is a positive integer.

Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute the first time, as the conditions provided already ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (being 2) is less than `len(permutation)` (which is greater than or equal to `k` * (`n` // `k`)).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive even integer and `k` > 2 and `k` <= `n`, `permutation` is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than or equal to `k` * (`n` // `k`), `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `n` // `k` + 1, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n` // `k` + 2 + (`len(permutation)` - 1) // `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty**
