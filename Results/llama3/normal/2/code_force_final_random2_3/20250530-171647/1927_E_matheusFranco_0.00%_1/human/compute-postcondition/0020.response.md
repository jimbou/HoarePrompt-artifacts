Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive even integer and `k` > 2 and `k` <= `n`, `permutation` is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than or equal to `k` * (`n` // `k`), `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `n` // `k` + 1, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n` // `k` + 2 + (`len(permutation)` - 1) // `k`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been updated to 2, which is the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
