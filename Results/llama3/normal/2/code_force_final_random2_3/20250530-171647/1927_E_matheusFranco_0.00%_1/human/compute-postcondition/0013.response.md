Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k > 1 and k <= n, permutation is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than or equal to k * (n // k), permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 3, multiples_of_k_plus_i is k + 1, i is 1, stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code modifies the `permutation` list by assigning the value of `curr_v` to the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. The value of `curr_v` is then incremented by 1. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is also incremented by `k`. The other variables, `n`, `k`, `idx`, `idx_v`, and `i`, remain unchanged. The `stdin` remains empty.
