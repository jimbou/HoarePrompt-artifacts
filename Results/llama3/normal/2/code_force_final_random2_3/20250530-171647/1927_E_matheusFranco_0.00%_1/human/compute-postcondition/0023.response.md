The only variable in the loop head is `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`, so we can only adjust those ones.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`. If `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than `len(permutation)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2 + k, `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to k * (n // k). For the loop to be executed one more time, `len(permutation)` needed to have been greater than 2 + k and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` currently must be less than `len(permutation)`.

State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k > 2 and k <= n, permutation is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than 2 + k, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i - k] is n // k + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 3 + (len(permutation) - 1) // k, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2 + k and multiples_of_k_plus_i must be less than len(permutation), i is 2, stdin is empty**
