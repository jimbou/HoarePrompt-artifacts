The only variable in the loop head is variable multiples_of_k_plus_i and len(permutation), so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable multiples_of_k_plus_i and len(permutation).  If multiples_of_k_plus_i is less than len(permutation), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2 + 2k and len(permutation) is greater than 2 + k. So for the loop to be executed one more time, len(permutation) must be greater than 2 + 2k and multiples_of_k_plus_i must be less than len(permutation).
State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k > 2 and k <= n, permutation is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than 2 + 2k, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v + 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i - k] is n // k + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 4 + (len(permutation) - 1) // k, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2 + 2k and multiples_of_k_plus_i must be less than len(permutation), i is 2, stdin is empty**
