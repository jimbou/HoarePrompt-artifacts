Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines: a function call `func_1()` and a decrement operation `t -= 1`. The function call does not provide any information about its effects on the program state, so we cannot determine its impact. However, we can analyze the second line, which decrements the value of `t` by 1.

Since the initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, after the decrement operation, `t` will be either greater than 0 (if it was initially greater than 1) or equal to 0 (if it was initially 1). Therefore, the final state of `t` is greater than or equal to 0.

Note that the stdin is empty, so there is no input to consider. The function call `func_1()` does not provide any information about its effects on the program state, so we cannot determine its impact.
