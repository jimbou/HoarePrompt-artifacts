The variable in the loop head is multiples_of_k_plus_i and len(permutation). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable multiples_of_k_plus_i and len(permutation). If multiples_of_k_plus_i is less than len(permutation), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, multiples_of_k_plus_i is k + 1, len(permutation) is greater than or equal to k * (n // k). len(permutation) being greater than or equal to k * (n // k) does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to len(permutation) is greater than k + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k > 1 and k <= n, permutation is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than k + 1, permutation[k + 1] is curr_v, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 3, multiples_of_k_plus_i is k + 1, i is 1, stdin is empty**
