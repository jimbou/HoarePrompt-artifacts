According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is a positive even integer and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k > 1 and k <= n, permutation is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than or equal to k * (n // k), permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is n // k + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 2, multiples_of_k_plus_i is k * (n // k), i is 1, stdin is empty**
