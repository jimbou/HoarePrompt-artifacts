Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a k-level permutation of length n. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

func_1 reads two positive integers n and k from standard input, where k is even and less than or equal to n. It then generates a permutation of n positive integers, where the first k elements are assigned values in ascending order, and the remaining elements are assigned values in a cyclic manner. The function prints the resulting permutation as a string of n space-separated positive integers.

func_2 reads a positive integer from standard input and executes func_1 a specified number of times equal to the input integer. After execution, the input integer is decremented to 0 and standard input is left empty.

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where a permutation is called k-level if, among all the sums of continuous segments of length k, any two sums differ by no more than 1. The given program achieves this by assigning values in a cyclic manner, ensuring that the sums of continuous segments of length k do not differ by more than 1.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
