Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k > 1 and k <= n, permutation is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than or equal to k * (n // k), permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is n // k + 1, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 2, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 1, i is 1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
    curr_v += 1
    multiples_of_k_plus_i += k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k > 1 and k <= n, permutation is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than or equal to k * (n // k), permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] is curr_v, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 3, multiples_of_k_plus_i is k + 1, i is 1, stdin is empty
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k > 1 and k <= n, permutation is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than k + 1, permutation[k + 1] is n // k + 3, permutation[2k + 2] is n // k + 4, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 4, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 2k + 2, i is 1, stdin is empty
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is a positive integer, k is a positive even integer and k > 1 and k <= n, permutation is a list of more than 0 zeros with the first element changed to 1 and the length of permutation is greater than 2k + 2, permutation[k + 1] is n // k + 3, permutation[2k + 2] is n // k + 4, permutation[2k + 3] is n // k + 4, idx is 0, idx_v is 1, curr_v is n // k + 5, multiples_of_k_plus_i is 3k + 2, i is 1, stdin is empty


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
