Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and stdin now contains one less test case.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(T):
    info = input().split()
    a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
    """for i in range(1,a+1):
        for j in range(4,b+1):
            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:
                print(i,j)"""
    suma = 0
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
        if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
            suma += x
    print(suma - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer, t is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, info is a list of two strings, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, i is b, suma is a positive integer greater than 0, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is a positive integer, t is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, info is a list of two strings, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, i is equal to b, suma is equal to the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) for all i from 1 to b if (a - i * (i - 1)) > 0, otherwise suma is 0, the value of suma - 1 is being printed, and x is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) if (a - i * (i - 1)) > 0, otherwise x is 0, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 2, t is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, info is a list of two integers, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, i is equal to b, and suma is a positive integer between 0 and 2 * 10^6, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
