Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `suma` is equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i), `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i). The current value of (a - i * (i - 1)) is greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `suma` has been updated to be equal to `x`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, and is equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
