Output State: **T is a positive integer, t is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, info is a list of two strings, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, i is b, suma is a positive integer greater than 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` is equal to `b`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `suma` is a positive integer greater than 0, indicating that the loop has successfully executed at least once and the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0` was true at least once. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
