To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `t` and the integer `T`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is a positive integer, which means it is already at least 1, so we don't need to adjust it. However, we do need to adjust the state of `t` to reflect that it will start at 0.

State: **`T` is a positive integer, `t` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and stdin now contains one less test case.**
