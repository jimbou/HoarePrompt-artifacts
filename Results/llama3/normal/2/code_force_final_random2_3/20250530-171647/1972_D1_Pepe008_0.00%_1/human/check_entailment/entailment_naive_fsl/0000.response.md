Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the line where the variable `x` is calculated. The formula used to calculate `x` is incorrect and does not accurately represent the number of valid pairs for each value of `i`.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b`, and checking if the condition `a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b)` is satisfied. The program does not do this correctly, and therefore, it is incorrect.

For example, if we take the input `n = 3` and `m = 5`, the program will output `4`, but the correct output should be `4` because the valid pairs are `(1,1), (1,5), (2,2), (3,3)`. However, if we take the input `n = 10` and `m = 8`, the program will output `13`, but the correct output should be `14` because the valid pairs are `(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not satisfy the problem description for every potential case.
