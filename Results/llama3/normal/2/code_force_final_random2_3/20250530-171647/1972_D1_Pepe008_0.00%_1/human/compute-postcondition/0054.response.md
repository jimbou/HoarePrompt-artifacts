Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 2, t is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, info is a list of two integers, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, i is equal to b, and suma is a positive integer between 0 and 2 * 10^6.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for T, t, stdin, and info as in the initial state. The value of a will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The value of i will be equal to b, as the loop iterates from 1 to b (inclusive). The value of suma will be a positive integer between 0 and 2 * 10^6, as it accumulates the values of x in each iteration, and x is calculated based on the values of a and i.
