Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a positive integer between 0 and 2 * 10^6 // 9 + 1. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `suma` is increased by a positive integer between 0 and 2 * 10^6 // 9 + 1.***
