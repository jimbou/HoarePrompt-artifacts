Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `info` is a list of two strings, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `suma` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, otherwise `suma` is 0, and `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`.***
