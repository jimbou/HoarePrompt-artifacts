Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `info` is a list of two strings, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `i` is 1, `suma` is equal to (a - i * (i - 1)) // i, the value of `suma` - 1 is being printed, and `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to (a - i * (i - 1)) // i.**

In this output state, the value of `suma` has been updated to include the value of `x`, which is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `suma` - 1 is still being printed.
