According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `b`, so `i` must be at least 1. Also, the range starts from 1, so `i` must be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **T is a positive integer, t is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, info is a list of two strings, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, i is 1, suma is 0, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed**
