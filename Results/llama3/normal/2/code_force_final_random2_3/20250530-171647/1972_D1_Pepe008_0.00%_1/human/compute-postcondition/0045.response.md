Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, then `suma` is equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) and `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i).***
