Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer, t is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, info is a list of two strings, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, i is b, suma is 0, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
    if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
        suma += x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is a positive integer, t is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, info is a list of two strings, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, i is 1, suma is equal to (a - i * (i - 1)) // i if a - i * (i - 1) > 0, otherwise suma is 0, the value of suma - 1 is being printed, and x is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to (a - i * (i - 1)) // i

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is a positive integer, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `info` is a list of two strings, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `suma` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, otherwise `suma` is 0, and `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is a positive integer, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `info` is a list of two strings, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `suma` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, otherwise `suma` is 0, and `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, the value of `suma` has been updated by adding the value of `x` to it. Otherwise, the value of `suma` remains unchanged. All other variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
