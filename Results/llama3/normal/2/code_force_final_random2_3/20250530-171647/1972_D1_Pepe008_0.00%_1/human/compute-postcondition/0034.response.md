Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `info` is a list of two strings, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `suma` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, otherwise `suma` is 0, and `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `suma` has been updated by adding the value of `x` to it. The value of `suma` is now the sum of its previous value and `x`, which is `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, otherwise it remains 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
