Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `info` is a list of two strings, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `suma` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, otherwise `suma` is 0, and `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2) + 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` has been updated to be one more than the integer division of `a` minus `i` times `i-1` by the square of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
