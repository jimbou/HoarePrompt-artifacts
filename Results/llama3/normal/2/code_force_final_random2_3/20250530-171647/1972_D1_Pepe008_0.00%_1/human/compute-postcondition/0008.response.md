To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, b + 1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The state of `b` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables (`T`, `t`, `stdin`, `info`, `a`, `x`, and `suma`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`T` is a positive integer, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `info` is a list of two strings, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `i` is 2. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, then `suma` is a positive integer greater than 0. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**
