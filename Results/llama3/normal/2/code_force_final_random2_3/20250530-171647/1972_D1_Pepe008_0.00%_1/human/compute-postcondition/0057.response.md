Output State: **T is a positive integer, t is equal to T, stdin contains no test cases, info is a list of two strings, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, i is equal to b, suma is a positive integer between 0 and 2 * 10^6, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed.**

This output state means that the loop has executed T times, and all test cases have been processed. The variables a, b, i, and suma have the same values as after the third iteration, but t is now equal to T, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The stdin no longer contains any test cases, as they have all been processed.
