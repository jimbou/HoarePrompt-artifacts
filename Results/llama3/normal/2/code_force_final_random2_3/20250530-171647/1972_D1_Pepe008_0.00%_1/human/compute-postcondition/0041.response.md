To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `b`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `b` is at least 1.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `suma` is 0, and `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) if (a - i * (i - 1)) > 0, otherwise x is 0, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed**
