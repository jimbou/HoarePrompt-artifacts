Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `info` is a list of two strings, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `suma` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, otherwise `suma` is 0, and `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` has been updated to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1)`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is now a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, and its value depends on the values of `a` and `i`. The other variables retain their initial values and properties.
