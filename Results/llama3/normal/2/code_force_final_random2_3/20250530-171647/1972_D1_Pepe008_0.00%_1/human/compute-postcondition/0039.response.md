The only variable in the loop head is variable `t` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1, `T` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `t` is increased by 1 so `t` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 2.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, info is a list of two strings, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, i is equal to b, suma is equal to the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) for all i from 1 to b if (a - i * (i - 1)) > 0, otherwise suma is 0, the value of suma - 1 is being printed, and x is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) if (a - i * (i - 1)) > 0, otherwise x is 0, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed**
