Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1) if (a - i * (i - 1)) > 0, otherwise x is 1, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1) if (a - i * (i - 1)) > 0, otherwise x is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `suma` - 1 is still being printed.
