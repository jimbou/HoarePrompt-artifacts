To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `b`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `b` is at least 1.

State: **T is a positive integer, t is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, info is a list of two strings, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, suma is 0, i is 1**
