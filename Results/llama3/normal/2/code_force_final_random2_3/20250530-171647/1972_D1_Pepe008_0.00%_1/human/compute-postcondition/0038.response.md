Output: **T is a positive integer, t is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, info is a list of two strings, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, i is equal to b, suma is equal to the sum of ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) for all i from 1 to b if (a - i * (i - 1)) > 0, otherwise suma is 0, the value of suma - 1 is being printed, and x is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) if (a - i * (i - 1)) > 0, otherwise x is 0, and the value of suma - 1 is being printed**
