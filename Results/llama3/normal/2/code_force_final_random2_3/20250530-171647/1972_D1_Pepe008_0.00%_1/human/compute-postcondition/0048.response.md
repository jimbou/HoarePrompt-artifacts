Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `suma` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i), `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)**

The value of `suma` is updated by adding the value of `x` to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `suma` is twice the value of `x`, which is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i).
