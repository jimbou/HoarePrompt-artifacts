Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `info` is a list of two strings, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer between 3 and 2 * 10^6, `x` is either ((a - 6) // 9 + 1) or ((a - 2) // 4 + 1), `i` is 3. If `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) > 0` and `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `suma` is a positive integer greater than 0 and increased by either ((a - 6) // 9 + 1) or ((a - 2) // 4 + 1). Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
