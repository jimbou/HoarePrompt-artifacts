Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and stdin now contains one less test case.**

In this output state, `T` is assigned the value of the first test case from the input, which is a positive integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before, since the first test case has been read and assigned to `T`. The remaining test cases still contain two positive integers n and m, within the given range.
