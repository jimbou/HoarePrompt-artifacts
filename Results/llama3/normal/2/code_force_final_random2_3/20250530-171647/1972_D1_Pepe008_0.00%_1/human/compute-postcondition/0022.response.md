Output State: **T is a positive integer, t is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, info is a list of two strings, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, i is 1, suma is 0, the value of suma - 1 is being printed, and x is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 which is (a - 0) // 1 + 1 = a + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still a positive integer, t is still 1, there are still multiple test cases minus three in stdin, info is still a list of two strings, a and b are still positive integers between 1 and 2 * 10^6, i is still 1, suma is still 0, the value of suma - 1 is still being printed, and x is now a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to a + 1.
