Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `suma` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i), `x` is ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1).**

In natural language, the output state is: T is a positive integer greater than 2, t is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, info is a list of two integers, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, b must be greater than 1, i is 2, suma is equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) and x is equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1).
