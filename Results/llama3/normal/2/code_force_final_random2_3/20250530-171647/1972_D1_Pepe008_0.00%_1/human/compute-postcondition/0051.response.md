Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `info` is a list of two integers, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `x` is a positive integer between 0 and 2 * 10^6 // 9 + 1**

In natural language, the output state is: T is a positive integer greater than 2, t is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, info is a list of two integers, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, b must be greater than 3, i is 3, and x is a positive integer between 0 and 2 * 10^6 // 9 + 1.
