Output State: **T is a positive integer, t is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, info is a list of two strings, a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, b is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, suma is 0, i is 1, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6**.

In this output state, the value of x is calculated based on the values of a and i. Since a is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, and i is 1, the expression (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 simplifies to (a - 0) // 1 + 1, which is equal to a + 1. Therefore, x is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
