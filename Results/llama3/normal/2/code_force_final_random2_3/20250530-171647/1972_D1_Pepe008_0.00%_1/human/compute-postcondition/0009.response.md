Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `info` is a list of two strings, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `x` is either 1 or ((a - 2) // 4 + 1), `i` is 2. If `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) > 0`, then `suma` is a positive integer greater than 0. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `x` has been updated based on the value of `a` and `i`. If `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) > 0`, then `x` is now equal to `((a - 2) // 4 + 1)`, otherwise, it is equal to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
