The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `b` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `b` must be greater than 3.
State: **`T` is a positive integer, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `info` is a list of two strings, `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, `b` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `suma` is equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, otherwise `suma` is 0, and `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^6, equal to `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`**
