#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        
        num = n - list0[-1]
        
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        
        print(count + x - 2)
        
    #State: T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than or equal to 0, _ is T, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 0 test cases, i is x - 1, count is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus x if n is equal to list0[-1] + 1, otherwise count is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus x - 1, and this is printed: count + x - 2

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is the total number of elements, x is the number of elements in the list, and y is always 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function then sorts the list of integers and counts the number of pairs of consecutive elements that have a difference of 2. If the last element in the list is equal to n-1, it adds x to the count; otherwise, it adds x-1. Finally, it prints the count plus x minus 2 for each test case.
