The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 2.
State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains `T - 4` test cases, `i` is 1, `num` is `list0[1] - list0[0] - 1**
