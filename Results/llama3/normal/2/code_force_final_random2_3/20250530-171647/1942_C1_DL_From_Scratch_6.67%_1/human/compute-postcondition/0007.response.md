Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains `T - 1` test cases, `i` is 0. If `num` is equal to 1, which is equal to `list0[1] - list0[0] - 1`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
