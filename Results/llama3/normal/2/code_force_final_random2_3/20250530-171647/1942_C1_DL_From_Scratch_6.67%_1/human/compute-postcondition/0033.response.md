Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer that is greater than 2, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is 1, count is 1 if the difference between the second and first elements of list0 is 2, otherwise count is 0, num is the difference between the third and second elements of list0 minus 1. If num is 1, then stdin contains T - 4 test cases, i is 1, count is 2 if the difference between the second and first elements of list0 is 2, otherwise count is 1, num is the difference between the third and second elements of list0 minus 1.***
