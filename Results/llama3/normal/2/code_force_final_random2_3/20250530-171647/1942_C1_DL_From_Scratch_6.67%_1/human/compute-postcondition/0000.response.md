Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable T is assigned the value of the first input integer, which is between 1 and 10^4. The remaining input in the stdin still contains t test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y, where n is between 4 and 10^9, x is between 2 and the minimum of n and 2 * 10^5, and y is 0. The second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
