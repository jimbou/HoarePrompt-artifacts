Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is x - 1, count is 0**

The code block reads two lines of input from stdin, assigning the values to `n`, `x`, and `y`. The first line of input is split into three integers, which are assigned to `n`, `x`, and `y`, respectively. The second line of input is split into a list of integers, which is assigned to `list0`. The list is then sorted in ascending order. A new variable `count` is initialized to 0. The values of `T`, `_`, `i`, and the relationship between `num`, `n`, and `count` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2.
