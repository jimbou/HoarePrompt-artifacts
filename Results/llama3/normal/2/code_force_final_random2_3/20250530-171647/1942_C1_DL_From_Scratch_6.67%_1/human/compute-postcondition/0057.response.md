Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains `T - 4` test cases, `i` is 2, `num` is `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1`, which is the difference between the third and second elements of the sorted list `list0`, minus 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
