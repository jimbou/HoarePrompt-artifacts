Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is x - 1, count is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus 1, and the current value of num is 1, which means n is equal to list0[-1] + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is an integer between 1 and 10^4 and is greater than 0. The variable _ is 1. The variables n, x, and y are integers. The list0 is a sorted list of integers. There are T - 3 test cases left in the stdin. The variable i is equal to x - 1. The variable count is increased by 1, so it is now the number of pairs of consecutive elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus 1. The current value of num is 1, which means n is equal to list0[-1] + 1.
