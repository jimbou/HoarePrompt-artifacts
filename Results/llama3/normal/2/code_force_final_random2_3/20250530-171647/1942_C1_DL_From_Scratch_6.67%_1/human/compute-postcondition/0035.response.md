Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer that is greater than 3, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is 2, count is 1 if the difference between the second and first elements of list0 is 2, otherwise count is 0, num is the difference between the fourth and third elements of list0 minus 1. If num is 1, then stdin contains T - 4 test cases, i is 1, count is 2 if the difference between the second and first elements of list0 is 2, otherwise count is 1, num is the difference between the fourth and third elements of list0 minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of num has been updated to be the difference between the fourth and third elements of list0 minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of num is now dependent on the values of the third and fourth elements of list0. If num is 1, then the number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, and the value of i and count are updated accordingly.
