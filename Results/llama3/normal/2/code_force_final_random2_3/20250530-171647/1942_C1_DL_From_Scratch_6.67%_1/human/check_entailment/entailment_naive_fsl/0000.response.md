Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. The program first sorts the list of chosen vertices and then iterates through the list to count the number of triangular pieces that can be formed. The program also correctly handles the case where the last vertex is not included in the count.

The program's logic is as follows:

1. Sort the list of chosen vertices.
2. Iterate through the list and count the number of triangular pieces that can be formed by subtracting 1 from the difference between each pair of adjacent vertices.
3. Add the count of triangular pieces formed by the last vertex (if it is not included in the previous count).
4. Add the number of chosen vertices minus 2 to the total count (because each chosen vertex can form a triangle with the two adjacent vertices).

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the last vertex is not included in the count, and the case where the number of chosen vertices is equal to the number of sides of the polygon.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
