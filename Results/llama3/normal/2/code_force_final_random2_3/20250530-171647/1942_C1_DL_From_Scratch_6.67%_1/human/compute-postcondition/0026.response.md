Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer that is greater than 1, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is 0, count is 0, num is list0[1] - list0[0] - 1**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 and is greater than 0. The value of _ is still 1. The value of n is still an integer. The value of x is still an integer greater than 1. The value of y is still an integer. list0 is still a sorted list of integers. There are still T - 3 test cases in stdin. The value of i is still 0. The value of count is still 0. A new variable num is introduced, which is equal to the difference between the second element of list0 and the first element of list0 minus 1.
