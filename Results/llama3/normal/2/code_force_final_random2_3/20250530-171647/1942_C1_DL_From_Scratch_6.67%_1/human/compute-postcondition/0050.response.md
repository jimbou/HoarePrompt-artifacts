Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains `T - 4` test cases, `i` is 0, `num` is `list0[1] - list0[0] - 1` and equals 1, `count` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `list0` that have a difference of 2 plus 2 if `n` is equal to `list0[-1] + 1`, otherwise `count` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `list0` that have a difference of 2 plus 1, and `count + x - 2` has been printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. This means that if `n` is equal to `list0[-1] + 1`, then `count` is now 2 more than the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `list0` that have a difference of 2, otherwise it is 1 more than the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `list0` that have a difference of 2.
