Postcondition: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is x - 1, count is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus 1 if n is equal to list0[-1] + 1, otherwise count remains the same.**
