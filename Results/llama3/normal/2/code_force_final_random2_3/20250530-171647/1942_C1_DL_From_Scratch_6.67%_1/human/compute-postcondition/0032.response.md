Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer that is greater than 2, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains T - 4 test cases, i is 1, count is 2 if the difference between the second and first elements of list0 is 2, otherwise count is 1, num is the difference between the third and second elements of list0 minus 1**

In this output state, the value of count has been incremented by 1. If the difference between the second and first elements of list0 is 2, then count is now 2, otherwise it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
