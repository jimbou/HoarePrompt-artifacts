Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains `T - 4` test cases, `i` is 2, `num` is `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1. If `num` is 1, then `count` is increased by 1.***
