Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains T - 4 test cases, i is x - 1, count is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus 1 if n is equal to list0[-1] + 1, otherwise count remains the same, and this is printed: count + x - 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x - 1):
    num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
    if num == 1:
        count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains `T - 4` test cases, `i` is 0, `num` is `list0[1] - list0[0] - 1`. If `num` equals 1, `count` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `list0` that have a difference of 2 plus 2 if `n` is equal to `list0[-1] + 1`, otherwise `count` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `list0` that have a difference of 2 plus 1. Otherwise, `count` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `list0` that have a difference of 2 plus 1 if `n` is equal to `list0[-1] + 1`, otherwise `count` remains the same. In all cases, `count + x - 2` has been printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 2, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains T - 4 test cases, i is 1, num is list0[2] - list0[1] - 1. If num is equal to 1, count is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains `T - 4` test cases, `i` is 2, `num` is `list0[3] - list0[2] - 1. If `num` is 1, then `count` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
