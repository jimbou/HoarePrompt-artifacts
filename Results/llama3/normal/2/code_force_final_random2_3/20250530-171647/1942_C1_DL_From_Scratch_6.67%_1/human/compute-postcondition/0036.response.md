Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer that is greater than 3, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is 2, count is 2 if the difference between the second and first elements of list0 is 2, otherwise count is 1, num is the difference between the fourth and third elements of list0 minus 1. If num is 1, then stdin contains T - 4 test cases, i is 1, count is 3 if the difference between the second and first elements of list0 is 2, otherwise count is 2, num is the difference between the fourth and third elements of list0 minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of count has been incremented by 1. If the difference between the second and first elements of list0 is 2, then count is now 2, otherwise it is 1. If num is 1, then count is now 3 if the difference between the second and first elements of list0 is 2, otherwise it is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
