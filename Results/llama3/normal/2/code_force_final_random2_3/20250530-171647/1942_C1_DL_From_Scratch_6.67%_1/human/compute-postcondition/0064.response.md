Postcondition: ***T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains T - 4 test cases, i is x - 1, if num is equal to 1, count is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus x if n is equal to list0[-1] + 1, otherwise count is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus x - 1. If num is not equal to 1, count remains the same as before***
