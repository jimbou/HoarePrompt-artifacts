Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer that is greater than 2, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains T - 3 test cases, i is 1, count is 1 if the difference between the second and first elements of list0 is 2, otherwise count is 0, num is the difference between the third and second elements of list0 minus 1**

In this output state, the value of `num` is calculated as the difference between the third and second elements of `list0` minus 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains T - 3 test cases.
