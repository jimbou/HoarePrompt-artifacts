Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer that is greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains `T - 3` test cases, `i` is 0, `count` is 1, and the current value of `num` is 1, which is equal to `list0[1] - list0[0] - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of count has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of T is still between 1 and 10^4 and greater than 0. The value of _ is still 1. The value of n is still an integer. The value of x is still greater than 1. The value of y is still an integer. The list0 is still a sorted list of integers. There are still T - 3 test cases in stdin. The value of i is still 0. The value of num is still equal to list0[1] - list0[0] - 1 and is still 1.
