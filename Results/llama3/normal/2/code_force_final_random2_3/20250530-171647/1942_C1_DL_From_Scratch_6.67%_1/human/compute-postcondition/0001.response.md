The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases, `T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
