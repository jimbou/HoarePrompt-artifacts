Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is the total number of elements, x is the number of elements in the list, and y is always 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function then sorts the list of integers and counts the number of pairs of consecutive elements that have a difference of 2. If the last element in the list is equal to n-1, it adds x to the count; otherwise, it adds x-1. Finally, it prints the count plus x minus 2 for each test case.**
