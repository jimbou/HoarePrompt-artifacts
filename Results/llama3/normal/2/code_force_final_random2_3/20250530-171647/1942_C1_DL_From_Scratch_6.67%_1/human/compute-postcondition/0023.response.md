State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains T - 2 test cases, i is x - 1, if num is 1 then n is equal to list0[-1] + 1 and count is increased by 1, and this is printed: count + x - 2, where count is the number of times num is 1 and x is an integer**
