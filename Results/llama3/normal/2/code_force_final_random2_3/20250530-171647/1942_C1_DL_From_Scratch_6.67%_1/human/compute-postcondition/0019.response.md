Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains `T - 2` test cases, `i` is `x - 1`, `num` is 1, `n` is equal to `list0[-1] + 1`, and `count` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of count has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1. The value of n is still equal to the last element of list0 plus 1.
