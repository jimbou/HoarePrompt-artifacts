Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains `T - 4` test cases, `i` is 1, `num` is `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1, count` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains `T - 4` test cases, `i` is 1, `num` is `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1` is still valid after the code has been executed.
