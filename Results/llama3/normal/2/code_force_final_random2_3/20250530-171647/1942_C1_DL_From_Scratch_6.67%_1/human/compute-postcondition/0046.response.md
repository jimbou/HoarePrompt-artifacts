Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is greater than 1, _ is 2, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, list0 is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains T - 4 test cases, i is x - 1, count is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus 1 if n is equal to list0[-1] + 1, otherwise count remains the same, and this is printed: count + x - 2.**

In this output state, the values of T, _, i, and the relation between T and 1 remain the same as in the initial state. The values of n, x, and y are updated to the values read from stdin. The list0 is updated to a sorted list of integers read from stdin. Stdin now contains T - 4 test cases. The count is updated to the number of pairs of consecutive elements in list0 that have a difference of 2 plus 1 if n is equal to list0[-1] + 1, otherwise count remains the same. The expression count + x - 2 is printed.
