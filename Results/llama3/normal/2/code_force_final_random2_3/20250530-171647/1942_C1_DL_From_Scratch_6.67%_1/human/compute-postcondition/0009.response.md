Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains `T - 1` test cases, `i` is 1, `num` is `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1`**

In this output state, the value of `num` is calculated by subtracting the second element of `list0` from the third element of `list0` and then subtracting 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
