Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16`, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` is at least 4**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the additional term `(n + 4) // 16`, which is calculated by adding `n` and `b` (which is 4), then dividing the result by the square of `b` (which is 16). The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `T`, `n`, `m`, and `min(n, m)` are still valid.
