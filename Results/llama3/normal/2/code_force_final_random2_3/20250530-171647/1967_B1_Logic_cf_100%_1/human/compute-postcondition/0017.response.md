Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` is at least 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)`, where `b` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now a combination of its original value `n + (n + 2) // 4` and the additional term `(n + 3) // 9`.
