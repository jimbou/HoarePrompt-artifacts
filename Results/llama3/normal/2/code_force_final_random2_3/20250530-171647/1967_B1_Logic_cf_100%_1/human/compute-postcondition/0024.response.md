Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, T is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is equal to n, b is equal to min(n, m) + 1, min(n, m) is at least 2**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to n and m. It then resets ans to be equal to n. The value of b remains unchanged as min(n, m) + 1, and the constraint that min(n, m) is at least 2 still holds. The values of t and T are not affected by the code. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three.
