Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, T is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is equal to n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16 + ... + (n + min(n, m)) // (min(n, m) * min(n, m)), b is equal to min(n, m) + 1, and min(n, m) is at least 2.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables `ans` and `b`. The variable `ans` is now equal to the sum of the initial value of `n` and the sum of the terms `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`. The variable `b` is now equal to `min(n, m) + 1`. The other variables `t`, `T`, `stdin`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
