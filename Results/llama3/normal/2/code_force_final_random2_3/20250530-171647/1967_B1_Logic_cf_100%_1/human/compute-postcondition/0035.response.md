Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. It calculates a value 'ans' for each test case, which is initially set to n, and then iteratively adds the result of the expression (n + b) // (b * b) for b ranging from 2 to the minimum of n and m. Finally, it prints the calculated 'ans' value for each test case.**
