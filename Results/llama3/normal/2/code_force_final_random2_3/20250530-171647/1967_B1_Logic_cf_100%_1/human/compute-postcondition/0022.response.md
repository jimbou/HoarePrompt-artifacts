Output: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, T is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is equal to n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)), b is equal to min(n, m) + 1, min(n, m) is at least 2, and the value of ans which is n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)) is being printed**
