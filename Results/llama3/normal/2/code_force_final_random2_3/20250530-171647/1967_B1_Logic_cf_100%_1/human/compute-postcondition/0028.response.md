Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `b` is 3, and `min(n, m)` is at least 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the additional term `(n + 3) // 9`, which is calculated by adding `n` and `b` (which is 3), then dividing the result by `b` squared (which is 9). The other variables remain unchanged.
