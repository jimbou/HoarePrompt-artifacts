To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):`. The objects involved are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes 4.

The loop condition is `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `min(n, m) + 1` must be greater than or equal to 4. Since `n` and `m` are both positive integers greater than or equal to 3, `min(n, m) + 1` is at least 4.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `b` is 4
* `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3
* `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3

The other variables `t`, `T`, `stdin`, and `ans` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `b` is 4**
