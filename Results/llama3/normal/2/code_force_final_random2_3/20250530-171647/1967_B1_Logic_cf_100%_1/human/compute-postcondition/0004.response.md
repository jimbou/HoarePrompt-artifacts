Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, `b` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, which is the result of adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to the original value of `ans`, which was `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
