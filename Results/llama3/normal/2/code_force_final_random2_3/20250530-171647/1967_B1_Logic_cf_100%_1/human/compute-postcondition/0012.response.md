The only variable in the loop head is T and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T and t. If T is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is 0, t is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again T is increased by 1 so T is 1 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, T is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, ans is equal to n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)), b is min(n, m) + 1, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the sum of n and the sum of (n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))**
