Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` is at least 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, which is the result of adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to the original value of `ans`, which was equal to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
