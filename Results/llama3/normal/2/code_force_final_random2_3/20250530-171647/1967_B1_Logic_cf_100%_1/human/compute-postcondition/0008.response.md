Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16`, `b` is 4**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its previous value. Since `b` is 4, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` simplifies to `(n + 4) // 16`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
