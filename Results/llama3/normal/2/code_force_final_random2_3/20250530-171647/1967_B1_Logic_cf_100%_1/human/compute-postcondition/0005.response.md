The only variables in the loop head are variables  b, n and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `b`, `n` and `m`. If `b` is less than the minimum of `n` and `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be increased by 1, so `b` is 3, and the minimum of `n` and `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, `b` is 3**
