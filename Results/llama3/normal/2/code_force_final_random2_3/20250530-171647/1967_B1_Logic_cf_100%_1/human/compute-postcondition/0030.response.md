Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16`, `b` is 4, and `min(n, m)` is at least 4**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its previous value. Since `b` is 4, this expression simplifies to `(n + 4) // 16`. The other variables remain unchanged.
