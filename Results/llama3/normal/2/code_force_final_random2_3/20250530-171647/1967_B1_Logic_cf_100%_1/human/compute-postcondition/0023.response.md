The only variable in the loop head is variable T, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T and t. If T is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is 1, t is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again T must be increased by 1 so T is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 2.
State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, T is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is equal to n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)), b is equal to min(n, m) + 1, min(n, m) is at least 2**
