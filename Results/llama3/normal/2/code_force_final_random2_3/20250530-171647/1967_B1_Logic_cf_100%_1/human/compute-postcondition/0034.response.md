Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, T is equal to t, stdin contains no test cases, n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is equal to n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)), b is equal to min(n, m) + 1, and the value of ans which is n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)) is being printed**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` is still a positive integer but its value is now greater than or equal to 0 (since it could be 0 if there were no test cases), `T` is equal to `t` (since the loop has executed `t` times), there are no more test cases in `stdin`, `n` and `m` are still integers (but their values are not specified), `ans` is still equal to the sum of `n` and the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for `b` in range 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`, `b` is still equal to `min(n, m) + 1`, and the value of `ans` is being printed.
