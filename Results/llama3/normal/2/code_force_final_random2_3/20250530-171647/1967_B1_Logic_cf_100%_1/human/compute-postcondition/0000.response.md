The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input to `t`, where `input()` accepts the first line of the input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, a positive integer. After reading the first line, the remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `m`.**
