Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `b` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the additional term `(n + 3) // 9`, which is the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` where `b` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
