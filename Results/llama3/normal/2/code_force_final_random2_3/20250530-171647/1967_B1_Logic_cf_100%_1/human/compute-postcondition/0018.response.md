To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):`. The objects involved are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` is at least 3, and the other variables have their respective values.

For the loop to execute again, `b` must be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes 4. Additionally, `min(n, m)` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue.

The other variables, `t`, `T`, `stdin`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, are not affected by the loop head and remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` is at least 4**
