According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `b`, `n`, and `m`. If `min(n, m)` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `b` is not defined, and `min(n, m)` is not guaranteed to be at least 2. So, we need to adjust the states to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n`, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` is at least 2**
