Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, T is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is equal to n, b is min(n, m) + 1, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the sum of n and the sum of (n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `T`, `b`, and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The value of `n` and `m` are updated to the integer values obtained from the input. The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `n`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two because two inputs have been read.
