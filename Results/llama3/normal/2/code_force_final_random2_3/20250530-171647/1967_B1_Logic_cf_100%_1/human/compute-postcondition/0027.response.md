To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` is at least 2, and `n` and `m` are integers.

For the loop to execute again, `b` must be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes 3. Additionally, `min(n, m)` must be at least 3, because `b` is now 3 and the loop condition is `b` < `min(n, m) + 1`.

The other variables, `t`, `T`, `stdin`, `ans`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, `b` is 3, and `min(n, m)` is at least 3**
