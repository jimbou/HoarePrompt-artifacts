Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, T is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, ans is equal to n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)), b is min(n, m) + 1**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the values of `t`, `T`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `n` and `m` are still positive integers, but their exact values are not specified. The value of `ans` is the sum of the initial value of `n` and the sum of the expressions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all values of `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m` (inclusive). The value of `b` is one more than the minimum of `n` and `m`.
