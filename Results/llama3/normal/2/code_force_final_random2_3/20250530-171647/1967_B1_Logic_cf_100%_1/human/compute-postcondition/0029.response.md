To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):`. The objects involved are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` is at least 3, and the other variables have their respective values.

For the loop to execute again, `b` must be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes 4. The condition `min(n, m) >= b` must still hold true for the loop to continue. Since `b` is now 4, `min(n, m)` must be at least 4.

The other variables, `t`, `T`, `stdin`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9`, `b` is 4, and `min(n, m)` is at least 4**
