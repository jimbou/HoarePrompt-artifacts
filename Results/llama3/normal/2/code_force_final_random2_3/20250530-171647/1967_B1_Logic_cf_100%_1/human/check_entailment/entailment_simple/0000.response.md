Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating over all possible values of b from 2 to the minimum of n and m, and for each b, it adds the number of valid pairs (a, b) to the answer.

However, the program has a logical error. The condition a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b) is not being checked correctly. The program is simply adding (n + b) // (b * b) to the answer, which is not the correct way to count the number of valid pairs.

The correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of a and b, and for each pair (a, b), check if a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b). If it is, then increment the answer.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
