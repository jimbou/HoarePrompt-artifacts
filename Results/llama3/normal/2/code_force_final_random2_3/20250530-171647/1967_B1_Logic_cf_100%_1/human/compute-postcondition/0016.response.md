The only objects in the loop head are variables  b, n and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `b`, `n` and `m`. If `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be increased by 1, so `b` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `min(n, m)` must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + 2) // 4`, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` is at least 3**
