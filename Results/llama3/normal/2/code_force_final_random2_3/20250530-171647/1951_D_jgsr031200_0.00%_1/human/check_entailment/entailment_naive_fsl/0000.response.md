Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when n = 10 and k = 3, the program prints "YES" and the costs [8, 1], but this is not a valid solution because Alice will buy 1 jewel at the first stall and be left with 2 coins, which is not enough to buy any jewels at the second stall.

The issue with the program is that it only considers two stalls with costs n - k + 1 and 1, but it does not consider the case where Alice may not be able to buy any jewels at the second stall. The program should consider more stalls or a different approach to solve the problem.

Here is a counterexample:

Input:
10 3

Output:
YES
2
8 1

But the correct output should be "NO" because it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly 3 jewels.
