Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program takes two positive integers n and k as input, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

The program first checks if n is equal to k. If they are equal, it prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

If n is less than k, the program prints "NO" because it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly k jewels with less than k coins.

If n is greater than or equal to k, the program calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall by dividing n by the price of each stall. It then checks if the total number of jewels Alice can buy is less than k. If it is, the program prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices n-k+1 and 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
