Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is 0**

The code snippet initializes a list called `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers and `n` is larger than or equal to `k`, the value of `n - k + 1` will be a positive integer. The variable `h` is initialized to `0`. The initial state of `n` and `k` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
