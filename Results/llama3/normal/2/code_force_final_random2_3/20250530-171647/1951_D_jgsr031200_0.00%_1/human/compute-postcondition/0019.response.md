To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in costs:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `i` and `costs`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second element in the list `costs`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be the next element in the list `costs`. Since `costs` has at least 2 elements, we can assume it has at least 3 elements. Therefore, `i` should be the third element in the list `costs`.

The state of `costs` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The other variables `n`, `k`, and `h` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 times the integer division of the original value of `n` by the second element in the list `costs`, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is larger than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `costs`, `h` is equal to the original value of `h` plus 2 times the integer division of the original value of `n` by the second element in the list `costs`**
