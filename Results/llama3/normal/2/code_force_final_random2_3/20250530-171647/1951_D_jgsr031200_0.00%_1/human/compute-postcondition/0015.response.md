According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `costs`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, `costs` must have at least 1 element and `i` is the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is larger than or equal to `k`, `costs` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list, `h` is 0**
