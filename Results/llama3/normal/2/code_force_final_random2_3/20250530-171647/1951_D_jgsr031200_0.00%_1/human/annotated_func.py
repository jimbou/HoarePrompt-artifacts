#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers.
    if (n == k) :

        #The program returns nothing because there is no value or variable specified in the return statement. The values of n and k remain unchanged as positive integers and equal to each other. The program has previously printed 'YES' and the number 1 twice.
    #State: *n and k are positive integers, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no value or expression specified in the return statement. The values of n and k remain unchanged, with n being a positive integer less than k. The program also does not print anything, as the 'NO' print statement is not executed due to the return statement.
    #State: *n and k are positive integers, n is not equal to k, and n is larger than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the sum of the products of the integer division of the original value of n by each element in the list costs and the corresponding element in the list costs, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing at least 2 elements, h is equal to the original value of h plus the sum of the integer divisions of the original value of n by each element in the list costs.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :

        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: [costs[0]], [costs[1]], ..., [costs[m]] (where m is the index of the last element in the list costs)
    #State: *n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the sum of the products of the integer division of the original value of n by each element in the list costs and the corresponding element in the list costs, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing at least 2 elements, h is equal to the original value of h plus the sum of the integer divisions of the original value of n by each element in the list costs. If h is less than k, 'NO' is printed. If h is larger than or equal to k, the number 2 is printed, 'YES' is printed, and all elements in the list costs are printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether it is possible to make a certain number of purchases (k) with a given amount of money (n) and prints the result. If n is equal to k, it prints 'YES' and the number 1 twice. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' and returns without printing anything else. If n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the maximum number of purchases that can be made with the given amount of money and prints 'NO' if this number is less than k, or prints 'YES', the number 2, and the costs of the purchases if this number is greater than or equal to k. The function does not return any value.
