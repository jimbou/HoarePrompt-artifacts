Based on the initial state, the code will print the number 1.

Here's the explanation:

* The initial state mentions that n and k are positive integers, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* The initial state also mentions that the current value of n is equal to the current value of k, but again, this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* The initial state mentions that 'YES' is being printed, but this is not related to the print statement in question.
* The print statement simply prints the number 1.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1**
