Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus i times the integer division of n by i, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list, h is equal to the original value of h plus the integer division of n by i**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been reduced by the product of `i` and the integer division of `n` by `i`. The value of `h` has been incremented by the integer division of `n` by `i`. The values of `k`, `costs`, and `i` remain unchanged.
