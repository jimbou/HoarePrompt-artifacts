Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to make a certain number of purchases (k) with a given amount of money (n) and prints the result.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If n is equal to k, it prints 'YES' and the number 1 twice, indicating that it is possible to make k purchases with n amount of money, and the cost of each purchase is 1.

2. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to make k purchases with n amount of money.

3. If n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the maximum number of purchases that can be made with the given amount of money. It does this by dividing n by the cost of each purchase (which is n - k + 1 and 1) and adding up the results. If the total number of purchases is less than k, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', the number 2 (indicating that two purchases are needed), and the costs of the purchases.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
