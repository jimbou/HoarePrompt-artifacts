Based on the initial state, the print statement `print(*costs)` will print the elements of the list `costs` as separate arguments.

Since the list `costs` contains at least 2 elements, the output will be a sequence of values separated by spaces.

Output: **[costs[0]], [costs[1]], ..., [costs[m]] (where m is the index of the last element in the list costs)**
