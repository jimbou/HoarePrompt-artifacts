Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the sum of the products of the integer division of the original value of n by each element in the list costs and the corresponding element in the list costs, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing at least 2 elements, h is equal to the original value of h plus the sum of the integer divisions of the original value of n by each element in the list costs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `n` is reduced by the sum of the products of the integer division of the original value of `n` by each element in the list `costs` and the corresponding element in the list `costs`. The value of `k` remains unchanged, and `n` is still not equal to `k` and is larger than or equal to `k`. The list `costs` still contains at least 2 elements. The value of `h` is increased by the sum of the integer divisions of the original value of `n` by each element in the list `costs`.
