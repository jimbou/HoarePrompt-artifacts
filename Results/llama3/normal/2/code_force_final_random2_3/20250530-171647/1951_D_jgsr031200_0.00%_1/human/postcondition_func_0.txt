This function determines whether it is possible to make a certain number of purchases (k) with a given amount of money (n) and prints the result. If n is equal to k, it prints 'YES' and the number 1 twice. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' and returns without printing anything else. If n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the maximum number of purchases that can be made with the given amount of money and prints 'NO' if this number is less than k, or prints 'YES', the number 2, and the costs of the purchases if this number is greater than or equal to k. The function does not return any value.
