Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 times the integer division of the original value of n by the second element in the list costs, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list, h is equal to the original value of h plus 2 times the integer division of the original value of n by the second element in the list costs.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be its original value minus 2 times the integer division of the original value of `n` by the second element in the list `costs`. The value of `h` has been updated to be the original value of `h` plus 2 times the integer division of the original value of `n` by the second element in the list `costs`. The values of `k`, `costs`, and `i` remain unchanged.
