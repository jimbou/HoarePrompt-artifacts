Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in costs:
    curr = n // i
    h += curr
    n -= i * curr


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus i times the integer division of n by i, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list, h is equal to the original value of h plus the integer division of n by i

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 times the integer division of the original value of n by the second element in the list costs, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list, h is equal to the original value of h plus 2 times the integer division of the original value of n by the second element in the list costs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2 times the integer division of the original value of n by the second element in the list costs minus i times the integer division of the original value of n minus 2 times the integer division of the original value of n by the second element in the list costs by the third element in the list costs, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing at least 3 elements, i is the third element in the list costs, h is equal to the original value of h plus 2 times the integer division of the original value of n by the second element in the list costs plus the integer division of the original value of n minus 2 times the integer division of the original value of n by the second element in the list costs by the third element in the list costs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
