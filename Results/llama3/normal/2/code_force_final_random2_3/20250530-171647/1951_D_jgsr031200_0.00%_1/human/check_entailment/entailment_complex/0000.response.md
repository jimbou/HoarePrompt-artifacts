Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Bob to set up his jewelry store in such a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels with her n coins. The program takes into account the greedy behavior of Alice, who will buy as many jewels as possible from each stall before moving on to the next one.

The program first checks if n is equal to k, in which case it prints 'YES' and the number 1 twice, indicating that Alice can buy exactly k jewels with her n coins.

If n is less than k, the program prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly k jewels with her n coins.

If n is greater than or equal to k, the program calculates the maximum number of purchases that can be made with the given amount of money. It does this by dividing n by the costs of the purchases (which are stored in the list costs) and summing up the results. If the total number of purchases is less than k, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', the number 2, and the costs of the purchases.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately solves the problem. However, there are a few issues with the program's implementation:

1. The function func_1 is not defined anywhere in the program. It is called at the beginning of the program, but its definition is not provided.

2. The program uses a lot of global variables, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain. It would be better to encapsulate the variables and functions within a class or a separate module.

3. The program does not handle invalid inputs. For example, if the input is not a positive integer, the program will throw an error. It would be better to add some error checking code to handle such cases.

4. The program's output is not very user-friendly. For example, when the program prints 'YES', it would be better to print a more descriptive message, such as "It is possible for Alice to buy exactly k jewels with her n coins."

5. The program does not provide any explanation for its output. For example, when the program prints 'NO', it would be better to print a message explaining why it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly k jewels with her n coins.

Overall, while the program's logic is correct, its implementation could be improved in several ways.

Correctness: **False**
