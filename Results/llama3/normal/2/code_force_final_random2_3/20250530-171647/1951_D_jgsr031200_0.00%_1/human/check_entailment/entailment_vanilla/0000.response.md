Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads two positive integers n and k, where n is the number of coins Alice has and k is the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

3. The program then calls the function func_1(n, k) to determine whether Bob can set up the stalls and prices to achieve the desired outcome.

4. The function func_1(n, k) first checks if n is equal to k. If so, it prints 'YES' and sets up a single stall with a price of 1, which would result in Alice buying exactly k jewels.

5. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' because Alice does not have enough coins to buy k jewels.

6. If n is greater than k, it calculates the costs of the stalls. The first stall has a cost of n - k + 1, and the second stall has a cost of 1.

7. It then calculates the total number of jewels Alice would buy from these two stalls. If the total number of jewels is less than k, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls with the calculated costs.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. However, there is a small mistake in the output format. When the program prints the costs of the stalls, it should print the number of stalls (which is 2) before printing the costs. But in the given program, it prints 'YES' again before printing the costs.

Correctness: **False**
