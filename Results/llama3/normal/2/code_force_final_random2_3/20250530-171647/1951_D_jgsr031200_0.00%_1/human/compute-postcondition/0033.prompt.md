You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers.
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing because there is no value or variable specified in the return statement. The values of n and k remain unchanged as positive integers and equal to each other. The program has previously printed 'YES' and the number 1 twice.
    #State: *n and k are positive integers, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no value or expression specified in the return statement. The values of n and k remain unchanged, with n being a positive integer less than k. The program also does not print anything, as the 'NO' print statement is not executed due to the return statement.
    #State: *n and k are positive integers, n is not equal to k, and n is larger than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the sum of the products of the integer division of the original value of n by each element in the list costs and the corresponding element in the list costs, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing at least 2 elements, h is equal to the original value of h plus the sum of the integer divisions of the original value of n by each element in the list costs.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: [costs[0]], [costs[1]], ..., [costs[m]] (where m is the index of the last element in the list costs)
    #State: *n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the sum of the products of the integer division of the original value of n by each element in the list costs and the corresponding element in the list costs, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing at least 2 elements, h is equal to the original value of h plus the sum of the integer divisions of the original value of n by each element in the list costs. If h is less than k, 'NO' is printed. If h is larger than or equal to k, the number 2 is printed, 'YES' is printed, and all elements in the list costs are printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing because there is no value or variable specified in the return statement. The values of n and k remain unchanged as positive integers and equal to each other. The program has previously printed 'YES' and the number 1 twice.

Case_2: The program returns nothing, as there is no value or expression specified in the return statement. The values of n and k remain unchanged, with n being a positive integer less than k. The program also does not print anything, as the 'NO' print statement is not executed due to the return statement.

Case_3: n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the sum of the products of the integer division of the original value of n by each element in the list costs and the corresponding element in the list costs, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing at least 2 elements, h is equal to the original value of h plus the sum of the integer divisions of the original value of n by each element in the list costs, and the current value of h is less than k, and 'NO' is printed

Case_4: n is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the sum of the products of the integer division of the original value of n by each element in the list costs and the corresponding element in the list costs, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing at least 2 elements, h is equal to the original value of h plus the sum of the integer divisions of the original value of n by each element in the list costs, and h is larger than or equal to k, the number 2 is being printed, 'YES' is being printed, and all elements in the list costs are being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
