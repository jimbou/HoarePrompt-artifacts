The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i.  If i is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is less than or equal to 1001, So for the loop to be executed one more time i must be less than or equal to 1000.
State: **`i` is less than or equal to 1000, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer.**
