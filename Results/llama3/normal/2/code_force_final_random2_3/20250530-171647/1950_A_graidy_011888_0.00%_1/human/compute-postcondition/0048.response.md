Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to 1001, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `y` is greater than `z`, `res` is 'peak'. If `y` is less than `z`, then `res` is 'stair'. If `y` is equal to `z`, then `res` is 'none'. If `x` is not less than `y`, then `res` is 'none', and this is printed: "[x] [y] [z]" where `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 1 and 9, and `res` is printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
