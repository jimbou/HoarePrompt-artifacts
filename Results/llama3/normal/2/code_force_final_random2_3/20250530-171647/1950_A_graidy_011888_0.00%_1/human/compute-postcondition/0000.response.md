Output State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been set to 1. The stdin still contains two inputs: the first input is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and the second input is a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (each between 0 and 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer.
