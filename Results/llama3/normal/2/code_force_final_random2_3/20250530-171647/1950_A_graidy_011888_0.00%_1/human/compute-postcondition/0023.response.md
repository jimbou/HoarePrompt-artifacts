Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to 1000, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'peak', stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The value of `res` has been updated to 'peak'. The stdin still contains two inputs: the first integer and the sequence of 3 space-separated integers repeated the same number of times as the first integer.
