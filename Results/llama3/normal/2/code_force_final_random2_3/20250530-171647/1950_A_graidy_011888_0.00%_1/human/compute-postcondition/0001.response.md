According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, which is less than 1000, so the loop can certainly execute one time. No states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer.**
