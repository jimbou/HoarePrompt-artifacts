Postcondition: ***i is less than or equal to 1000, x is an integer between 1 and 9, y is an integer between 1 and 9, z is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer. If y is greater than z, then res is 'peak'. If y is less than z, then res is 'stair', otherwise res is 'none'.***
