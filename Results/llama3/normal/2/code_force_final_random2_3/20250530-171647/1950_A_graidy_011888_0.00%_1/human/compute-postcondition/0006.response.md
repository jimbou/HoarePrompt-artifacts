Postcondition: ***i is 1, x is an integer between 1 and 9, y is an integer between 1 and 9, z is an integer between 1 and 9, res is an empty string, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer. The current value of x is less than the current value of y. The current value of y is less than or equal to the current value of z***
