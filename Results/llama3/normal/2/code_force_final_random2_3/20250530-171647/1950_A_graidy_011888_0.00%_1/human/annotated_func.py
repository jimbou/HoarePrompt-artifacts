#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer.
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is 1001, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `y` is greater than `z`, `res` is 'peak'. If `y` is less than `z`, then `res` is 'stair'. If `y` is equal to `z`, then `res` is 'none'. If `x` is not less than `y`, then `res` is 'none', and the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are printed, separated by spaces, and `res` is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates and prints a sequence of random 3-space separated integers between 1 and 9, along with a corresponding classification ('peak', 'stair', or 'none') based on the relative values of the integers, repeating this process a number of times specified by the first input integer.
