The `print(x, y, z, sep=' ')` statement will print the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` separated by spaces.

Based on the precondition, `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 1 and 9. However, their exact values are not specified.

Output: **x (an integer between 1 and 9), y (an integer between 1 and 9), z (an integer between 1 and 9)**
