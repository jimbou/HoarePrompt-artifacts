Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer.
Code of the loop:
while i <= 1000:
    x = randint(1, 9)
    y = randint(1, 9)
    z = randint(1, 9)
    res = ''
    if x < y:
        if y > z:
            res = 'peak'
        elif y < z:
            res = 'stair'
        else:
            res = 'none'
    else:
        res = 'none'
    print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
    print(res)
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer. If x is less than y, then if y is greater than z, res is 'peak'. If y is less than z, then res is 'stair'. If y is equal to z, then res is 'none'. If x is not less than y, then res is 'none'. The values of x, y, and z are being printed, separated by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is less than or equal to 1001, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `y` is greater than `z`, `res` is 'peak'. If `y` is less than `z`, then `res` is 'stair', otherwise `res` is 'none'. If `x` is not less than `y`, then `res` is 'none', and the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are printed, separated by spaces, and `res` is printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is less than or equal to 1001, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `y` is greater than `z`, `res` is 'peak'. If `y` is less than `z`, then `res` is 'stair'. If `y` is equal to `z`, then `res` is 'none'. If `x` is not less than `y`, then `res` is 'none', and this is printed: "[x] [y] [z]" where `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 1 and 9, and `res` is printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
