Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to 1000, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 'none', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains two inputs, with the first input being an integer between 1 and 1000, and the second input being a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer.
