Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9 and is greater than `z`, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'peak', stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer, and the current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 'peak', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains two inputs, and the relationship between `x` and `y` remains the same.
