Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer. The current value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`. The current value of `y` is equal to the current value of `z`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been changed to 'none'. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain the same. The stdin still contains two inputs. The relationship between `x`, `y`, and `z` remains the same, with `x` being less than `y` and `y` being equal to `z`.
