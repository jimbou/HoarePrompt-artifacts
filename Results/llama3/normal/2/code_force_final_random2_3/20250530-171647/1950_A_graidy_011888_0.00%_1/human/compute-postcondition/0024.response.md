Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to 1000, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'stair', stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to 'stair', while the values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
