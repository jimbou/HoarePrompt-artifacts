Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer.
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is 1001, `x` is an integer between 1 and 9, `y` is an integer between 1 and 9, `z` is an integer between 1 and 9, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a sequence of 3 space-separated integers (0 <= integer <= 9) repeated the same number of times as the first integer. If `x` is less than `y`, then if `y` is greater than `z`, `res` is 'peak'. If `y` is less than `z`, then `res` is 'stair'. If `y` is equal to `z`, then `res` is 'none'. If `x` is not less than `y`, then `res` is 'none', and the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are printed, separated by spaces, and `res` is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates and prints a sequence of random 3-space separated integers between 1 and 9, along with a corresponding classification ('peak', 'stair', or 'none') based on the relative values of the integers, repeating this process a number of times specified by the first input integer.
