Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than or equal to `a[l]`, `sunks` is a positive integer and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that it is directly inside. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of a loop or if statement.
