Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus twice a[l], a is a list of n positive integers where a[r] is equal to its original value minus a[l], l is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), and a[r] is less than a[l]. If a[r] is 0, then r is between 0 and n - 2 (inclusive) and sunks is equal to its original value plus 1.**
