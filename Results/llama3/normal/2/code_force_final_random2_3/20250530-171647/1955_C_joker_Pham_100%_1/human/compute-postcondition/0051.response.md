Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is less than or equal to r, l is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), r is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), a[r] is less than a[l], sunks is a positive integer. If l is equal to r and k is greater than or equal to a[r], then sunks is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If l is not equal to r, no change occurs. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been decreased by twice the value of `a[l]`, and the value of `a[r]` has been decreased by the value of `a[l]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
