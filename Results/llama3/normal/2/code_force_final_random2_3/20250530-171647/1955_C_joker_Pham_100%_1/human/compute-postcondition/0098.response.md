Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `l` is `n`, `r` is -1, `sunks` is a positive integer.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `n` remains unchanged, the value of `k` becomes 0, the list `a` contains non-negative integers, the value of `l` becomes `n`, the value of `r` becomes -1, and the value of `sunks` is a positive integer.
