Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`, `l` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than or equal to `a[l]`. If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice `a[l]`, `k` is updated to its original value minus twice `a[l]`, `a[r]` is updated to its original value minus `a[l]`, `l` is between 1 and `n - 1` (inclusive), and `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is between 0 and `n - 2` (inclusive) and `sunks` is incremented by 2. If `k` is less than twice `a[l]`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
