Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive). If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `l` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between -1 and `n - 2` (inclusive), `a[r + 1]` is less than `a[l]`, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r + 1] * 2`, `a[l]` is less than its original value, and the current value of `sunks` is a positive integer greater than its original value plus 1. If `a[l]` equals 0, then `l` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `a[r + 1]` is less than `a[l - 1]`, the current value of `a[l - 1]` is 0, and the current value of `sunks` is a positive integer greater than its original value plus 2. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, then if `a[r] * 2` equals `k`, `sunks` is a positive integer greater than its original value by 1. Otherwise, the product of `a[r]` and 2 is not equal to `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, then if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `l` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than or equal to its original value, and the current value of `sunks` is a positive integer greater than its original value. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then the current value of `sunks` is 2. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is between 0 and `n - 2` (inclusive), `a[r + 1]` is 0, and if `l` equals `r + 1` and `k` is greater than or equal to the original value of `a[r + 1]`, then the current value of `sunks` is 3. Otherwise, if `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `l` equals `r`, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, and `sunks` is 2. Otherwise, if `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then the current value of `sunks` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. The value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the value of `a[r]`.***
