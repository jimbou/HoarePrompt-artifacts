The variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, so for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` must be less than `r`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`, `l` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than or equal to `a[l]`.**
