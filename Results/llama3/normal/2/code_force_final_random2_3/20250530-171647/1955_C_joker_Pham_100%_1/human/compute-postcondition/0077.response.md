Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`, `l` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than or equal to `a[l]`. If `l` equals `r`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
