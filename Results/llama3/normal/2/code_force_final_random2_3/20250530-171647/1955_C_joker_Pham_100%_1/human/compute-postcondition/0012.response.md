Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive). The value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the value of `a[r]`. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then the current value of `sunks` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. Additionally, the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[l]`.**
