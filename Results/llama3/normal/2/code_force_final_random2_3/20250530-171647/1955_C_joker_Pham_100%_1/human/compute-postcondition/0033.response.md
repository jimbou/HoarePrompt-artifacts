Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is between 1 and n (inclusive), r is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), a[r] is less than a[l - 1], k is greater than or equal to a[r] * 2, the current value of a[l - 1] is 0, the current value of sunks is a positive integer greater than its original value plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `sunks` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `a[r]` and `a[l - 1]` is maintained, and the value of `k` is still greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`. The value of `a[l - 1]` is still 0.
