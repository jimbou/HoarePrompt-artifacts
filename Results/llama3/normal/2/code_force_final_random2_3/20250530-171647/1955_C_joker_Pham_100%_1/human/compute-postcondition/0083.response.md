Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`, `l` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than or equal to `a[l]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and the relationship between `a[r]` and `a[l]` remain unchanged. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
