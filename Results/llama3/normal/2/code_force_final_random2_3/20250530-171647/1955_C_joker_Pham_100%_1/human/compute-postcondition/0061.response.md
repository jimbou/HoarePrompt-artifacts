Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than or equal to `a[l]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `l` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` is equal to `k`, `sunks` is increased by 1; otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is 0, then the same conditions as above are met.**
