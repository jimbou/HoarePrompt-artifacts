Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is less than or equal to r, l is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), r is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), a[r] is less than a[l], sunks is a positive integer. If a[r] is 0, then l is less than or equal to r - 1, r is between 0 and n - 2 (inclusive), and sunks is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
