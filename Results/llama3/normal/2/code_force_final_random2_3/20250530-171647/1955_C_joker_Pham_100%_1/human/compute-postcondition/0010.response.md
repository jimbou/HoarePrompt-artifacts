Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive). If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
