Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), r is between -1 and n - 2 (inclusive), a[r + 1] is less than a[l], k is greater than or equal to a[r + 1] * 2, a[l] is less than its original value, and the current value of sunks is a positive integer greater than its original value plus 1. If a[l] equals 0, then l is between 1 and n (inclusive), a[r + 1] is less than a[l - 1], the current value of a[l - 1] is 0, and the current value of sunks is a positive integer greater than its original value plus 2.**
