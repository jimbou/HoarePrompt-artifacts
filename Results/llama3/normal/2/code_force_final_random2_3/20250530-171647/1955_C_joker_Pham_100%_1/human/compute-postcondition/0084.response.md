Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than `r`, `l` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than or equal to `a[l]`. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
