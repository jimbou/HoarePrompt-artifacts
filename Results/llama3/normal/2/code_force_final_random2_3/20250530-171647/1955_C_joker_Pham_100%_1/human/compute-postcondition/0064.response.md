Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, a is a list of n positive integers. If a[l] is 0, then k is decreased by 2 times the value of a[r], a[l] is decreased by a[r], l is between 1 and n (inclusive), r is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), a[r] is less than a[l], and sunks is increased by 1. If a[l] is not 0, then the conditions remain the same as in the precondition. If k is greater than or equal to a[l] * 2, then l is between 1 and n (inclusive), r is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), a[r] is less than a[l], and sunks is increased by 1. If k is less than a[l] * 2, then if a[l] * 2 - 1 is equal to k, sunks is increased by 1; otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If k is 0, then the same conditions as above are met.***
