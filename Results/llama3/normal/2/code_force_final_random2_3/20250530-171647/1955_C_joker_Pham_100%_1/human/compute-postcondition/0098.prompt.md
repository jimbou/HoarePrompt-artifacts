Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, l is 0, r is n - 1, sunks is 0
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` and `r` are between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive). If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `l` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between -1 and `n - 2` (inclusive), `a[r + 1]` is less than `a[l]`, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r + 1] * 2`, `a[l]` is less than its original value, and the current value of `sunks` is a positive integer greater than its original value plus 1. If `a[l]` equals 0, then `l` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `a[r + 1]` is less than `a[l - 1]`, the current value of `a[l - 1]` is 0, and the current value of `sunks` is a positive integer greater than its original value plus 2. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, then if `a[r] * 2` equals `k`, `sunks` is a positive integer greater than its original value by 1. Otherwise, the product of `a[r]` and 2 is not equal to `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, then if `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `l` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than or equal to its original value, and the current value of `sunks` is a positive integer greater than its original value. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then the current value of `sunks` is 2. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is between 0 and `n - 2` (inclusive), `a[r + 1]` is 0, and if `l` equals `r + 1` and `k` is greater than or equal to the original value of `a[r + 1]`, then the current value of `sunks` is 3. Otherwise, if `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `l` equals `r`, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, and `sunks` is 2. Otherwise, if `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then the current value of `sunks` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. The value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the value of `a[r]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than or equal to `a[l]`. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is increased by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, then if `a[r] * 2` equals `k`, `sunks` is increased by 1. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2` and `a[r] * 2` does not equal `k`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, `l` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`, then if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is increased by 1; otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is 0, then the same conditions as above are met. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, then the conditions remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than or equal to `a[l]`. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to twice `a[r]`, `k` is updated to its original value minus twice `a[r]`, `a[r]` is updated to its original value minus `a[l]`, `l` is between 1 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 2` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 2. If `k` is less than twice `a[r]` and `a[r] * 2` equals `k`, then `l` is between 1 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 2` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, then the function continues to execute without any changes.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
