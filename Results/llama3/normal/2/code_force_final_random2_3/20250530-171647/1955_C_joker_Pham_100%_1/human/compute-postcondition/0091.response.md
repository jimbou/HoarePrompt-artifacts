Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer less than its original value minus twice a[r], a is a list of n positive integers where a[l] is less than its original value minus a[r] and a[r] is less than or equal to a[l], l is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), r is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), a[r] is less than or equal to a[l]. If a[l] is equal to 0, then l is between 1 and n (inclusive) and sunks is one more than its original value. Otherwise, the values of l and sunks remain unchanged.***
