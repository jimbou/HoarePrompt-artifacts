Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of n positive integers, l and r are between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), a[r] is less than or equal to its original value, and if l equals r and k is greater than or equal to a[r], then the current value of sunks is 1. If a[r] is 0, then r is between 0 and n - 2 (inclusive), a[r + 1] is 0, and if l equals r + 1 and k is greater than or equal to the original value of a[r + 1], then the current value of sunks is 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
