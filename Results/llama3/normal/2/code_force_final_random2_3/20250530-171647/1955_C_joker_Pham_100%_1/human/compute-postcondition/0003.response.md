Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values because the `break` statement does not modify any variables. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement we were directly inside.
