Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `l` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than or equal to `a[l]`, `sunks` is a positive integer. If `l` is equal to `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` is not equal to `r`, no change occurs. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
