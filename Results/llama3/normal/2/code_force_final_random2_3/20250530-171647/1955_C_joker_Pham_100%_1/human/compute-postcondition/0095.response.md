Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `l` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than or equal to `a[l]`. If `a[r] * 2` equals `k`, then `l` is between 1 and `n - 1` (inclusive), `r` is between 0 and `n - 2` (inclusive), `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
