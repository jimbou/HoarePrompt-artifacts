Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the third character `j` in the string `a` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 1. If the third character `j` in the string `a` is not 'A', then `l` is 0 and `h` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been incremented by 1. If the third character `j` in the string `a` is 'A', then `h` is now 1. If the third character `j` in the string `a` is not 'A', then `h` is now 3. The values of the other variables remain the same.
