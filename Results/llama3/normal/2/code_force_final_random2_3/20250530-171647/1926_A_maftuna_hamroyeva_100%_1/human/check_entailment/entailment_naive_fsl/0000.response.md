Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately determines which letter appears most frequently in the input string of length 5, consisting of only 'A's and 'B's. The program iterates through each character in the string, incrementing a counter for 'A's and another for 'B's. After iterating through the entire string, it compares the counts and prints the letter that appears most frequently.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When 'A' appears more frequently than 'B'
* When 'B' appears more frequently than 'A'
* When 'A' and 'B' appear with the same frequency (in which case, the program prints 'B', which is a valid output since the problem description does not specify what to do in case of a tie)

The program also handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the input string contains only 'A's or only 'B's.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
