Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 2 characters, `l` is the number of 'A's in the string `a` plus two if the first character in the string `a` is 'A', otherwise `l` is the number of 'A's in the string `a` plus one, `h` is the number of 'B's in the string `a` plus one if the first character in the string `a` is not 'A', otherwise `h` is the number of 'B's in the string `a`, `j` is the second character in the string `a`, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, so it is now the number of 'A's in the string `a` plus two if the first character in the string `a` is 'A', otherwise `l` is the number of 'A's in the string `a` plus one. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
