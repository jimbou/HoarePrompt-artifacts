Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of length 4 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `j` is the second character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 1 and `h` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is now 2, and if `j` is 'B', then `l` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
