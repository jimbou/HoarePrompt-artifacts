Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the third character `j` in the string `a` is 'A', then `l` is 3 and `h` is 0. If the third character `j` in the string `a` is not 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 2. If the third character `j` in the string `a` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 1. If the third character `j` in the string `a` is not 'A', then `l` is 0 and `h` is 3.***
