This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. It then iterates over each string, counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. If the count of 'A's is greater than the count of 'B's, it prints 'A' t times. Otherwise, it prints 'B' t times. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the standard input by consuming the input strings and prints the result to the standard output.
