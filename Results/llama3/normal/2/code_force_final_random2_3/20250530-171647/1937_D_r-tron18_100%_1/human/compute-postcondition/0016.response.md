Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n with the last element being zeroInd - oneInd, i is n - 1, el is '<', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1, and zr is strictly larger than ol.**

The code snippet modifies the `ans` list by assigning a new value to its last element, which is calculated based on the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. The `zeroInd` is calculated using the `func_1` function, which is not defined in the provided code, but its impact is reflected in the final state. The `oneInd` is calculated as twice the last element of the `preOne` list. The new value assigned to the last element of the `ans` list is the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged.
