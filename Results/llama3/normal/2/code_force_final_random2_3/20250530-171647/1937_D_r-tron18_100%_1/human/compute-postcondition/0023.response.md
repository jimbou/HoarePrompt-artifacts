Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n where the second last element is modified, i is n - 2, el is the character at index n - 2 in s1 which is either '<' or '>' depending on the second last character of s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 1, zeroInd is 2 * suffZero[-1], oneInd is func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1), fi is func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr).**

The code snippet modifies the `ans` list by updating its second last element. The new value of `ans[i]` is calculated based on the values of `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `n`, and `fi`. The `zeroInd` is calculated as twice the last element of `suffZero`, which depends on whether the last character of `s1` is '>' or '<'. The `oneInd` is calculated using the `func_1` function, which takes `preOne` and an index as arguments. The `fi` is also calculated using the `func_1` function. The final value of `ans[i]` is the result of the expression `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
