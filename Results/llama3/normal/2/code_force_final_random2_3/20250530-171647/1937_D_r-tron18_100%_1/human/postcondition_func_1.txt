The function takes a string s1 of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and returns a list of length n. The list contains the results of operations performed on the string s1 and the indices of '>' characters in s1. The function modifies the input string s1 by iterating over it from right to left, and for each character, it performs calculations based on the number of '>' characters to its right and left. The function returns the modified list, which represents the result of these calculations.
