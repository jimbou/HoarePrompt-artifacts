According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now `n - 1`. 

State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`, `i` is `n - 1**
