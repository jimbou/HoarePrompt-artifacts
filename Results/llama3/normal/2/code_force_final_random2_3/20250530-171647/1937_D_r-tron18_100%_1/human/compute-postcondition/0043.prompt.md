Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of zeros of length n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n where the last element is modified, i is n - 1, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the last character of s1. If the last character of s1 is '>', totalOne is decreased by one, preOne has its last element removed, and the last element of ans is modified. If the last character of s1 is '<', the value at index i in ans is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 if zr is less than or equal to ol, otherwise the value at index i is zeroInd - oneInd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n where the second last element is modified, i is n - 2, el is the character at index n - 2 in s1 which is either '<' or '>' depending on the second last character of s1. If el is '>', then totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, and zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 1. If el is '<', then ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the number of elements in suffZero minus 1, suffZero contains an additional element which is the sum of the last element of suffZero and i + 1. If zr is less than or equal to ol, the second last element of ans is the difference between the sum of the last two elements of suffZero and twice the value returned by func_1(preOne, zr) plus n + 1. Otherwise, the second last element of ans is equal to 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two or three elements: 0, n, and the sum of the last element of suffZero and i + 1, ans is a list of length n where the last element is modified, i is n - 3, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the last character of s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 1 or 2. If el is '>', then totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, and zr is the number of elements in suffZero minus 1. If el is '<', then ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the number of elements in suffZero minus 1, and suffZero contains an additional element which is the sum of the last element of suffZero and i + 1. If zr is less than or equal to ol, the last element of ans is the difference between the sum of the last two elements of suffZero and twice the value returned by func_1(preOne, zr) plus n + 1. Otherwise, ans[i] is the difference between twice the value returned by func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) minus func_1(suffZero, 1) and twice the value of preOne[-1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
