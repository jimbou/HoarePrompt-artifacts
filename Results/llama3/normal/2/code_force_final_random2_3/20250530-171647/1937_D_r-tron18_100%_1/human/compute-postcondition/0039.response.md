Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains three elements: 0, n, and the sum of the last element of suffZero and i + 1, ans is a list of length n where the element at index n - 3 is modified, i is n - 3, el is the character at index n - 3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 2, the element at index n - 3 of ans is the difference between the sum of the last two elements of suffZero and twice the value returned by func_1(preOne, zr) plus n + 1.**

The code calculates the index of the last zero and the index of the last one in the string s1, then updates the element at index n - 3 in the list ans based on these indices and the value of n. The value of ans[i] is calculated as the difference between the sum of the last two elements of suffZero and twice the value returned by func_1(preOne, zr) plus n + 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
