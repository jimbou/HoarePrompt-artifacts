Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n where the second last element is modified to be equal to 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1], i is n - 2, el is the character at index n - 2 in s1 which is either '<' or '>' depending on the second last character of s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the number of elements in suffZero minus 1, suffZero contains an additional element which is the sum of the last element of suffZero and i + 1.**

The code modifies the second last element of the list `ans` by assigning it the value of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1]`. The value of `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, and the value of `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1]`. The difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd` is then assigned to `ans[i]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
