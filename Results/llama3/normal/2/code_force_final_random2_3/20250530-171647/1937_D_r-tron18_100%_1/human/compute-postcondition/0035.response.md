Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n where the element at index i is modified, i is n - 3, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the last character of s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the number of elements in suffZero minus 1.**

The code snippet calculates the value of `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi` using the provided functions `func_1` and the values of `suffZero`, `preOne`, and `zr`. It then updates the value of `ans` at index `i` using these calculated values and the values of `n` and `fi`. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged.
