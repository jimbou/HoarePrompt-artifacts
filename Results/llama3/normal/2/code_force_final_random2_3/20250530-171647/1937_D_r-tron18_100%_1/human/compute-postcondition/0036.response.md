Postcondition: ***s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n where the last element is modified, i is n - 3, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the last character of s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the number of elements in suffZero minus 1. If ol is less than or equal to zr, then ans[i] is the difference between 2 times the result of func_1(suffZero, ol) and 2 times the last element of preOne minus the result of func_1(preOne, 1). Otherwise, the element at index i in ans is modified.***
