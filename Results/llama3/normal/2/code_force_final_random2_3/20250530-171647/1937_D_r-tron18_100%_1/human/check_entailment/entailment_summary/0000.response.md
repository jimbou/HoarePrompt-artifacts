Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of simulating the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

Function func_1 calculates the difference between the last element of the input list `arr` and the element at a specific index, which is determined by the number of elements in `arr` and the input integer `times`. 

Function func_2 takes a string s1 of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and returns a list of length n. The list contains the results of operations performed on the string s1 and the indices of '>' characters in s1. The function modifies the input string s1 by iterating over it from right to left, and for each character, it performs calculations based on the number of '>' characters to its right and left.

The program uses these functions to simulate the movement of the pinball on the grid. It first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the string representing the grid. It then calls function func_2 to simulate the movement of the pinball and prints the results.

Based on the execution summaries of the functions, it appears that the program correctly simulates the movement of the pinball on the grid and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

Correctness: **True**
