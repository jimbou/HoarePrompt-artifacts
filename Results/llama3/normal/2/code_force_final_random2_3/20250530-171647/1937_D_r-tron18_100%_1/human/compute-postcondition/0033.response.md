Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of `s1` is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where the last element is modified, `i` is `n - 3`, `el` is either '<' or '>' depending on the last character of `s1`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is the number of elements in `suffZero` minus 1.**

In this output state, the values of `ol` and `zr` have been updated to be equal to `totalOne` and `len(suffZero) - 1`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
