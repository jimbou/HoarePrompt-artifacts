Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of `s1` is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where the second last element is modified, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1` which is either '<' or '>' depending on the second last character of `s1`, `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `zr` is 0 if the last character of `s1` is '>', otherwise it is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of two new variables `ol` and `zr`. The value of `ol` is the same as `totalOne`, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. The value of `zr` is 0 if the last character of `s1` is '>', otherwise it is 1, which is equivalent to the second last element of `suffZero`.
