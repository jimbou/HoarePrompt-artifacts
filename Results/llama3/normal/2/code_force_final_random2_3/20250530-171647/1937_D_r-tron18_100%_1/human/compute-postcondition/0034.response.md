Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n where the last element is modified, i is n - 3, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the last character of s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the number of elements in suffZero minus 1, zeroInd is 2 times the result of func_1(suffZero, ol), oneInd is 2 times the last element of preOne minus the result of func_1(preOne, 1), ans[i] is the difference between zeroInd and oneInd.**

In this output state, the variables s1, n, pre, totalOne, preOne, suffZero, el, ol, and zr remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable i is still n - 3. The variable ans has been modified, with its element at index i (which is n - 3) now being the difference between zeroInd and oneInd. The variables zeroInd and oneInd are new and have been calculated based on the values of suffZero, ol, preOne, and the function func_1.
