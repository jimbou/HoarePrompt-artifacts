Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n where the second last element is modified to be equal to 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)), i is n - 2, el is the character at index n - 2 in s1 which is either '<' or '>' depending on the second last character of s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 1.**

The code modifies the second last element of the `ans` list by assigning it a value calculated based on the `suffZero`, `ol`, `preOne`, and `func_1` function. The `func_1` function is not defined in the provided code, so its exact behavior is unknown. However, it is clear that it takes two arguments and returns a value that is used in the calculation of the new value for `ans[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
