Postcondition: ***s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two or three elements: 0, n, and the sum of the last element of suffZero and i + 1, ans is a list of length n where the last element is modified, i is n - 3, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the last character of s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 1 or 2. If el is '>', then totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, and zr is the number of elements in suffZero minus 1. If el is '<', then ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the number of elements in suffZero minus 1, and suffZero contains an additional element which is the sum of the last element of suffZero and i + 1. If zr is less than or equal to ol, the last element of ans is the difference between the sum of the last two elements of suffZero and twice the value returned by func_1(preOne, zr) plus n + 1. Otherwise, ans[i] is the difference between twice the value returned by func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) minus func_1(suffZero, 1) and twice the value of preOne[-1].***
