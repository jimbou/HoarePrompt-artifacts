The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` must be `n - 2` and `n` must be at least 2.
State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n where the second last element is modified, i is n - 2, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the second last character of s1.**
