Postcondition: ***s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains three elements: 0, n, and the sum of the last element of suffZero and i + 1, ans is a list of length n where the last element is modified, i is n - 3, el is the character at index n - 3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 2. If zr is less than or equal to ol, the element at index n - 3 of ans is the difference between the sum of the last two elements of suffZero and twice the value returned by func_1(preOne, zr) plus n + 1. Otherwise, ans[i] is the difference between twice the value returned by func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) minus func_1(suffZero, 1) and twice the value of preOne[-1].***
