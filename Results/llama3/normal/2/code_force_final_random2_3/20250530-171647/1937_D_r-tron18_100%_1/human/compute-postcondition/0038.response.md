Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains three elements: 0, n, and the sum of the last element of suffZero and i + 1, ans is a list of length n where the last element is modified, i is n - 3, el is the character at index n - 3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 2, if zr is less than or equal to ol, the last element of ans is the difference between the sum of the last two elements of suffZero and twice the value returned by func_1(preOne, zr) plus n + 1, otherwise, the last element of ans is equal to 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1].**

The code modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   `suffZero` is updated by appending the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1`.
*   `ol` and `zr` are assigned the values of `totalOne` and `len(suffZero) - 1`, respectively.
*   The last element of `ans` is modified based on the values of `zr` and `ol`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, the last element of `ans` is calculated as the difference between the sum of the last two elements of `suffZero` and twice the value returned by `func_1(preOne, zr)` plus `n + 1`. Otherwise, the last element of `ans` is calculated as 2 times the value returned by `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` minus the value returned by `func_1(suffZero, 1)` minus 2 times the last element of `preOne`.
*   `el` is assigned the value of the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`.
