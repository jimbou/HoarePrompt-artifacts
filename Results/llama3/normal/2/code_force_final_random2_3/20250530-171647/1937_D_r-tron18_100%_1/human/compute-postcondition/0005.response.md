Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is '>', `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, and `zr` is 0. The current value of `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, meaning the number of '>' characters in `s1` is less than or equal to 0.**
