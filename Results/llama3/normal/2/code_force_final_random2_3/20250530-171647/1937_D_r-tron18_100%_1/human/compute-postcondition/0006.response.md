Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of length n with the last element modified, i is n - 1, el is '>', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, and zr is 0.**

The code snippet calculates the value of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` using the functions `func_1` and the lists `suffZero` and `preOne`. The value of `ans[i]` is then updated to be the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. The value of `i` is not modified, so it remains `n - 1`. The values of `el`, `ol`, and `zr` are also not modified, so they remain '>', the number of '>' characters in `s1`, and 0, respectively. The values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, and `preOne` are not modified by the code, so they remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `suffZero` is not modified, so it remains a list containing a single element 0. The value of `ans` is modified only at the last index `i`, so the rest of the elements remain 0.
