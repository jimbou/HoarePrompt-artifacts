Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of zeros of length n, i is n - 1, el is '<', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1.**

In this final state, the value of `suffZero` has been updated to include a new element, which is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` (0) and `i + 1` (n). The values of `ol` and `zr` have been assigned the values of `totalOne` and `len(suffZero) - 1`, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
