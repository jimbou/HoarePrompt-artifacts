State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n where the last element is modified, i is n - 3, el is the character at index n - 3 in s1 which is either '<' or '>' depending on the last character of s1. If el is '>', then totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, and zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 1. If el is '<', then ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is the number of elements in suffZero minus 1, suffZero contains an additional element which is the sum of the last element of suffZero and i + 1. If zr is less than or equal to ol, the last element of ans is the difference between the sum of the last two elements of suffZero and twice the value returned by func_1(preOne, zr) plus n + 1. Otherwise, the last element of ans is equal to 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1]**
