Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus one, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of length n with the last element modified, i is n - 1, el is '>', and zr is 0.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `totalOne` and `preOne`. The first line removes the last element from `preOne`, which is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`. The second line decrements `totalOne` by 1, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. The remaining variables and their values remain unchanged.
