Postcondition: ***s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n where the second last element is modified, i is n - 2, el is the character at index n - 2 in s1 which is either '<' or '>' depending on the second last character of s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 1. If ol is less than or equal to zr, the second last element of ans is modified to be equal to 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)). Otherwise, zeroInd is 2 * suffZero[-1], oneInd is func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1), and fi is func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr).***
