Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n where the value at index i is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1, i is n - 1, el is '<', ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 1. The current value of zr is less than or equal to the current value of ol.**

Here is a description of the output state in natural language:

The string s1 remains unchanged, consisting of characters '<' and '>' with a length of at least 2. The list pre still contains the indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed). The total number of '>' characters in s1, stored in totalOne, also remains the same. The list preOne continues to hold the cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1. The list suffZero still contains two elements: 0 and n. The list ans now has a value at index i (which is n - 1) calculated as zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1. The variables i, el, ol, and zr retain their original values, with zr being less than or equal to ol.
