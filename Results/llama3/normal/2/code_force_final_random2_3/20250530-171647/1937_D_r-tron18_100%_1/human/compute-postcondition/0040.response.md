Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains three elements: 0, n, and the sum of the last element of suffZero and i + 1, ans is a list of length n where the last element is modified, i is n - 3, el is the character at index n - 3 in s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1, zr is 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it is 2, ans[i] is the difference between twice the value returned by func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) minus func_1(suffZero, 1) and twice the value of preOne[-1].**

The code modifies the value of `ans[i]` by assigning it the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. `zeroInd` is calculated as twice the value returned by `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` minus the value returned by `func_1(suffZero, 1)`, while `oneInd` is twice the value of `preOne[-1]`. The values of `suffZero`, `preOne`, `ol`, and `preOne[-1]` are used in these calculations, but they are not modified by the code. The rest of the variables in the initial state remain unchanged.
