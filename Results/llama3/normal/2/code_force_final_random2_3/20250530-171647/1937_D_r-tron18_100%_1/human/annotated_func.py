#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and times is a non-negative integer.
    n = len(arr)

    #The program returns the difference between the last element in the list `arr` and the element at the index calculated by `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and `times` is a non-negative integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the difference between the last element of the input list `arr` and the element at a specific index, which is determined by the number of elements in `arr` and the input integer `times`. The specific index is calculated as `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `arr`.

    #This is printed: the modified elements of the ans list, which are the result of some operations on the string s1 and the lists pre, preOne, suffZero, and the variables totalOne and i

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a string s1 of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and returns a list of length n. The list contains the results of operations performed on the string s1 and the indices of '>' characters in s1. The function modifies the input string s1 by iterating over it from right to left, and for each character, it performs calculations based on the number of '>' characters to its right and left. The function returns the modified list, which represents the result of these calculations.
