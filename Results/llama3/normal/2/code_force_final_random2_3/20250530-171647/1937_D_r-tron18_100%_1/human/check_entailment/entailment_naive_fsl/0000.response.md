Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the rules of the pinball movement and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the number of seconds. `func_1` calculates the difference between the last element of the array and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the length of the array and `times` is the number of times the pinball moves. `func_2` calculates the number of seconds for each query by iterating over the string `s1` from right to left and using the `func_1` function to calculate the number of seconds for each query.

The program correctly handles the cases where the pinball moves to the left or right and inverts the character at the current cell. The program also correctly handles the cases where the pinball leaves the grid from the left or right border.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
