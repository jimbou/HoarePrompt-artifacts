Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `pre` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s1` (1-indexed), `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of `s1` is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where the second last element is modified, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1` which is either '<' or '>' depending on the second last character of `s1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s1` and its related variables `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, and `suffZero` remain unchanged. The list `ans` still has its second last element modified. The index `i` is still `n - 2`. The variable `el` is now assigned the value of the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, which can be either '<' or '>' depending on the second last character of `s1`.
