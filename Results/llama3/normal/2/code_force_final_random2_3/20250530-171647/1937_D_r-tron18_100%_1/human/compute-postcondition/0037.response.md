Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 with the last element removed, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n where the last element is modified, i is n - 3, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the last character of s1, ol is the number of '>' characters in s1 minus 1, zr is the number of elements in suffZero minus 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `totalOne` and `preOne`. The first line removes the last element from `preOne`, which is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in `s1`. The second line decrements `totalOne` by 1, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
