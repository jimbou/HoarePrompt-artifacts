Postcondition: ***s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 (1-indexed), totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0 if the last character of s1 is '>', otherwise it contains two elements: 0 and n, ans is a list of length n where the last element is modified, i is n - 1, el is either '<' or '>' depending on the last character of s1. If the last character of s1 is '>', totalOne is decreased by one, preOne has its last element removed, and the last element of ans is modified. If the last character of s1 is '<', the value at index i in ans is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 if zr is less than or equal to ol, otherwise the value at index i is zeroInd - oneInd.***
