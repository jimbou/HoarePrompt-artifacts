Output State: **`s` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing only "U" and "D", `num_up` is an integer between 0 and n (inclusive), representing the number of 'U's in string `s`.**

In this output state, the length of string `s` is still between 1 and 100, and it only contains the characters "U" and "D". The variable `num_up` has been assigned the count of 'U's in string `s`, which can be any integer between 0 and the length of `s` (inclusive).
