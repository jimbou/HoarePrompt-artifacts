Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The problem asks to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" as input. The function counts the number of "U"s in the string and returns 'YES' if the count is odd and 'NO' otherwise.

The reasoning behind this function is that if the number of "U"s is odd, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of "U"s. Since Bob cannot make a move that will leave Alice with an odd number of "U"s, Alice will eventually win the game. On the other hand, if the number of "U"s is even, Bob can always make a move that will leave Alice with an even number of "U"s, and Alice will eventually lose.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately determines who will win the game based on the initial configuration of the coins.

Correctness: **True**
