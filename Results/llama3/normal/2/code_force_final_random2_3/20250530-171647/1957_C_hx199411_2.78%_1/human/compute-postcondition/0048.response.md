Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 1, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer equal to `n` - 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7). The current value of `c` is equal to the current value of `r`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains a non-negative integer greater than 0, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `num` is incremented to 1, `i` remains 0, `m` is updated to `n` - 1, and `c` and `r` remain equal. The conditions for printing values and the initialization of the `dp` list also remain the same, with `m` updated to `n` - 1.
