The code prints the value of `dp[m]`, which is the `m`-th element of the `dp` list. 

The `dp` list is initialized with `m` + 1 elements, where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is calculated as (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7). 

This calculation is based on the values of the previous two elements in the `dp` list, and it is performed for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`. 

Therefore, the value of `dp[m]` is the result of this calculation for `j` = `m`, which depends on the values of `dp[m - 1]` and `dp[m - 2]`.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the m-th element of the dp list, calculated based on the values of dp[m - 1] and dp[m - 2])**
