Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers that were inputted from stdin, and stdin contains the remaining test cases minus three. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is either 3, 4 or 5, and either `num` is 3 and `c` is not equal to `r`, or `num` is 4 and `c` is equal to `r`, or `num` is 5 and `c` is not equal to `r`. Otherwise, `num` is either 6, 7 or 8, and either `num` is 6 and `c` is not equal to `r`, or `num` is 7 and `c` is equal to `r`, or `num` is 8 and `c` is not equal to `r`.***
