Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `num` is 0, `i` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus one**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of `c` and `r` from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. Since the input is consumed, the stdin now contains the remaining test cases minus one.
