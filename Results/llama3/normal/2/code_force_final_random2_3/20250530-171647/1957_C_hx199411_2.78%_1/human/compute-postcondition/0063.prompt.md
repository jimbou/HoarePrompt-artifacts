Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer, k is a non-negative integer, num is 0, i is equal to k if m is 0 or 1, otherwise i is equal to m, m is an integer equal to n - num, stdin is empty. If m is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If m is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If m is not 0 or 1, dp is a list of m + 1 elements initialized with 0, except dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for all integers j from 3 to m, dp[j] is (dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if c == r:
        num += 1
    else:
        num += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1, otherwise `num` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer and `k` must be greater than 1, `num` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1, otherwise `num` is 2 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 3 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer and `k` must be greater than 2, `num` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1, otherwise `num` is 2 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 3 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 4 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 5 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 6.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
