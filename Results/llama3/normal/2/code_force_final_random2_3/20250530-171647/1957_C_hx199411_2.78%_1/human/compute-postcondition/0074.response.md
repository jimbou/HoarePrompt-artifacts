The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If m is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer, num is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, i is equal to k, c is an integer, r is an integer, m is an integer equal to n minus num and m is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, dp is a list of m + 1 elements initialized with 0, except dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for all integers j from 3 to m, dp[j] is (dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than or equal to 3 and i is now 3. 
State: **t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer, num is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, i is equal to k and i is 3, c is an integer, r is an integer, m is an integer equal to n minus num and m is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1 and m is greater than or equal to 3, dp is a list of m + 1 elements initialized with 0, except dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for all integers j from 3 to m, dp[j] is (dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**
