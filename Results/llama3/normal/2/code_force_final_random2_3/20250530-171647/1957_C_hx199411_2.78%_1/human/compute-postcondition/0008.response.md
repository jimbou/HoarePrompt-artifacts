The value of `num` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `num` was 0, so the new value of `num` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `num` is 2, `i` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus one, and `c` is not equal to `r`.
