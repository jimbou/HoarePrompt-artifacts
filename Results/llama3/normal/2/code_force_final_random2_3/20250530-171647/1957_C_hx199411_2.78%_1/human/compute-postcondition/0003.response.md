To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `num` is 0. However, these states do not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `k` to be at least 1, and `i` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `num` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases**
