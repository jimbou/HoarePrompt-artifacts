Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `num` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, `i` is 5, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1 and `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is (`dp[2]` + (3 - 1) * `dp[2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7) and for all integers `j` from 4 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7) and `dp[4]` is (`dp[3]` + (4 - 1) * `dp[3]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7) and `dp[5]` is (`dp[4]` + (5 - 1) * `dp[4]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7) and `dp[6]` is (`dp[5]` + (6 - 1) * `dp[5]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7).**

The code updates the value of `dp[i]` where `i` is 5, using the formula (`dp[i - 1]` + (`i` - 1) * `dp[i - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Since `i` is 5, `dp[5]` is updated to (`dp[4]` + (5 - 1) * `dp[4]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7). The other variables remain unchanged.
