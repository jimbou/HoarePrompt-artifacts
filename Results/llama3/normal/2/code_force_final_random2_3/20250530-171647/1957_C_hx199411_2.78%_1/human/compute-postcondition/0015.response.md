The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `num` is either 2, 3 or 4, `c` and `r` are integers, and either `num` is 2 and `c` is not equal to `r`, or `num` is 3 and `c` is equal to `r`, or `num` is 4 and `c` is not equal to `r`, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus two.**
