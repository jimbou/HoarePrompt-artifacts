The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer and `k` must be greater than 1, `num` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1, otherwise `num` is 2.**
