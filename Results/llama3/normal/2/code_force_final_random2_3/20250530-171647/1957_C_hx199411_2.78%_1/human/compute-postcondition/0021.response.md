Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `num` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k`, `m` is an integer equal to `n - num`, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `m` is calculated by subtracting `num` from `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty as it was in the initial state.
