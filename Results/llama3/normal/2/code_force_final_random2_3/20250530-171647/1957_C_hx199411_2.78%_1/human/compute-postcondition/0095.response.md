Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 1, `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus 1 if `num` is 1, otherwise `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus 2, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7), stdin contains no input.**

The code has assigned the values of `c` and `r` from the input, but since stdin contains no input, the values of `c` and `r` are not changed. The other variables are not affected by the code.
