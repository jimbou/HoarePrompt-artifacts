Output State: **t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer, num is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, i is equal to k and i is 3, c is an integer, r is an integer, m is an integer equal to n minus num and m is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1 and m is greater than or equal to 3, dp is a list of m + 1 elements initialized with 0, except dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) and for all integers j from 4 to m, dp[j] is (dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**

In this output state, the value of dp[3] has been updated according to the given formula, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
