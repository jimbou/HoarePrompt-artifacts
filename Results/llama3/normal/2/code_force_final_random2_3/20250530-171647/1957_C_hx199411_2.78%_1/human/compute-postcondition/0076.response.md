To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Since `m` is not changed by the loop, its value remains the same.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `num` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, `i` is equal to `k` and `i` is 4, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1 and `m` is greater than or equal to 4, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is (`dp[2]` + (3 - 1) * `dp[2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7) and for all integers `j` from 4 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**
