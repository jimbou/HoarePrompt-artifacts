Output State: `t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `num` is an integer, `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7), `stdin` is empty.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `t` remains a non-negative integer decreased by 1 from its original value, `n`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged as integers, `i` equals `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 (excluding 0 and 1), and the list `dp` has its elements updated according to the loop's formula for all indices from 3 to `m`. The standard input remains empty.
