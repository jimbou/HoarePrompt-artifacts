The code snippet provided consists of four lines. The first line decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` is a positive integer, its new value will be a non-negative integer. The second line reads two space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. This operation consumes the next two integers from stdin, leaving the remaining test cases. The third line initializes a variable `num` to 0.

Output State: **t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, num is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases**
