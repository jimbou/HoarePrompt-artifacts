Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. It first calculates the number of rows and columns that are blocked by the k moves and the implied computer moves. Then, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining rows and columns.

The dynamic programming approach is correct because it considers all possible ways to place the remaining rooks. The base cases are handled correctly, and the recursive formula is correct. The program also correctly handles the case where there is only one row or column left, and the case where there are no rows or columns left.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of moves k is equal to the size of the chessboard n. In this case, there are no valid moves remaining, and the program correctly prints 0.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of moves k is greater than the size of the chessboard n. In this case, the program correctly prints 0, because there are no valid moves remaining.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of moves k is less than the size of the chessboard n. In this case, the program correctly calculates the number of possible configurations for the remaining rows and columns.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of moves k is equal to 0. In this case, the program correctly calculates the number of possible configurations for the entire chessboard.

The program also correctly handles the case where the size of the chessboard n is equal to 1. In this case, the program correctly prints 1, because there is only one possible configuration.

The program also correctly handles the case where the size of the chessboard n is equal to 2. In this case, the program correctly prints 3, because there are three possible configurations.

The program also correctly handles the case where the size of the chessboard n is greater than 2. In this case, the program correctly calculates the number of possible configurations for the remaining rows and columns.

Overall, the program correctly handles all possible cases, and the dynamic programming approach is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
