To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is at least 3, since the range starts from 3.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `c` is None, `r` is None, `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 and is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `stdin` contains no input.**
