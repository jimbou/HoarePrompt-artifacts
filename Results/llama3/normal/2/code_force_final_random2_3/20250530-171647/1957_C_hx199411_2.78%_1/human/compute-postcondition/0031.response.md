To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is greater than or equal to 3, since the range starts from 3. 

Since `i` is equal to `k` and `k` is a non-negative integer, we can adjust `i` to be equal to 3, which is the starting value of the range. 

The state of `m` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 3, so that the loop can execute.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `num`, and `dp` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `num` is an integer, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1 and `dp[2]` is 3, `stdin` is empty**
