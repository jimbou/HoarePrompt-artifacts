Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `num` is 1, `i` is 0, `c` is an integer equal to `r`, `r` is an integer equal to `c`, and stdin contains the remaining test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `num` being 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of `t` is still a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is still an integer, `k` is still at least 1, `i` is still 0, and `c` and `r` are still equal to each other. Additionally, stdin still contains the remaining test cases minus one.
