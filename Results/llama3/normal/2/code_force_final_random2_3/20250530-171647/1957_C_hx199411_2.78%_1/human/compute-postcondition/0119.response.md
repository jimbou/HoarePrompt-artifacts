Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 4, `c` is None, `r` is None, `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4 and is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 15, and `dp[4]` is (15 + 3 * 3 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) which is 45, and for all integers `j` from 5 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[4]` has been updated to 45, which is the result of the expression `(dp[4 - 1] + (4 - 1) * dp[4 - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
