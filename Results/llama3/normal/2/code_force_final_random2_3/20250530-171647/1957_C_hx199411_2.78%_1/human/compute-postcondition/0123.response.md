The code prints the value of `dp[m]`, which is the `m`-th element of the `dp` list.

Based on the precondition, we know that `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements initialized with 0, except for `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3. For all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.

Since `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num` and is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1, we can conclude that `m` is at least 2.

Therefore, the value of `dp[m]` will be the result of the calculation `(dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, where `dp[m - 1]` and `dp[m - 2]` are the values of the previous two elements in the `dp` list.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the m-th element of the dp list, calculated using the formula (dp[m - 1] + (m - 1) * dp[m - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7))**
