Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `num` is an integer, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[3]` is 9, `stdin` is empty**

Explanation: The value of `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since `i` is 3, `dp[3]` is calculated as `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Substituting the known values, `dp[3]` becomes `(3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which equals 9. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
