Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `num` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num`. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and `dp[m]` is printed, `dp[m]` is the `m`th element of the `dp` list which is (`dp[m - 1]` + (`m` - 1) * `dp[m - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1, otherwise `num` is 2 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 3 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 4 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 5 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 6. stdin contains no input.***
