Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer and `k` must be greater than 1, `num` is either 3 or 4, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 3, otherwise `num` is 4.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 2, so it is now either 3 or 4. The value of `m` is still an integer equal to `n` minus `num`, but since `num` has changed, `m` may also have changed. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
