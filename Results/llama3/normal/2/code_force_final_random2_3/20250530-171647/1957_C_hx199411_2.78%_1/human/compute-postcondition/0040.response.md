Output: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `num` is an integer, `i` is `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7), `stdin` is empty, and the value of `dp[m]` which is (`dp[m - 1]` + (`m` - 1) * `dp[m - 2]` * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) is being printed**
