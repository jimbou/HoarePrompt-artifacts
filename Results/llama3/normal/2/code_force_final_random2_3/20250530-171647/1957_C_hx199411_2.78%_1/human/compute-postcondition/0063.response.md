Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `num` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, `i` is equal to `k`, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1, otherwise `num` is 2 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 3 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 4 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 5 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 6.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The variable `t` remains a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and is greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains an integer.
- The variable `num` can take any value from 1 to 6, depending on the number of times the loop iterates and the values of `c` and `r`.
- The variable `i` is equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num`.
- The variables `c` and `r` are integers, but their values are not specified.
- The standard input (stdin) contains no input.
- Depending on the value of `m`, either the value 0, the number 1, or a list `dp` with calculated values is being printed.
