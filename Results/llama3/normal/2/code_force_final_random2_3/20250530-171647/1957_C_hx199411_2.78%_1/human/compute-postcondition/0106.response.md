Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` is None, `r` is None, `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been updated to be equal to `n` minus `num`, which is a specific combination of variables. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `dp` still has `m + 1` elements, but its length has changed due to the update of `m`. The values of `dp` are still calculated based on the recurrence relation, but the upper limit of the recurrence has changed to the new value of `m`.
