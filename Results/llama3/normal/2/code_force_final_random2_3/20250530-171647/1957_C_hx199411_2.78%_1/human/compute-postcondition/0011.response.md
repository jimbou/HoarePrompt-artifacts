Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `num` is either 1 or 2, `c` and `r` are integers, and either `num` is 1 and `c` is equal to `r`, or `num` is 2 and `c` is not equal to `r`, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are updated to the two integers read from the input. The condition on `num` and the relationship between `c` and `r` are still valid, but the specific values of `num`, `c`, and `r` are now determined by the input. The stdin now contains the remaining test cases minus two, as two integers have been read from the input.
