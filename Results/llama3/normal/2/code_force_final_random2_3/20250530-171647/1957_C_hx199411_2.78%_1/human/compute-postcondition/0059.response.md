Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer and `k` must be greater than 2, `num` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 1, otherwise `num` is 2 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 3 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 4.**

The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` attempts to read two integers from the standard input and assign them to `c` and `r`. However, since the initial state specifies that stdin contains no input, this operation will result in an error or exception, as there is no input to read. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
