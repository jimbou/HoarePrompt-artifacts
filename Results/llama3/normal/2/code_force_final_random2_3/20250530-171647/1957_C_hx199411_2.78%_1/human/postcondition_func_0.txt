This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a positive integer n and a non-negative integer k, followed by k pairs of integers. It calculates the number of remaining elements (m) after processing the pairs, and then prints the result based on the value of m. If m is 0, it prints 0. If m is 1, it prints 1. If m is greater than 1, it calculates and prints the m-th element of a dynamic programming sequence (dp) modulo 10^9 + 7, where dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for i >= 3. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.
