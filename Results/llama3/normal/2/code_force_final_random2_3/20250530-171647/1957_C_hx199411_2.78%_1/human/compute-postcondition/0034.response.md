Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `num` is an integer, `i` is 4, `m` is an integer greater than 4 and not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 9, and `dp[4]` is (3 + 3 * 9 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 57 % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 57, `stdin` is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged. The list `dp` has been updated with a new value at index 4, which is calculated using the previous values of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]`. The stdin remains empty.
