Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7), stdin contains no input. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 2 and `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus 1. Otherwise, `num` is 4 and `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus 2, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers from the input, but since stdin contains no input, `c` and `r` are assigned None.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `dp` remain unchanged. The values of `c` and `r` are assigned None because there is no input in stdin. The values of `num` and `m` depend on the values of `c` and `r`, but since `c` and `r` are None, `num` and `m` cannot be determined.
