The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of t needed to have been equal or greater than 1 and t currently must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1 and t currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `num` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 0 or 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is an integer equal to `n - num`, stdin is empty. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7).**
