Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, num is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if c == r:
        num += 1
    else:
        num += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus one, and either `num` is 1 and `c` is equal to `r`, or `num` is 2 and `c` is not equal to `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `num` is either 2, 3 or 4, `c` and `r` are integers, and either `num` is 2 and `c` is not equal to `r`, or `num` is 3 and `c` is equal to `r`, or `num` is 4 and `c` is not equal to `r`, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus two.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers that were inputted from stdin, and stdin contains the remaining test cases minus three. If `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is either 3, 4 or 5, and either `num` is 3 and `c` is not equal to `r`, or `num` is 4 and `c` is equal to `r`, or `num` is 5 and `c` is not equal to `r`. Otherwise, `num` is either 6, 7 or 8, and either `num` is 6 and `c` is not equal to `r`, or `num` is 7 and `c` is equal to `r`, or `num` is 8 and `c` is not equal to `r`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
