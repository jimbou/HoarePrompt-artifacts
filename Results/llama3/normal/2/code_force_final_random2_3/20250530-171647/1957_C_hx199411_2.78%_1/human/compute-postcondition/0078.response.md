To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4 and `m` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m + 1`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 5 at the start of the next iteration.

The state of `m` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, such as `t`, `n`, `num`, `c`, `r`, and `dp`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `num` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, `i` is 5, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1 and `m` is greater than or equal to 5, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is (`dp[2]` + (3 - 1) * `dp[2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7) and for all integers `j` from 4 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7) and `dp[4]` is (`dp[3]` + (4 - 1) * `dp[3]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7) and `dp[5]` is (`dp[4]` + (5 - 1) * `dp[4]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7)**
