The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to 0 and not equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `num` is an integer, `i` is 4, `m` is an integer greater than 4 and not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[3]` is 9, `stdin` is empty**
