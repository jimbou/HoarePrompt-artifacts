Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 3 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` is None, `r` is None, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7), `num` is either 3 or 5, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1, resulting in either 3 or 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and stdin still contains no input.
