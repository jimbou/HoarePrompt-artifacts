Output State: **t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer, num is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, i is equal to k, c is an integer, r is an integer, m is an integer equal to n minus num and m is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, dp is a list of m + 1 elements initialized with 0, except dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for all integers j from 3 to m, dp[j] is (dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).**

The code snippet provided initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0, except for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`, which are set to 1 and 3, respectively. The rest of the list is calculated using the formula `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`. This calculation is based on the previous values of `dp[j - 1]` and `dp[j - 2]`, and the result is taken modulo `(10^9 + 7)` to prevent overflow.

The initial state of the variables remains unchanged, except for `dp`, which is now initialized with the calculated values. The value of `t` is still a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and greater than 0. The values of `n`, `num`, `i`, `c`, `r`, and `m` remain the same as in the initial state.
