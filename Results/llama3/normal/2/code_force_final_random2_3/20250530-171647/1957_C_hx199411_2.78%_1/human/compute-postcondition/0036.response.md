Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `num` is an integer, `i` is 5, `m` is an integer greater than 5 and not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 9, `dp[4]` is (3 + 3 * 9 * 2) % (10**9 + 7), and `dp[5]` is (dp[4] + 4 * dp[3] * 2) % (10**9 + 7).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged. The list `dp` has been updated with a new value at index 5, which is calculated using the values at indices 4 and 3, and the modulus operator. The other elements of the list `dp` remain the same.
