The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m` + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3 and is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than or equal to 4.
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 4, `c` is None, `r` is None, `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4 and is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and `dp[3]` is (3 + 2 * 3 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) which is 15, stdin contains no input.**
