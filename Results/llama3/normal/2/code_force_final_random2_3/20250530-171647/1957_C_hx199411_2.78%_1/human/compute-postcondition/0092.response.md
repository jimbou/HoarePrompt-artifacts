Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `num` is 2, `i` is 0, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus 2, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7), stdin contains no input, and `c` and `r` are integers. Additionally, `c` is not equal to `r`.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to 2, and the value of `m` has been updated to `n` minus 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `dp` still has the same values, but its length is now `m` + 1, where `m` is `n` minus 2. The stdin still contains no input. The relationship between `c` and `r` remains the same, i.e., `c` is not equal to `r`.
