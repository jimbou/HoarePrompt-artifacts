Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `num` is an integer, `i` is equal to `k` if `m` is 1, otherwise `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is an integer equal to `n - num` and not equal to 0, stdin is empty, and if `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7).***
