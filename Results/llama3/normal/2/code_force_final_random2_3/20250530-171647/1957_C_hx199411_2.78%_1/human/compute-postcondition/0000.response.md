The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains an integer `n` and an integer `k` on the first line, the first integer is assigned to `t`. Therefore, `t` is equal to the number of test cases. The stdin now contains the remaining test cases.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**
