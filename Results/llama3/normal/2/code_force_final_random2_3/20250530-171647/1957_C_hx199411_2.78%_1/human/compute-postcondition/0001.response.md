To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the condition in the `while` loop, which is simply `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero.

Given that `t` is a positive integer, this condition is already met. There is no need to adjust the state of `t` because being a positive integer already guarantees that the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, the state does not need any adjustments to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**
