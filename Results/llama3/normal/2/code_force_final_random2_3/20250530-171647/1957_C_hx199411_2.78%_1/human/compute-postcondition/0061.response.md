Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 2 and `t` currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer and `k` must be greater than 2, `num` is either 3, 4, 5 or 6, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num`, `c` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `m` is 0, the value 0 is being printed. If `m` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `m` is not 0 or 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7). Additionally, if `c` is equal to `r`, then `num` is 3, otherwise `num` is 4 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 5 if `c` is not equal to `r` then `num` is 6.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `num` has been incremented by 2, resulting in a new value that can be either 3, 4, 5, or 6. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `m` and `dp` still apply. The value of `num` is now dependent on the comparison between `c` and `r`, with `num` being 3 if they are equal, and 4, 5, or 6 if they are not equal.
