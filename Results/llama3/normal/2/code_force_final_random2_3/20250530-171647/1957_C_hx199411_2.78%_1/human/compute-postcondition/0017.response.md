Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `num` is either 3, 4 or 5, `c` and `r` are integers that were inputted from stdin, and either `num` is 3 and `c` is not equal to `r`, or `num` is 4 and `c` is equal to `r`, or `num` is 5 and `c` is not equal to `r`, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 3, 4, or 5. The conditions related to `num`, `c`, and `r` have also been updated accordingly. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
