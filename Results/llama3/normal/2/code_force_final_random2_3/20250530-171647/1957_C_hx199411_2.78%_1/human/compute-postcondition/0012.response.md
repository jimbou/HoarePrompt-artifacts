The value of `num` is incremented by 1. The value of `num` can be 1 or 2, so the value of `num` is 2 or 3. However, since `num` can only be 1 or 2, the value of `num` is 2 or 3 is incorrect and the correct value is 2 or 3 is out of the range of `num` so the value of `num` is 2 or it is out of the range of `num`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `num` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers, and either `num` is 1 and `c` is equal to `r`, or `num` is 2 and `c` is not equal to `r` is incorrect and the correct statement is `num` is 2 and `c` is not equal to `r`, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus two.

Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `num` is 2, `c` and `r` are integers, and `num` is 2 and `c` is not equal to `r`, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus two.**
