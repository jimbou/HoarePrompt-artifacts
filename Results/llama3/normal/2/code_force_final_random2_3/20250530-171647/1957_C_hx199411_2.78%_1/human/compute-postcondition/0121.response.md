Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t currently must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 5, `c` is None, `r` is None, `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 5 and is not equal to 0 and is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 15, `dp[4]` is 45, and `dp[5]` is (`dp[4]` + (`i` - 1) * `dp[3]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7) which is (45 + 4 * 15 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) which is 105, and for all integers `j` from 6 to `m`, `dp[j]` is (`dp[j - 1]` + (`j` - 1) * `dp[j - 2]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `dp[5]` has been updated to 105, which is the result of the calculation (`dp[4]` + (`i` - 1) * `dp[3]` * 2) % (10^9 + 7). All other variables remain unchanged.
