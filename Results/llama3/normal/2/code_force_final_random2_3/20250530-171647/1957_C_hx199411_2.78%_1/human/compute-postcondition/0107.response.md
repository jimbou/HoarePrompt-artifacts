Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 3 and the current value of `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` is None, `r` is None, `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer equal to `n` minus `num` and the current value of `m` is 0, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for all integers `j` from 3 to `m`, `dp[j]` is `(dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, stdin contains no input.***
