To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `i` is equal to `k`, we can adjust `i` to be 0 (the starting value for the range) and `k` to be greater than 0.

State: **t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0, num is 0, i is 0, c is an integer, r is an integer, m is an integer equal to n minus num, dp is a list of m + 1 elements initialized with 0, except dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for all integers j from 3 to m, dp[j] is (dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), and dp[m] is printed, stdin contains no input.**
