Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `num` is either 2, 3 or 4, `c` and `r` are integers that were inputted from stdin, and either `num` is 2 and `c` is not equal to `r`, or `num` is 3 and `c` is equal to `r`, or `num` is 4 and `c` is not equal to `r`, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the values of `c` and `r` have been updated to the integers inputted from stdin, and the remaining test cases in stdin have been reduced by one. The other variables remain unchanged.
