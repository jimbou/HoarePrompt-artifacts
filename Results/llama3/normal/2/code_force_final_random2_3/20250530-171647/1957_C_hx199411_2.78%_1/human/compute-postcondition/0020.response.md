Output State: **t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, k is a non-negative integer, num is an integer, i is equal to k, stdin is empty**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that t remains a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, n remains an integer, k becomes a non-negative integer (since the loop will have executed k times), num becomes an integer (since it was incremented by 1 or 2 in each iteration), i becomes equal to k (since the loop iterates k times), and stdin becomes empty (since all remaining test cases would have been read).
