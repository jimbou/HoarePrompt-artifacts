To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4 and `m` is greater than 4. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 5. The value of `m` remains the same.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `num` is an integer, `i` is 5, `m` is an integer greater than 5 and not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m` + 1 elements initialized with 0, except `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 9, and `dp[4]` is (3 + 3 * 9 * 2) % (10**9 + 7)**
