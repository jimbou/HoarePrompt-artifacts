Postcondition: ***t is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 3 and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0, num is 0, i is 0, c is an integer equal to r, r is an integer, m is an integer equal to n minus num, dp is a list of m + 1 elements initialized with 0, except dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, and for all integers j from 3 to m, dp[j] is (dp[j - 1] + (j - 1) * dp[j - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7), stdin contains no input.***
