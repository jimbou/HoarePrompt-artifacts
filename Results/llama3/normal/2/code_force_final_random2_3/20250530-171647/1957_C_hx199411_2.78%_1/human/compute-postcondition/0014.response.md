Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `num` is either 2, 3 or 4, `c` and `r` are integers, and either `num` is 2 and `c` is not equal to `r`, or `num` is 3 and `c` is equal to `r`, or `num` is 4 and `c` is not equal to `r`, stdin contains the remaining test cases minus two.***
