Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with n-1 keys, each containing a list of adjacent nodes, start is an integer, n is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n-2, u and v are integers, nodes[u] is a list containing all adjacent nodes of u, nodes[v] is a list containing all adjacent nodes of v, leaves is a deque containing all nodes in the tree that have only one adjacent node, and moves is the output of func_1(nodes, start).**

The code snippet assigns an integer value from the input to the variable `start`. The function `func_1(nodes, start)` is then called with the updated `start` value and the `nodes` dictionary, and its output is assigned to the variable `moves`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
