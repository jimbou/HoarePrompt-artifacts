Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary with n-1 keys, each containing a list of adjacent nodes, `start` is a node in the tree, `n` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `u` and `v` are integers, `nodes[u]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `u`, `nodes[v]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `v`, and `leaves` is a deque containing all nodes in the tree that have only one adjacent node.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be that the `leaves` deque will contain all nodes in the tree that have only one adjacent node. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.
