To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, `n` must still be greater than 1 to satisfy the loop condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **nodes is a dictionary with two keys u and v, each containing a list with the other key as its only element, start is a node in the tree, n is greater than 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, stdin contains no input, i is 1, u and v are integers**
