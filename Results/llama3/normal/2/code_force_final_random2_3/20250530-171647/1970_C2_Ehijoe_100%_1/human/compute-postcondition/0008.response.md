Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary with n-1 keys, each containing a list of adjacent nodes, `start` is a node in the tree, `n` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `u` and `v` are integers, `nodes[u]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `u`, `nodes[v]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `v`, and `leaves` is an empty deque.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `leaves` which is an empty deque. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains no input. The dictionary `nodes`, the node `start`, the integer `n`, the list `edges`, the boolean `empty`, the integer `i`, and the integers `u` and `v` retain their initial values.
