Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nodes` is a dictionary with n-1 keys, each containing a list of adjacent nodes, `start` is a node in the tree, `n` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `u` and `v` are integers, `nodes[u]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `u`, `nodes[v]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `v`, and `leaves` is an empty deque.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`nodes` is a dictionary with at least 1 key, `key` is one of the keys in the `nodes` dictionary, `start` is a node in the tree, `n` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `u` and `v` are integers, `nodes[u]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `u`, `nodes[v]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `v`. If the length of the list of adjacent nodes of `key` is 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the node `key`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`nodes` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, `key` is one of the keys in the `nodes` dictionary, `start` is a node in the tree, `n` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `u` and `v` are integers, `nodes[u]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `u`, `nodes[v]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `v`. If the length of the list of adjacent nodes of `key` is 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the node `key` and the newly appended node `key`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `leaves`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`nodes` is a dictionary with at least 3 keys, `key` is one of the keys in the `nodes` dictionary, `start` is a node in the tree, `n` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `u` and `v` are integers, `nodes[u]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `u`, `nodes[v]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `v`. If the length of the list of adjacent nodes of `key` is 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the node `key` and the newly appended node `key`. Otherwise, `leaves` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
