Postcondition: ***`nodes` is a dictionary with at least 3 keys, `key` is one of the keys in the `nodes` dictionary, `start` is a node in the tree, `n` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `u` and `v` are integers, `nodes[u]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `u`, `nodes[v]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `v`. If the length of the list of adjacent nodes of `key` is 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the node `key` and the newly appended node `key`. Otherwise, `leaves` remains unchanged.***
