To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range function will generate numbers from 0 to `n-2`. 

State: **nodes is an empty dictionary, start is a node in the tree, n is greater than 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, stdin contains no input, i is 0**
