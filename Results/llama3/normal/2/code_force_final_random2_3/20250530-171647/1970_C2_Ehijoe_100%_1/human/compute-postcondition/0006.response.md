Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with two keys u and v, each containing a list with the other key as its only element, start is a node in the tree, n is greater than 2, edges is an empty list, empty is True, stdin contains no input, i is 2, u and v are integers, nodes[u] is a list containing v, nodes[v] is a list containing u**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line assigns the values of `u` and `v` from the input to the variables `u` and `v`. Since `stdin` contains no input, this line does not modify any variables. The second line appends `v` to the list `nodes[u]`, and the third line appends `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. 

Since `nodes[u]` is a list containing `v`, and `nodes[v]` is a list containing `u`, after the execution of the code, `nodes[u]` will be a list containing `v` and `v`, and `nodes[v]` will be a list containing `u` and `u`. No other variables are affected.
