Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, `key` is one of the keys in the `nodes` dictionary, `start` is a node in the tree, `n` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `u` and `v` are integers, `nodes[u]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `u`, `nodes[v]` is a list containing all adjacent nodes of `v`. If the length of the list of adjacent nodes of `key` is 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the node `key` and the newly appended node `key`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The `leaves` deque now contains the node `key` that was appended to it, in addition to the node `key` that was already in it if the length of the list of adjacent nodes of `key` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
