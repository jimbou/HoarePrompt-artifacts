If the current node is not the parent node, the last element of `distances` is the opposite of the return value of `func_1(nodes, node, start)`.

    #The program returns True if at least one of the boolean values in the `distances` list is True, which means that the return value of `func_1(nodes, node, start)` is False for at least one node that is not the parent node, otherwise it returns False.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a node in a tree has at least one child node that does not have a certain property, as determined by the function `func_1`. It takes as input a tree represented as an adjacency list (`nodes`), the current node (`start`), and the parent node of the current node (`parent`). If the current node has only one neighbor and that neighbor is its parent, the function returns False. Otherwise, it iterates over the neighbors of the current node, excluding the parent node, and checks the return value of `func_1` for each neighbor. If any of these return values are False, the function returns True. If all return values are True, the function returns False.
