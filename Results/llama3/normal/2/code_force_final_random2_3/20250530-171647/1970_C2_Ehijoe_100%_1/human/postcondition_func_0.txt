This function determines whether a node in a tree has at least one child node that does not have a certain property, as determined by the function `func_1`. It takes as input a tree represented as an adjacency list (`nodes`), the current node (`start`), and the parent node of the current node (`parent`). If the current node has only one neighbor and that neighbor is its parent, the function returns False. Otherwise, it iterates over the neighbors of the current node, excluding the parent node, and checks the return value of `func_1` for each neighbor. If any of these return values are False, the function returns True. If all return values are True, the function returns False.
