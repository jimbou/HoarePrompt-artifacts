The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `b`, where `i` is 2. Since `i` is 2, it is out of range for the list `b` because list indices in Python start at 0 and go up to `len(list) - 1`. The list `b` has at least 2 elements, so the valid indices for `b` are 0 and 1.

Since `i` is 2, which is out of range for the list `b`, the code will raise an `IndexError` exception when trying to access `b[i]`.

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
