Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 1. If the second element of `a` is greater than the second element of `b`, then the second element of `a` is swapped with the second element of `b`, and the second element of `b` is swapped with the second element of `a`.***
