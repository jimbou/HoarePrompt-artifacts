Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with at least 2 elements, where the third element is swapped with the third element of b, b is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, where the third element is swapped with the third element of a, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, i is 2, f is 1.**

In this output state, the initial lists `a` and `b` have their third elements swapped, as indicated by the line `a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The variable `f` is assigned the value 1. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing t-1 pairs of integers x and y.
