To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`. The loop will execute if `b` has at least one element. Since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to 0, which is the first index of the list `b`.

State: **`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least `i` elements, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers that must have at least 1 element, `f` is 1, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 0, all elements of the list `a` have been printed, and a new line is printed**
