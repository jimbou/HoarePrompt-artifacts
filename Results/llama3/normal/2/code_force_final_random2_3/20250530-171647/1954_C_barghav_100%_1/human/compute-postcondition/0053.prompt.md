Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least `i` elements, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `f` is 1, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, all elements of the list `a` have been printed, and a new line is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(b)):
    print(b[i], end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least `i` elements, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers that must have at least 1 element, `f` is 1, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 0, all elements of the list `a` have been printed, and a new line is printed, and the first element of the list `b` which is `b[0]` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least `i` elements, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `f` is 1, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 1, all elements of the list `a` have been printed, and a new line is printed, and the first element of the list `b` which is `b[0]` is printed, and the second element of the list `b` which is `b[1]` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `f` is 1, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 2, all elements of the list `a` have been printed, and a new line is printed, and the first element of the list `b` which is `b[0]` is printed, and the second element of the list `b` which is `b[1]` is printed, and the third element of the list `b` which is `b[2]` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
