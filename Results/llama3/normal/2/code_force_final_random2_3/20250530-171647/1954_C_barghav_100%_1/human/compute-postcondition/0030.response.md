Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 2. If `f` is 0, then if the third element of `a` is greater than the third element of `b`, the third elements of `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `f` is not 0, then if `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, the third elements of `a` and `b` are swapped and `f` is 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `f` is 1. Otherwise, no change is made to `f`.***
