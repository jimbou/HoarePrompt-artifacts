Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: `a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `f` is 1, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: `a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least `i` elements, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `f` is 1, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and all elements of the list `a` have been printed
    print()
    #This is printed: a newline (empty line)
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: `a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least `i` elements, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers that must have at least `i` elements, `f` is 1, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, all elements of the list `a` have been printed, and a new line is printed, and all elements of the list `b` have been printed.
    print()
    #This is printed: a new line

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two pairs of integers as input from the standard input, compares them digit by digit, and prints the digits of the larger number first, followed by the digits of the smaller number. If the numbers are equal, it prints the digits of the first number first. The function then prints a newline character after printing each number. The function repeats this process for all pairs of integers in the input, which is specified by an integer t at the beginning of the input.
