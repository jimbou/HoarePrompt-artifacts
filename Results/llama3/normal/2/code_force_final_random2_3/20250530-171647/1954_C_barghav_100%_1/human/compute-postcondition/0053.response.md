Output State: **`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least `i` elements, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers that must have at least `i` elements, `f` is 1, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, all elements of the list `a` have been printed, and a new line is printed, and all elements of the list `b` have been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` remains unchanged, the list `b` has been fully printed, and the index `i` has reached the length of `b`. The other variables, `f` and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
