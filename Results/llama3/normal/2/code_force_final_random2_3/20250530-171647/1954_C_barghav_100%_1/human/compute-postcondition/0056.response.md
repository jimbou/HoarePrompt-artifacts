Functionality: **This function takes two pairs of integers as input from the standard input, compares them digit by digit, and prints the digits of the larger number first, followed by the digits of the smaller number. If the numbers are equal, it prints the digits of the first number first. The function then prints a newline character after printing each number. The function repeats this process for all pairs of integers in the input, which is specified by an integer t at the beginning of the input.**
