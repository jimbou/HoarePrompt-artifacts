To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `i` is equal to the length of `a`, we need to adjust `i` to be less than the length of `a` for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `f` is 1, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is less than the length of `a`**
