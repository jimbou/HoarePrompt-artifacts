The code prints the element at index `i` of the list `a`, where `i` is less than the length of `a` and is one more than its previous value, and `a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers that must have at least 2 elements.

Output: **the (i+1)th digit of the first pair of integers (where i is less than the length of a and is one more than its previous value)**
