Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of digits from the first pair of integers, b is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, f is 0, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if f == 0:
        if a[i] < b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
            f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            f = 1
    elif a[i] > b[i]:
        a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 0. If `a` is less than `b` at index `i`, then the values at index `i` of `a` and `b` are swapped and `f` is 1. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` at index `i`, then `f` is 1 if `a` is greater than `b` at index `i`, otherwise `f` remains unchanged. If `f` is not equal to 0, then if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then the current value of `a[i]` is less than the current value of `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 1. If `f` is 0, then if the element at index 1 of `a` is less than the element at index 1 of `b`, the elements at index 1 of `a` and `b` are swapped and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged and if the first digit of `a` is greater than the first digit of `b`, then `f` is set to 1. If `f` is not 0, then if the second element of `a` is greater than the second element of `b`, the second element of `a` is swapped with the second element of `b`, and the second element of `b` is swapped with the second element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 2. If `f` is 0, then if the third element of `a` is greater than the third element of `b`, the third elements of `a` and `b` are swapped. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `f` is not 0, then if `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, the third elements of `a` and `b` are swapped and `f` is 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `f` is 1. Otherwise, no change is made to `f`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
