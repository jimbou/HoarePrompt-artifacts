Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 1. If the element at index 1 of `a` is less than the element at index 1 of `b`, then the elements at index 1 of `a` and `b` are swapped and `f` is set to 1. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged and if the first digit of `a` is greater than the first digit of `b`, then `f` is set to 1.***
