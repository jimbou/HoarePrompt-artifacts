Output State: **`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with at least 2 elements, where the third element is swapped with the third element of `b`, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, where the third element is swapped with the third element of `a`, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated such that their third elements (at index 2) have been swapped. The rest of the elements in `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains 2, and the contents of `stdin` are unaffected.
