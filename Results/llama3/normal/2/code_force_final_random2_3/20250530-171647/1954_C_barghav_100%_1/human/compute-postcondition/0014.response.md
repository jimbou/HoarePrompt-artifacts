Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of digits from the first pair of integers with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of digits from the second pair of integers, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `i` is 0. If `a` is less than `b` at index `i`, then the values at index `i` of `a` and `b` are swapped and `f` is 1. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` at index `i`, then `f` is 1 if `a` is greater than `b` at index `i`, otherwise `f` remains unchanged. If `f` is not equal to 0, then if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then the current value of `a[i]` is less than the current value of `b[i]`.***
