The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, n and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n` and `k`. If `i` is less than `n - k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than `k`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `k + 2`.
State: **`n` is greater than `k + 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input. If lista_A[0] is less than lista_B[0] and lista_A[1] is less than lista_B[1], then pref is equal to lista_A[0] + lista_A[1] and soma_b is 0. If lista_A[0] is less than lista_B[0] but lista_A[1] is not less than lista_B[1], then pref is equal to lista_A[0] and soma_b is equal to lista_B[0] + lista_B[1]. If lista_A[0] is not less than lista_B[0], then pref is 0 and soma_b is equal to lista_B[0] + lista_B[1].**
