Output State: **`numero_testes` is at least `x + 2`, `func_1()` has been executed again, `stdin` contains an unspecified number of lines of input that will be processed by `func_1()`**.

In this output state, the value of `numero_testes` remains the same, as it is not affected by the execution of `func_1()`. The function `func_1()` has been executed again, and the `stdin` still contains an unspecified number of lines of input that will be processed by `func_1()`.
