Output State: **n is greater than or equal to k + 1, k is a positive integer, i is n - k + 2, lista_A is a list of n positive integers, lista_B is a list of n positive integers, stdin contains no input, pref is either the sum of all elements in lista_A, or 0, or the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B plus 2 * lista_B[i], and resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `pref` remains the same as it was before the code execution, which could be the sum of all elements in `lista_A`, 0, or the sum of all elements in `lista_A` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the sum of all elements in `lista_B` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`. The value of `soma_b` is updated to include an additional `lista_B[i]`, making it the sum of all elements in `lista_B` plus 2 times `lista_B[i]`. The value of `resultado` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`.
