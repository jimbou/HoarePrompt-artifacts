To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `numero_testes`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `numero_testes`. If `numero_testes` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to specify its value.

State: **`numero_testes` is at least 1, stdin contains an unspecified number of lines of input that will be processed by func_1()**
