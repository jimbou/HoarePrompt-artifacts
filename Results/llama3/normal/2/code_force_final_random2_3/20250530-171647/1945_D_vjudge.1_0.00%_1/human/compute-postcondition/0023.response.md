Output State: **n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, i is n - 1, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input, pref is either the sum of all elements in lista_A, or 0, or the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B, and resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable i has reached its final value of n - 1, and the variable soma_b has accumulated the sum of all elements in lista_B. The variable resultado has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and the sum of pref, soma_b, and the last element of lista_A. The other variables remain unchanged.
