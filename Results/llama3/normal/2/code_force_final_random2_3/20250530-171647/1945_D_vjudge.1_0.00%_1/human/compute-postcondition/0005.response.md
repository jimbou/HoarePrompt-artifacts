The only variable in the loop head is `numero_testes`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `numero_testes`. If `numero_testes` is greater than the current iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numero_testes` is at least `x + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `numero_testes` must be at least `x + 3`.

State: **`numero_testes` is at least `x + 3`, `func_1()` has been executed again, `stdin` contains an unspecified number of lines of input that will be processed by `func_1()`**
