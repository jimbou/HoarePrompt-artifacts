According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`. If `n - k` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, which ensures that `n - k` is at least 0. However, to guarantee that the loop will execute, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be equal to `n - k`, which is the starting value of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - k`, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input, pref is either the sum of all elements in lista_A, or 0, or the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A, soma_b is either 0, or the sum of all elements in lista_B, and resultado is positive infinity**
