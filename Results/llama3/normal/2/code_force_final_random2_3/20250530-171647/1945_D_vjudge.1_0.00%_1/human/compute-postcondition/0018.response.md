Output State: **n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, i is n - k, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input, pref is either the sum of all elements in lista_A, or 0, or the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A, soma_b is either the sum of all elements in lista_B, or the sum of all elements in lista_B plus lista_B[i], and resultado is either positive infinity, or the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i].**

In this output state, the value of `n`, `k`, `i`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B` remain unchanged. The value of `pref` remains the same as it was not modified by the code. The value of `soma_b` is either the original sum of all elements in `lista_B` or the original sum plus `lista_B[i]`, depending on its initial value. The value of `resultado` is either its original positive infinity value or the minimum of its original value and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`.
