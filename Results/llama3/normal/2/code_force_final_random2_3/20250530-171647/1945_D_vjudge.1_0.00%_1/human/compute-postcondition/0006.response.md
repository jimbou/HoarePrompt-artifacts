Output State: **`numero_testes` is at least `x + 2`, `func_1()` has been executed again, `stdin` contains an unspecified number of lines of input that will be processed by `func_1()`**

In this output state, the value of `numero_testes` has been decreased by 1 because `func_1()` has been executed again, but it is still at least `x + 2`. The function `func_1()` has been executed again, and the stdin still contains an unspecified number of lines of input that will be processed by `func_1()`.
