Output State: **`numero_testes` is at least 1, stdin contains an unspecified number of lines of input that will be processed by func_1() and func_1() has been executed.**

The value of `numero_testes` is not affected by the execution of `func_1()`, so it remains at least 1. The stdin still contains an unspecified number of lines of input that will be processed by `func_1()`. The function `func_1()` has been executed, but its specific effects on the program state are unknown, so we simply note that it has been executed.
