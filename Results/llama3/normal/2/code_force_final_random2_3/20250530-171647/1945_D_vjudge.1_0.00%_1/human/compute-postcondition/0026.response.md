Functionality: **This function calculates the minimum possible sum of a subset of elements from two lists, lista_A and lista_B, based on certain conditions. It takes as input two positive integers, n and k, and two lists of n positive integers each, representing the values a_i and b_i respectively. The function first processes the lists to determine the sum of elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B and the sum of elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A. Then, it calculates the minimum possible sum by considering the last k elements of lista_A and the sum of elements in lista_B. The function returns the minimum possible sum.**
