Output State: **`numero_testes` is at least `x + 2`, `func_1()` has been executed `numero_testes` times, `stdin` contains an unspecified number of lines of input that will be processed by `func_1()`.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed `numero_testes` times, and `func_1()` has been called `numero_testes` times. The value of `numero_testes` is at least `x + 2`, indicating that the loop has executed at least `x + 2` times. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing an unspecified number of lines of input that will be processed by `func_1()`.
