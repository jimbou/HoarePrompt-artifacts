Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, representing the values a_i and b_i respectively, but in reverse order, soma_b is 0, pref is 0, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - k):
    if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
        pref += soma_b
        pref += lista_A[i]
        soma_b = 0
    else:
        soma_b += lista_B[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input. If lista_A[i] is less than lista_B[i], then pref is equal to lista_A[0]. Otherwise, soma_b is equal to lista_B[0] and pref is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input. If lista_A[0] is less than lista_B[0] and lista_A[1] is less than lista_B[1], then pref is equal to lista_A[0] + lista_A[1] and soma_b is 0. If lista_A[0] is less than lista_B[0] but lista_A[1] is not less than lista_B[1], then pref is equal to lista_A[0] and soma_b is equal to lista_B[0] + lista_B[1]. If lista_A[0] is not less than lista_B[0], then pref is 0 and soma_b is equal to lista_B[0] + lista_B[1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than `k + 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input. If lista_A[0] is less than lista_B[0] and lista_A[1] is less than lista_B[1], then pref is equal to lista_A[0] + lista_A[1] + lista_A[2] and soma_b is 0. If lista_A[0] is less than lista_B[0] but lista_A[1] is not less than lista_B[1], then pref is equal to lista_A[0] + lista_B[0] + lista_B[1] and soma_b is 0. If lista_A[0] is not less than lista_B[0], then pref is equal to lista_B[0] + lista_B[1] and soma_b is equal to lista_B[0] + lista_B[1] + lista_B[2].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
