Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - k`, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input, pref is either the sum of all elements in lista_A, or 0, or the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A, soma_b is either 0, or the sum of all elements in lista_B, and resultado is positive infinity.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - k, n):
    resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
    soma_b += lista_B[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, i is n - k, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input, pref is either the sum of all elements in lista_A, or 0, or the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A, soma_b is either the sum of all elements in lista_B, or the sum of all elements in lista_B plus lista_B[i], and resultado is either positive infinity, or the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, i is n - k + 1, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input, pref is either the sum of all elements in lista_A, or 0, or the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B plus lista_B[i], and resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is greater than or equal to k + 1, k is a positive integer, i is n - k + 2, lista_A is a list of n positive integers, lista_B is a list of n positive integers, stdin contains no input, pref is either the sum of all elements in lista_A, or 0, or the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B plus 2 * lista_B[i], and resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
