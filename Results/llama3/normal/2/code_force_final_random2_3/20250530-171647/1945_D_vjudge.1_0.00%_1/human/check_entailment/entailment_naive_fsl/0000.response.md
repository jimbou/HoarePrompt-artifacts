Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The problem requires finding the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first m people in line.

Function 1 (`func_1`) correctly calculates the minimum number of coins by iterating through the reversed lists of `a` and `b` values. It maintains a running sum of `b` values (`soma_b`) and a prefix sum (`pref`) to efficiently calculate the minimum cost.

Function 2 (`func_2`) simply calls `func_1` for each test case, which is correct.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* It correctly handles the case where Kirill can reach the desired position without bribing anyone (i.e., when `a_i` is less than `b_i` for all `i`).
* It correctly handles the case where Kirill needs to bribe people to reach the desired position (i.e., when `a_i` is greater than or equal to `b_i` for some `i`).
* It correctly handles the case where the desired position is at the end of the queue (i.e., when `m` is equal to `n`).

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
