Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - k`, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input, pref is either the sum of all elements in lista_A, or 0, or the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A, soma_b is either 0, or the sum of all elements in lista_B, and resultado is positive infinity.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, lista_A, and lista_B remain the same as in the initial state. The values of pref and soma_b are still dependent on the comparison of elements in lista_A and lista_B, but their possible values are now more specific. Additionally, the variable resultado is now assigned the value of positive infinity.
