To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(numero_testes):`, which means the loop will execute as long as the current iteration is less than `numero_testes`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `numero_testes` is at least 1
* `stdin` contains an unspecified number of lines of input that will be processed by `func_1()`
* `func_1()` has been executed

Since the loop head only involves the variable `numero_testes`, we can only adjust its state.

For the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must be greater than the current iteration. Since the current iteration is not explicitly stated, we can assume it is the previous iteration's value plus one.

Let's denote the previous iteration's value as `x`. Then, the current iteration's value is `x + 1`.

For the loop to execute again, `numero_testes` must be greater than `x + 1`.

State: **`numero_testes` is at least `x + 2`, `stdin` contains an unspecified number of lines of input that will be processed by `func_1()`, `func_1()` has been executed**

Note that we cannot determine the exact value of `x`, so we use the notation `x + 2` to indicate that `numero_testes` must be at least one more than the current iteration's value.
