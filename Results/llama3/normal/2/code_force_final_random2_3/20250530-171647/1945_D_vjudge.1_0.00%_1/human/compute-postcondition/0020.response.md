Output State: **n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, i is n - k + 1, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input, pref is either the sum of all elements in lista_A, or 0, or the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B plus lista_B[i], and resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i].**

In this final state, the value of `resultado` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`. The value of `soma_b` has also been updated to include the value of `lista_B[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
