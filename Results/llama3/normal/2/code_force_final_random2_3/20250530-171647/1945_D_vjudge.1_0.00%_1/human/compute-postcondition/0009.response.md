Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input. If lista_A[0] is less than lista_B[0], then pref is equal to lista_A[0] and soma_b is equal to lista_B[0] + lista_B[1]. Otherwise, soma_b is equal to lista_B[0] + lista_B[1] and pref is 0.**

In this output state, the value of soma_b has been updated to include the second element of lista_B, which is lista_B[1]. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding pref and soma_b is still valid, but now soma_b has an additional value added to it.
