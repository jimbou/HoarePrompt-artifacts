The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - k + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `n - k + 2` and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - k + 2`, `lista_A` and `lista_B` are lists of `n` positive integers each, `stdin` contains no input, `pref` is either the sum of all elements in `lista_A`, or 0, or the sum of all elements in `lista_A` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B` plus the sum of all elements in `lista_B` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B` plus `lista_B[i]`, and `resultado` is the minimum of its original value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.**
