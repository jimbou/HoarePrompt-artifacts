You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, representing the values a_i and b_i respectively.
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: The final output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - k`, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input. If lista_A[i] is less than lista_B[i] for all i in the range [0, n - k), then pref is equal to the sum of all elements in lista_A and soma_b is 0. If lista_A[i] is not less than lista_B[i] for all i in the range [0, n - k), then pref is 0 and soma_b is equal to the sum of all elements in lista_B. If there exists at least one i in the range [0, n - k) such that lista_A[i] is less than lista_B[i] and at least one j in the range [0, n - k) such that lista_A[j] is not less than lista_B[j], then pref is equal to the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A, and soma_b is 0.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, i is n - 1, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input, pref is either the sum of all elements in lista_A, or 0, or the sum of all elements in lista_A that are less than the corresponding elements in lista_B plus the sum of all elements in lista_B that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in lista_A, soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B, and resultado is the minimum of its original value and pref + soma_b + lista_A[i].
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: The minimum value between the original value of resultado and the sum of pref, soma_b, and the last element of lista_A

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
