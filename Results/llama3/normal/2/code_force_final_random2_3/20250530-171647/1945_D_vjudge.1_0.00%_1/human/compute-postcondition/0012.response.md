Output State: **n is greater than k + 2, k is a positive integer, i is 2, lista_A and lista_B are lists of n positive integers each, stdin contains no input, pref is equal to the previous value of pref plus soma_b plus lista_A[2], soma_b is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `pref` is updated by adding the previous value of `soma_b` and `lista_A[2]` to it. The value of `soma_b` is reset to 0.
