Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square and checks if the given array elements can be used to construct such a square. The program first finds the smallest element in the array, which is the top-left element of the square. It then generates the elements of the square using the given rules and checks if the generated elements match the given array elements. If they match, the program returns 'yes', otherwise it returns 'no'. The program handles all possible cases and does not contain any syntax or logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
