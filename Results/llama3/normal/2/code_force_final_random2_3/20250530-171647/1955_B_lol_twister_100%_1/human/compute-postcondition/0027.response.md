Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing n^2 integers which are `a + k * c + d * h` for k in range(n) and h in range(n), `k` is n-1, `h` is n-1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the list `li` now contains `n^2` integers, each of which is the result of adding `a` (the smallest integer in `l`) to the product of `k` (which ranges from 0 to `n-1`) and `c`, and the product of `h` (which ranges from 0 to `n-1`) and `d`. The variables `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, and `a` remain unchanged.
