Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given list of integers can be rearranged into a progressive square according to the rules specified in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first finds the smallest integer `a` in the list `l`, which is the top-left element of the progressive square.
2. It then generates a new list `li` containing `n^2` integers of the form `a + k * c + d * h`, where `k` and `h` range from 0 to `n-1`. This correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square.
3. The program sorts both lists `l` and `li`. This is necessary because the problem statement does not guarantee that the input list `l` is sorted.
4. The program then checks if the sorted lists `l` and `li` are equal. If they are, it returns 'yes', indicating that the original list can be rearranged into the specified pattern. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
