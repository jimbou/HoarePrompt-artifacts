Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing 2n+2 integers which are `a + d * h` for h in range(n) and `a + k * c + d * h` for h in range(n+1) and k=2, `k` is 2, `h` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

In this output state, the list `li` has been updated by appending a new element `a + k * c + d * h`, where `k` is 2 and `h` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `li` now contains 2n+2 integers, including the newly added element.
