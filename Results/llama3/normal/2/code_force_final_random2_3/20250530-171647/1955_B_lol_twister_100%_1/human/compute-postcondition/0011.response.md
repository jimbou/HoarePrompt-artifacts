To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `h` and the range defined by `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is already defined as an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, we can conclude that `n` is indeed greater than 0.

The variable `h` is defined as `n-1`, but for the loop to execute, `h` should be within the range defined by `n`. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `h` to be within the range of `n`, specifically `h` is 0.

The state of other variables, such as `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `li`, and `k`, do not affect the execution of the loop, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing n integers which are `a + d * h` for h in range(n), `k` is 1, `h` is 0**
