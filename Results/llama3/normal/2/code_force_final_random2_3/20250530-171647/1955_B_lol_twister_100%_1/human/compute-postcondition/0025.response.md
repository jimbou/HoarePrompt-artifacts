Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing 3n integers which are `a + d * h` for h in range(n) and `a + k * c + d * h` for h in range(n) and k=2, `k` is 2, `h` is n.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `li` will contain `3n` integers, where `n` is the number of iterations. The first `n` integers in `li` will be of the form `a + d * h` for `h` in range `n`, and the next `n` integers will be of the form `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` in range `n` and `k=2`. The variable `h` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The other variables `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, and `a` will remain unchanged.
