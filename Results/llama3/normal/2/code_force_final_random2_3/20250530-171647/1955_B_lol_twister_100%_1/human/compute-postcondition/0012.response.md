Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing n+1 integers which are `a + d * h` for h in range(n+1), `k` is 1, `h` is 0**

In this output state, the list `li` has been updated to include an additional element `a + k * c + d * h`, where `k` is 1 and `h` is 0. This new element is equal to `a + c` since `k` is 1 and `h` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
