To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head. The loop head is `for k in range(0, n):`, so we can only adjust the variable `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `k` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.

For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k` is 2.

The other variables in the state, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `li`, and `h`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing 2n integers which are `a + d * h` for h in range(n) and `a + k * c + d * h` for h in range(n) and k=2, `k` is 2, `h` is n-1**
