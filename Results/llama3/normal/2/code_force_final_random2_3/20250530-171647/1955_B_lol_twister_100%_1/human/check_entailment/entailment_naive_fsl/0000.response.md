Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly constructs a progressive square based on the given values of n, c, and d, and checks if the elements of the array b can be used to construct this square.

The program first finds the minimum element in the array b, which is assumed to be the top-left element of the progressive square (a_{1,1}). It then constructs the progressive square by iterating over the rows and columns, adding the appropriate multiples of c and d to the current element.

The program then sorts both the constructed progressive square and the array b, and checks if they are equal. If they are, it returns 'yes', indicating that the elements of b can be used to construct the progressive square. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including cases where the array b contains duplicate elements or elements that are not part of the progressive square. It also correctly handles cases where the progressive square has a size of 2 or more.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
