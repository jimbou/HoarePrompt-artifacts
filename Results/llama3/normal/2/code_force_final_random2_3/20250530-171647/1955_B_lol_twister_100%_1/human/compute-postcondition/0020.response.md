Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing 2n+1 integers which are `a + d * h` for h in range(n) and `a + k * c + d * h` for h in range(n+1) and k=2, `k` is 2, `h` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, and `k` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `li` now contains an additional element which is `a + k * c + d * h` where `k` is 2 and `h` is 0. The value of `h` is still 0. The value of `n` is still greater than 0.
