Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing n+2 integers which are `a + d * h` for h in range(n+1) and `a + k * c + d * h` for h=1 and k=1, `k` is 1, `h` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `k`, and `h` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `li` now contains an additional element which is `a + k * c + d * h` for `h=1` and `k=1`.
