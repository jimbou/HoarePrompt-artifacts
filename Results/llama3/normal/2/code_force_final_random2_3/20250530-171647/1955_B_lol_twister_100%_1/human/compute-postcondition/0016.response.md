Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 < n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing n+3 integers which are `a + d * h` for h in range(n+1) and `a + k * c + d * h` for h=1 and k=1 and `a + c + 2d`, `k` is 1, `h` is 2**

In this output state, the list `li` has been updated to include the new element `a + c + 2d`, which is the result of the expression `a + k * c + d * h` with the current values of `k` and `h`. The other variables remain unchanged.
