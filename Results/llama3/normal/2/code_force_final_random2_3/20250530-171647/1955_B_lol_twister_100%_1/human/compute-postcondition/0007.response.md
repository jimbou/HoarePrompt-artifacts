Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing three integers which are `a + d`, `a + d`, and `a + d * 2`, `k` is 0, `h` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `li` has been updated by appending a new integer `a + k * c + d * h` to the list. Since `k` is 0, the new integer is `a + d * 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
