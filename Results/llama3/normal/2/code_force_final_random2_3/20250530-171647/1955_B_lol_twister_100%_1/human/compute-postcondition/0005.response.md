Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing two integers which are `a + d` and `a + d`, `k` is 0, `h` is 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `k`, and `h` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the list `li`, which now contains two integers: `a + d` (which was already present) and another `a + d` (which is the new element appended to the list).
