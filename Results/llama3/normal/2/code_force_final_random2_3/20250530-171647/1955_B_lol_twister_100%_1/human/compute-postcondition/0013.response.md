The only variable in the loop head is variable  h, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h` and `n`. If `h` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500. For the loop to execute again `h` must be increased by 1 so `h` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing n+1 integers which are `a + d * h` for h in range(n+1), `k` is 1, `h` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
