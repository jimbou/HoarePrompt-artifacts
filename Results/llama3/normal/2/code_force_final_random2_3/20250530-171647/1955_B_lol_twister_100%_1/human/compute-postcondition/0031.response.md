Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, c and d are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, a is the smallest integer in l, li is a sorted list containing n^2 integers which are a + k * c + d * h for k in range(n) and h in range(n), k is n-1, h is n-1. l and li are not equal***
