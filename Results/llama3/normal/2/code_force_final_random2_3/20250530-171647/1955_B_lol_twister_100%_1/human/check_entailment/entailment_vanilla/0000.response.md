Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine if a given array of integers can be rearranged into a progressive square of size n, based on the provided values of c and d.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the values of n, c, and d, which represent the size of the square and the values of c and d as described in the problem statement.

3. It then reads an array of n^2 integers, which are the elements found by Maxim.

4. The program defines a function func_1 that takes n, c, d, and the array l as input.

5. Inside the function, it finds the minimum value in the array l and assigns it to the variable a. This is because the problem statement specifies that the top-left element of the progressive square is the minimum value in the array.

6. It then constructs a new list li by iterating over each row and column of the progressive square, calculating the value at each position using the formula a + k * c + d * h, where k is the row index and h is the column index.

7. The program sorts both the original array l and the constructed list li in ascending order.

8. Finally, it checks if the sorted array l is equal to the sorted list li. If they are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that the array can be rearranged into a progressive square. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
