The only variable in the loop head is `h` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `h` is `n-1` which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `h` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing 2n integers which are `a + d * h` for h in range(n) and `a + k * c + d * h` for h in range(n) and k=2, `k` is 2, `h` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
