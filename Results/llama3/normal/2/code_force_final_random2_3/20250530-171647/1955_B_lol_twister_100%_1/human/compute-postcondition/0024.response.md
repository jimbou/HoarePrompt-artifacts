Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 < n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing 2n+3 integers which are `a + d * h` for h in range(n) and `a + k * c + d * h` for h in range(n+1) and k=2, `k` is 2, `h` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**

The code appends a new element to the list `li`, which is `a + k * c + d * h`. Since `k` is 2 and `h` is 2, the new element is `a + 2 * c + 2 * d`. The length of `li` is now 2n+3. The values of the other variables remain the same.
