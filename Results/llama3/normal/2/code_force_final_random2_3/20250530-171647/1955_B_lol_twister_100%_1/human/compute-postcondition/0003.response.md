Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `a` is the smallest integer in `l`, `li` is a list containing one integer which is `a + d`, `k` is 0, `h` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `li` has been updated to contain one integer which is `a + d`. This is because `k` is 0, so the term `k * c` is 0, and `h` is 0, so the term `d * h` is also 0. Therefore, the expression `a + k * c + d * h` simplifies to `a + d`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
