Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^3-1)**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin now contains multiple lines of input, with the first line containing a single integer t-1, which is one less than the original value of t due to the consumption of the first line of input.
