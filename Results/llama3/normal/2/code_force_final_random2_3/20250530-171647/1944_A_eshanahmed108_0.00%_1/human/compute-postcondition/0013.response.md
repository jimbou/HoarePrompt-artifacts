Functionality: **Reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases (t), and each subsequent line contains two integers (n and k). For each test case, it prints the value of n if n is less than or equal to k+1, otherwise it prints 1. After processing all test cases, stdin is empty.**
