Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

The print statement is a conditional expression that checks if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints the value of `n`. Otherwise, it prints 1.

Since `n` and `k` are integers, we can consider the following cases:

* If `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, it means that `n` is either equal to `k` or `k + 1`. In this case, the print statement will output the value of `n`.
* If `n - k` is greater than 1, it means that `n` is greater than `k + 1`. In this case, the print statement will output 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement depends on the values of `n` and `k`. If `n` is close to `k` (i.e., `n - k` is less than or equal to 1), the output will be the value of `n`. Otherwise, the output will be 1.

Output: **n if n is close to k (i.e., n - k <= 1), otherwise 1**
