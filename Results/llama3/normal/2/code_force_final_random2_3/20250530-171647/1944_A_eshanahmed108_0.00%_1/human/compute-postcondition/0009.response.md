Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^3-1), and this is printed: the value of `n` if `n` is less than or equal to `k+1`, otherwise 1**

In this output state, the values of `_`, `n`, and `k` are updated according to the input from stdin. The first line of stdin is consumed to assign values to `n` and `k`. The value of `n` is printed if it is less than or equal to `k+1`, otherwise, 1 is printed. The remaining lines of stdin are still available for further input.
