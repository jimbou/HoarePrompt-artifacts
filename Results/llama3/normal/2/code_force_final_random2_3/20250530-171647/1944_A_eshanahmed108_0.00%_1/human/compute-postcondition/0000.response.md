The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `input()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3). So for the loop to be executed, the `input()` must be at least 1 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3), `_` is 0, `input()` must be at least 1**
