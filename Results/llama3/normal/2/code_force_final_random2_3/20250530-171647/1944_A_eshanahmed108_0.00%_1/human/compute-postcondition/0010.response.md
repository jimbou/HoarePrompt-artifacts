The code prints the value of `n` if `n` is less than or equal to `k+1`, otherwise it prints 1.
Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of the output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either the value of `n` or 1, depending on the condition `n - k <= 1`.
Output: **n if n is less than or equal to k+1, otherwise 1**
