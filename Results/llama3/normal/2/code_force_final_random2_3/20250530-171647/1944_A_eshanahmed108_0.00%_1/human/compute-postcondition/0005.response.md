Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^3-1), and this is printed: the value of `n` if `n` is less than or equal to `k+1`, otherwise 1**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged as 1. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers read from the input, which are split by the `map` function and assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, with the first line being a single integer t-1, and the rest of the lines remaining unchanged. The condition for printing the value of `n` or 1 is also updated based on the new values of `n` and `k`.
