Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the median of the array and then counts the number of occurrences of the median. The number of operations required to increase the median is equal to the count of the median, because each operation increases the median by 1.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself. It then sorts the array in ascending order.

The program calculates the index `p` of the middle element in the sorted array using the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This formula works because the index of the middle element is the ceiling of `n/2`, and in Python, the `//` operator performs integer division, which rounds down to the nearest whole number.

The program then counts the number of occurrences of the middle element using the `count` method of the list. This gives the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Finally, the program prints the count of the middle element, which is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Correctness: **True**
