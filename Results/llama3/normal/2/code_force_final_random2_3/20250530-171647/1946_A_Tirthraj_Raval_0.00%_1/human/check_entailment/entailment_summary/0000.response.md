Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. The program reads multiple test cases, sorts the array, finds the middle element (median), counts its occurrences, and prints the count.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the problem's requirements. The median of an array is the middle element when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. By counting the occurrences of the median, the program effectively determines the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

The program's use of the `sort()` method to sort the array is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n log n). The `count()` method is also used to count the occurrences of the median, which has a time complexity of O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity of the program is O(n log n) + O(n) = O(n log n), which is acceptable for the given constraints.

The program's output matches the expected output for the provided example test cases, which further confirms its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
