The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, t must be decreased by 1.
State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, p is an integer, res is the count of the middle element in the sorted list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the count of the middle element in the sorted list a which is res is being printed**
