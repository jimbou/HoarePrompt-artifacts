Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in cases where the median is not unique. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3], the median is 2, but the program will count the number of occurrences of 2 and print 2, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1, because we only need to increase one of the 2's to increase the median.

In the given program, the line `res = a.count(a[p])` is the culprit. This line counts the number of occurrences of the median, but it does not take into account the fact that we only need to increase one of the median values to increase the median. 

To fix this, we need to modify the program to only count the number of occurrences of the median that are less than or equal to the median. This can be done by changing the line `res = a.count(a[p])` to `res = a[p:].count(a[p])`. This will correctly count the number of occurrences of the median that need to be increased to increase the median.
