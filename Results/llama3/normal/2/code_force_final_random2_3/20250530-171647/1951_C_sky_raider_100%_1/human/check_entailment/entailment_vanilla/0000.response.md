Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by sorting the list of ticket prices and then iterating through the sorted list. In each iteration, it calculates the cost of buying the minimum of `m` (the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day) and `k` (the remaining number of tickets to be purchased) tickets at the current price, adds this cost to the total cost `c`, and updates the remaining number of tickets to be purchased `k`.

However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. The program is not correctly implementing the dynamic programming approach. It is not considering the fact that the price of the tickets increases by the number of tickets purchased on each day.
2. The program is not correctly calculating the cost of buying the tickets. It is simply multiplying the number of tickets purchased by the current price, without considering the fact that the price increases by the number of tickets purchased.
3. The program is not correctly updating the remaining number of tickets to be purchased `k`. It is simply subtracting the number of tickets purchased from `k`, without considering the fact that the number of tickets that can be purchased on each day is limited by `m`.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a dynamic programming approach that takes into account the fact that the price of the tickets increases by the number of tickets purchased on each day, and that the number of tickets that can be purchased on each day is limited by `m`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        dp = [[float('inf')] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(k + 1):
                for x in range(min(m, j) + 1):
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - x] + x * (l[i - 1] + x))
        print(dp[n][k])
```
This program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum cost of purchasing `k` tickets. It iterates through the list of ticket prices, and for each price, it calculates the minimum cost of purchasing `j` tickets, considering all possible numbers of tickets that can be purchased on the current day.

Correctness: **False**
