To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is initially 0, we can keep it as is, but we need to ensure `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `t` is 0, `s` is 0, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
