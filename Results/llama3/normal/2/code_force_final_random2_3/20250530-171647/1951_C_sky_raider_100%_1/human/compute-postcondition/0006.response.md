The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer minus 2s, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `t` is 2s, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` is 2s * (l[i] + 2s), stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
