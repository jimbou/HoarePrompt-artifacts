Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^9)). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    t = 0
    s = 0
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        c += s * (l[i] + t)
        t += s
        k -= s
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is n-1, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer minus the sum of the minimum of m and k for n times, l is a sorted list of integers, t is the sum of the minimum of m and k for n times, s is the minimum of m and k, c is the sum of the minimum of m and k times (l[i] + the sum of the minimum of m and k for i times) for n times, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the integer value of c is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, k is an integer minus the sum of s for all iterations, l is a sorted list of integers, t is the sum of s for all iterations, s is the minimum of m and k, c is the sum of s times the sum of the i-th element of l and the original value of t for all iterations, i is n-1, and the integer value of c is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer minus n * min(m, k), l is a sorted list of integers, t is n * min(m, k), s is min(m, k), c is the sum of s * (l[i] + (i-1) * s) for i in range(n), i is n-1, and the integer value of c is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
