Output State: **i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers, t is 0, s is 0, c is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**.

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged as 0. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values from the first line of input. The list `l` is assigned a sorted list of integers from the second line of input. The variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are initialized to 0. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, as two lines of input have been consumed by the code.
