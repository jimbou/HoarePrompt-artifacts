Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer minus n * min(m, k), l is a sorted list of integers, t is n * min(m, k), s is min(m, k), c is the sum of s * (l[i] + (i-1) * s) for i in range(n), i is n-1**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `k` has been reduced by `n` times the minimum of `m` and `k`, the list `l` remains unchanged, `t` has been incremented by `n` times the minimum of `m` and `k`, `s` remains the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` has been incremented by the sum of `s` times the sum of `l[i]` and `(i-1)` times `s` for all `i` in the range of `n`, and `i` has been incremented to `n-1`.
