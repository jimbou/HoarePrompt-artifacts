This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers. It sorts the integers, then iterates through them, calculating a sum c by multiplying the minimum of m and k by the sum of the current integer and a running total t, and adding this product to c. The function prints the integer value of c for each test case.
