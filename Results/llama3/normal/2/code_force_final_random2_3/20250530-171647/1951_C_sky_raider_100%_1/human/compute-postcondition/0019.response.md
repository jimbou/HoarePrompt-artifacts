Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, k is an integer minus the sum of s for all iterations, l is a sorted list of integers, t is the sum of s for all iterations, s is the minimum of m and k, c is the sum of s times the sum of the i-th element of l and the original value of t for all iterations, i is n-1**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, `m` and `l` also remain unchanged, `k` has been reduced by the sum of `s` for all iterations, `t` has accumulated the sum of `s` for all iterations, `s` remains the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` has accumulated the sum of `s` times the sum of the `i-th` element of `l` and the original value of `t` for all iterations, and `i` has reached `n-1`.
