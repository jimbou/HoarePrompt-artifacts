Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers, t is 0, s is 0, c is 0, i is not defined**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `t`, `s`, or `c`. The first line assigns the values of the input to `n`, `m`, and `k`, but since the initial state already specifies that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, this line does not change their types. The second line assigns a sorted list of integers to `l`, but since the initial state already specifies that `l` is a sorted list of integers, this line does not change its type or values. The third, fourth, and fifth lines initialize `t`, `s`, and `c` to 0, but since the initial state does not specify their values, these lines do not change their values. The sixth line does not assign a value to `i`, so it remains undefined.
