Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to purchase tickets. The problem statement requires that the price per ticket increases by x after purchasing x tickets on a day. However, the program does not take this into account. It simply sorts the prices and then purchases the minimum number of tickets on each day, without considering the increase in price.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will sort the prices and purchase 2 tickets on the first day (price 8), 1 ticket on the second day (price 6), and 0 tickets on the third and fourth days. However, this is not the optimal solution. A better solution would be to purchase 1 ticket on the third day (price 4) and 2 tickets on the fourth day (price 2 + 2 = 4), resulting in a total cost of 10.

The program does not consider this scenario and therefore does not produce the correct output.
