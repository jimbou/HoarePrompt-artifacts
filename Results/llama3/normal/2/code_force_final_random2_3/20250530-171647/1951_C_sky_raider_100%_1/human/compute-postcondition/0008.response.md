Output State: **i is n-1, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer minus the sum of the minimum of m and k for n times, l is a sorted list of integers, t is the sum of the minimum of m and k for n times, s is the minimum of m and k, c is the sum of the minimum of m and k times (l[i] + the sum of the minimum of m and k for i times) for n times, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

The loop has finished executing, and the variable `i` has reached the value of `n-1`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged. The variable `k` has been reduced by the sum of the minimum of `m` and `k` for `n` times. The variable `t` has accumulated the sum of the minimum of `m` and `k` for `n` times. The variable `s` still holds the minimum of `m` and `k`. The variable `c` has accumulated the sum of the minimum of `m` and `k` times the sum of `l[i]` and the sum of the minimum of `m` and `k` for `i` times, for `n` times. The input from `stdin` remains unchanged, with multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
