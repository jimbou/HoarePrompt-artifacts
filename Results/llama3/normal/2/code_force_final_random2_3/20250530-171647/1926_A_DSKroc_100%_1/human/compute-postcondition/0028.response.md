Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 32, `q` is 1, `ac` is the number of 'A's in the string `s`, `bc` is the number of 'B's in the string `s`, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `i` is 'A', stdin contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. The current value of `i` is 'A'. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, 'A' is printed. Otherwise, 'B' is printed.**
