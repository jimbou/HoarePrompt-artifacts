Output State: **`t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 32, `q` is 1, `ac` is the number of 'A's in the string `s` plus 1, `bc` is the number of 'B's in the string `s`, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `i` is 'A', stdin contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, 'A' is printed. Otherwise, 'B' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ac` has been incremented by 1, indicating that there is one more 'A' in the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged. The program still has `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B in the standard input. The current value of `i` is still 'A'. The program will print 'A' if `ac` is greater than `bc`, and 'B' otherwise.
