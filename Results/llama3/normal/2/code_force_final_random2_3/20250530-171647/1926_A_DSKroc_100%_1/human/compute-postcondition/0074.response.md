Functionality: **This function reads a series of input strings from standard input, each consisting of 5 letters 'A' and 'B', and prints the dominant letter ('A' if 'A's are more than 'B's, 'B' otherwise) for each string. The function processes a specified number of strings (between 1 and 32), as indicated by the first input integer. After processing all strings, the function leaves the standard input empty.**
