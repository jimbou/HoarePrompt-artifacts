Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `q` is 0, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the string, stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 4 and `bc` is 0. If `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 3 if `i` is 'A' in the else part, otherwise `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 4.***
