Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 32, `q` is 2, `s` is a string of length 6 consisting of letters A and B, `stdin` contains `t-6` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If the second character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is increased by 1 from its previous value and `bc` has a specific value based on the first character of `s`. If the second character of `s` is not 'A', then `ac` has a specific value based on the first character of `s` and `bc` is 1 more than its previous value based on the first character of `s`.***
