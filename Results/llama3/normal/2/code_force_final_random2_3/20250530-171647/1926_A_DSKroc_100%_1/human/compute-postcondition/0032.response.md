Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 32, `q` is 1, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `i` is either 'A' or 'B', stdin contains `t-3` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in the string `s` plus 1 and `bc` is the number of 'B's in the string `s`. If `i` is 'B', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in the string `s` and `bc` is the number of 'B's in the string `s` plus 1. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, 'A' is printed. Otherwise, 'B' is printed.**
