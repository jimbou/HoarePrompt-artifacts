Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `q` is 0, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the string, stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 1. If `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is 0 and `bc` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1. If `i` is 'A', then `bc` is now 1. If `i` is not 'A', then `bc` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
