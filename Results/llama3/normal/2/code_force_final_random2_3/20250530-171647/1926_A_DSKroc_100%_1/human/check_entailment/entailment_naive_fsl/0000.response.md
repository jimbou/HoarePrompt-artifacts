Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines the most frequent letter in a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. It initializes counters for 'A' and 'B', then iterates over the string, incrementing the appropriate counter for each letter. Finally, it prints the letter with the higher count.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If 'A' appears more frequently than 'B', it prints 'A'.
* If 'B' appears more frequently than 'A', it prints 'B'.
* If 'A' and 'B' appear with the same frequency, it prints 'B' (since the problem statement does not specify what to do in this case, but the program's behavior is consistent).

The program also handles the edge cases correctly:

* If the input string is not of length 5, the program will still work correctly, although this is not explicitly stated in the problem description.
* If the input string contains characters other than 'A' and 'B', the program will ignore them and still produce the correct output.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
