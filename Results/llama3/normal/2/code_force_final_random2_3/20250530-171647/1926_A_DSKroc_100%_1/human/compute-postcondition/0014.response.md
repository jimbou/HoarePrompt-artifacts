Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 32, `q` is 0, `s` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the string, stdin contains t-1 strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 4 and `bc` is 0. If `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `q` is still 0, and the string `s` and its third character `i` also remain unchanged. The number of strings in stdin is still `t-1`. The value of `ac` has been incremented by 1. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is now 4 and `bc` is still 0. If `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is now 1 and `bc` is still 3.
