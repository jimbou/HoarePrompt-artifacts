Output State: **`t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 32, `q` is 2, `s` is a string of length 6 consisting of letters A and B, `ac` is either the number of 'A's in the string `s` plus 1 or the number of 'A's in the string `s`, `bc` is either the number of 'B's in the string `s` plus 2 or the number of 'B's in the string `s` plus 1, `stdin` contains `t-6` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `bc` has been incremented by 1. The initial value of `bc` was either the number of 'B's in the string `s` plus 1 or the number of 'B's in the string `s`, depending on the first character of the string `s`. Now, `bc` is either the number of 'B's in the string `s` plus 2 or the number of 'B's in the string `s` plus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
