Output State: **`t` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 32, `q` is 2, `s` is a string of length 6 consisting of letters A and B, `ac` is either the number of 'A's in the string `s` plus 2 or the number of 'A's in the string `s` plus 1, `bc` is either the number of 'B's in the string `s` plus one or the number of 'B's in the string `s`, `stdin` contains `t-6` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `ac` has been incremented by 1. If the first character in the string `s` is 'A', then `ac` is the number of 'A's in the string `s` plus 2, otherwise, `ac` is the number of 'A's in the string `s` plus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
