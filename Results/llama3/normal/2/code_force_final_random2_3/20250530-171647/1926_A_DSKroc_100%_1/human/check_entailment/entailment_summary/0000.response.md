Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the most frequent letter in a string of length 5, consisting of only 'A's and 'B's. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a string and counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. It then prints the letter that appears most frequently.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a string and prints the dominant letter. The program also correctly handles the case where the number of 'A's and 'B's is equal, in which case it prints 'B'.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected. It reads the input strings, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', and prints the dominant letter for each string.

Correctness: **True**
