Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to 2 times its original value, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`. If the second last element of `b` is not equal to the last element of `b`, then `l` is a list containing the first and last elements of `b`. Otherwise, `ans1` is a list containing two times the last element of `b`, `l` is not defined, and the second last element of `b` is equal to the last element of `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`. If `k` is 0, then `k` is 0, `req` is 0, the second last element of `b` is equal to the last element of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, and `ans2` is an empty list. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, and `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, ans1 is a list, ans2 is a list, req is equal to 2 times the original value of k, i is 2. If k is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. If b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], then k is equal to its original value minus 2 and ans1 is a list containing two copies of the (i+1)th smallest integer from a. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1], then l is a list containing the third smallest integer from a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`, `i` is 3. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the 4th smallest integer from `a`, and `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k` minus 4. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` is a list that contains the 4th element of `b`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
