Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is -2n, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `ans1` is a list containing 2n copies of the current value of `b[i]` or 2n - 2 copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and we are now outside the loop or if statement that contained the break statement.
