Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is -2n, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `req` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is still 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
