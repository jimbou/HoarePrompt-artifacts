Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is -2n, i is n - 1, ans1 is a list containing 2n copies of the current value of b[n - 1] or 2n - 2 copies of the current value of b[n - 1] plus n additional elements which are the values of l[i], ans2 is a list containing n additional elements which are the values of l[i], l is a list containing n elements which are the values of b[n - 1], k is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` is now `n - 1`, the list `ans1` contains `2n` copies of the current value of `b[n - 1]` or `2n - 2` copies of the current value of `b[n - 1]` plus `n` additional elements which are the values of `l[i]`, the list `ans2` contains `n` additional elements which are the values of `l[i]`, the list `l` contains `n` elements which are the values of `b[n - 1]`, and the value of `k` is now `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.
