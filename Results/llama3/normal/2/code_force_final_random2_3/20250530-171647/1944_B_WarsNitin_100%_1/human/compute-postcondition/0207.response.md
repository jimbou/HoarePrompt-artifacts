Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, `req` is 2k, `k` is either -2 or non-zero minus one, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from b, the ith element of l, and the ith element of l, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of each pair of equal consecutive elements from c, the ith element of l, and the ith element of l, `i` is 2, and `l` is either a list containing the smallest integer from b and the largest integer from b, a list containing the largest integer from b, a list containing the smallest integer from b and the ith element of b, and must have at least 3 elements. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
