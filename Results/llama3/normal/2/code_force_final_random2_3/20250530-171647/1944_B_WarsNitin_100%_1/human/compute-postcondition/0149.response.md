Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is n - 1, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from b, ans2 is an empty list, k is req - 4, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b or an empty list depending on whether the first two elements of b are different.**

In this output state, the value of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `req` remains unchanged. The value of `i` also remains the same. The value of `ans1` is updated to contain two copies of the largest integer from `b`, which is `b[n - 1]`. The value of `ans2` remains an empty list. The value of `k` is decremented by 2, making it `req - 4`. The value of `l` depends on whether the first two elements of `b` are different. If they are different, `l` contains the smallest integer from `b`. Otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.
