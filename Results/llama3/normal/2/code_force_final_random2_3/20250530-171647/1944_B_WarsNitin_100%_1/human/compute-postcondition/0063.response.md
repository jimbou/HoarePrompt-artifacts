Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is -1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, `ans1` is a list containing l[i], `ans2` is a list containing l[i], `req` is 0, `i` is 1, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
