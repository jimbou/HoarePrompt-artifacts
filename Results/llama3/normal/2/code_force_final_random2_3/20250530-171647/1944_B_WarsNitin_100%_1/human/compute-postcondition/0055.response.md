Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `req` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1`. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the `n`th smallest integer from `a`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the `n`th smallest integer from `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows: The loop will continue to execute until `k` becomes 0 or `i` reaches `n-1`. In each iteration, if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i-1]`, then `ans2` will have two additional elements equal to the element at index `i` in list `c`, and `k` will be decremented by 2. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i-1]`, then no changes will be made to `ans2` or `k`. Once the loop finishes executing, `k` will be 0, and `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, and `req` will remain unchanged.
