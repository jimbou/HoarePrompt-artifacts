Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, ans1 is a list, ans2 is a list with two additional elements equal to the element at index i in list c, i is 1, k is either -2 or 2 times its original value minus 2, and req is either 0 or 2 times the original value of k.**

In this output state, the value of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans1`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `ans2` has been modified by appending two elements equal to the element at index `i` in list `c`. The value of `k` has been decremented by 2, and its new value depends on its original value. The value of `req` remains either 0 or 2 times the original value of `k`.
