Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`, `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The break statement does not change the values of any variables, but it affects the control flow of the program.
