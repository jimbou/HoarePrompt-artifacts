Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`. If `k` is 0, then `k` is 0, `req` is 0, the second last element of `b` is equal to the last element of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, and `ans2` is an empty list. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, and `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`.**
