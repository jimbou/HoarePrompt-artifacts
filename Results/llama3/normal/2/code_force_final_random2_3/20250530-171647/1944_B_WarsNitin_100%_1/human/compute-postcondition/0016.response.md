Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, k is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, req is equal to 2 times the original value of k minus 2.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been decremented by 2, and two copies of the current value of `b[i]` have been appended to `ans1`. The value of `req` has also been updated to reflect the new value of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
