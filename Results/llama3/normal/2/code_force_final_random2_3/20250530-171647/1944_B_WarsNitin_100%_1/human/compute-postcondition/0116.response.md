Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is -2n, `i` is 2, `ans1` is a list containing 2n copies of the current value of `b[i]` or 2n - 2 copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `c[i]` and `k` is -2. Otherwise, no change occurs and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
