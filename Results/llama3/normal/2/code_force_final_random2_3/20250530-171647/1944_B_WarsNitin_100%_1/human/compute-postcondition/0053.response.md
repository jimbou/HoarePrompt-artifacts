Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, ans1 is a list, ans2 has two additional elements equal to the element at index i in list c, k is either -4 or 0, and req is either 0 or 2 times the original value of k, i is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `q` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each test case containing one line, as the code does not modify the input. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The lists `a`, `b`, and `c` also remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `ans1` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list `ans2` has two additional elements equal to the element at index `i` in list `c`, as the code appends two elements to `ans2`. The value of `k` is either -4 or 0, as the code subtracts 2 from `k`. The value of `req` is either 0 or 2 times the original value of `k`, as the code does not modify `req`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
