Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `i` is 1. If `k` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and `req` is equal to 0. Otherwise, `k` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k` and `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`.***
