Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is 2. If c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], then ans2 contains two additional elements equal to c[2] and k is 2 less than its original value. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
