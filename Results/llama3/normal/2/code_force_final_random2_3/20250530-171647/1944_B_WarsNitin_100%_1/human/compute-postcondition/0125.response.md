Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is -2n, `i` is n - 1, `ans1` is a list containing 2n copies of the current value of `b[i]` or 2n - 2 copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` is a list containing two more copies of the current value of `c[i]` and `k` is -2n. Otherwise, no change occurs and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is not equal to 0. If `k` is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n - 1` or `k` becomes 0. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` will contain two more copies of the current value of `c[i]` and `k` will be decremented by 2. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, then no change will occur and the loop will break if `k` is not equal to 0. If `k` is 0, then the loop will also break. The values of `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `ans1`, and `l` will remain unchanged.
