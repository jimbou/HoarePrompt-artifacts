Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is 2k, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
