Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is an integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, k is -2n, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is -2n, i is n - 1. If the first two elements of b are different, then l is a list containing the smallest integer from the first n integers of list a and the largest integer from the first n integers of list a. If the first two elements of b are the same, then l is a list containing the largest integer from the first n integers of list a. If the first two elements of b are the same, then k is -2n - 2, ans1 is a list containing two instances of the largest integer from the first n integers of list a.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is -2n, `i` is 1. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]` and `ans2` is an empty list, and `k` is -2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is -2n, `i` is 2. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing four copies of the current value of `b[i]` and `k` is -4. Otherwise, `ans1` is either a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]` or an empty list, and `k` is -2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is -2n, `i` is 3. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing either six copies of the current value of `b[i]`, four copies of the current value of `b[i]`, or two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, and `k` is either -6, -4, or -2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is either a list containing four copies of the current value of `b[i]`, a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, or an empty list, and `k` is either -4 or -2. Additionally, if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
