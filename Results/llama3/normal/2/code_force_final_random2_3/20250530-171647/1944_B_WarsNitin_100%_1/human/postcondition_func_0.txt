This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers, sorting them and selecting specific elements based on certain conditions. It prints two lists of integers, ans1 and ans2, which contain specific elements from the input, including pairs of equal consecutive elements and single elements that meet certain criteria. The function repeats this process for each test case, ultimately printing the processed lists for each case.
