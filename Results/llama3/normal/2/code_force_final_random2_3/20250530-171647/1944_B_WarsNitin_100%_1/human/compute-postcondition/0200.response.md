Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is 0, k is either -1 or non-zero, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from b and the ith element of l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each pair of equal consecutive elements from c and the ith element of l, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b and the largest integer from b, a list containing the largest integer from b, a list containing the smallest integer from b and the ith element of b, and must have at least 1 element.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `req` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` is still 0, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `k` is either -1 or non-zero, depending on its initial value. The lists `ans1` and `ans2` have been appended with the `i`-th element of `l`, which is either the smallest integer from `b`, the largest integer from `b`, or the `i`-th element of `b`. The list `l` remains unchanged, but its `i`-th element has been appended to `ans1` and `ans2`.
