The code prints the elements of the list `ans1`. The list `ans1` contains either 2n copies of the current value of `b[n - 1]` or 2n - 2 copies of the current value of `b[n - 1]` plus n additional elements which are the values of `l[i]`. Since `l` is a list containing n elements which are the values of `b[n - 1]`, the additional elements in `ans1` are also the value of `b[n - 1]`. Therefore, `ans1` contains either 2n copies of the current value of `b[n - 1]` or 2n - 2 copies of the current value of `b[n - 1]` plus n additional copies of the current value of `b[n - 1]`, which is equivalent to 2n copies of the current value of `b[n - 1]`. The value of `b[n - 1]` is the (n - 1)th element of the sorted list `b`, which is the sorted list of the first n integers from `a`. Therefore, the value of `b[n - 1]` is the (n - 1)th smallest integer in the first n integers from `a`.

Output: **2n copies of the (n - 1)th smallest integer in the first n integers from a**
