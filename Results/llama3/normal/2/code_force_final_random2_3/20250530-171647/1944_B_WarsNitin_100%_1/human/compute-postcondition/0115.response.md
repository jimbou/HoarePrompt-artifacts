To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is -2n, `i` is 2, `ans1` is a list containing 2n copies of the current value of `b[i]` or 2n - 2 copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `c[i]` and `k` is -2. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
