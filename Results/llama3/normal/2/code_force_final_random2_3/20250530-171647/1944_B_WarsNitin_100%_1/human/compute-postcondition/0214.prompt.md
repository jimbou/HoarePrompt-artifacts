Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, the first line of the first test case has been read.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    if b[0] != b[1]:
        l.append(b[0])
    if b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    else:
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        k -= 2
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
            l.append(b[i])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
        k -= 1
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, k is -n, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, ans1 is a list containing n copies of l[i], ans2 is a list containing n copies of l[i], req is 0, i is n - 1, l is a list that must have at least n elements, and a list of n copies of the nth element of list l is being printed, and this is printed: a list of n copies of the nth element of list l

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is -2n, i is n - 1, ans1 is a list containing 2n copies of the current value of b[n - 1] or 2n - 2 copies of the current value of b[n - 1] plus n additional elements which are the values of l[i], ans2 is a list containing n additional elements which are the values of l[i], l is a list containing n elements which are the values of b[n - 1], k is 0, and the list ans2 is printed which contains n additional elements which are the values of l[i]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is len(l) - 1, k is either -len(l) or non-zero minus len(l) + 1, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from b and all elements of l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each pair of equal consecutive elements from c and all elements of l, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b and the largest integer from b, a list containing the largest integer from b, a list containing the smallest integer from b and the ith element of b, and two copies of the nth integer from a and either two copies of the smallest integer from a and the nth integer from a, two copies of the nth integer from a, or two copies of the smallest integer from a and the ith element of b are printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
