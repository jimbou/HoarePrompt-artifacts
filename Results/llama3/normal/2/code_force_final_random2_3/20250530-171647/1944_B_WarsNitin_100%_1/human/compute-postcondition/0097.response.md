Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is -2n, `i` is 2, `ans1` is either a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]` or an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is -2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
