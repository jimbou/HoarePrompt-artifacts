Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is -2n, i is 2, ans1 is a list containing four copies of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, k is -4, and if b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1] and b[i] is not equal to b[i + 1], then l is a list containing the value of b[i].**

The code appends the current value of `b[i]` to `ans1` twice, effectively adding two copies of `b[i]` to `ans1`. This makes `ans1` a list containing four copies of the current value of `b[i]`. The value of `k` is decremented by 2, making it -4. No other variables are affected by the code.
