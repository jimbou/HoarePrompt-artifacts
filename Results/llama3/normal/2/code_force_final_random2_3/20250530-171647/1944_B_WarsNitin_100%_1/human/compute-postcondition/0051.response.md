Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` has two additional elements equal to the element at index `i` in list `c`, `k` is either -2 or 2 times its original value minus 2, and `req` is either 0 or 2 times the original value of `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans2`, `k`, or `req`, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted by the break statement.
