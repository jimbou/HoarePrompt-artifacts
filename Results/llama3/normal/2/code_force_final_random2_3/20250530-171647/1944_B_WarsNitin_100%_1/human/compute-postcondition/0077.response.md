Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, k is -2n, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is -2n, i is n - 1. If the first two elements of b are different, then l is a list containing the smallest integer from the first n integers of list a, otherwise l is an empty list.***
