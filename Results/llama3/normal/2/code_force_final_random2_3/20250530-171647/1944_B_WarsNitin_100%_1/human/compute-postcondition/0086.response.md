Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, req is -2n, i is 1, k is -2.**

The code appends the current value of `b[i]` to `ans1` twice, effectively adding two copies of the same value. Since `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, both appended values are the same. The value of `k` is decremented by 2. No other variables are affected.
