Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is -2n, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is -2n, `i` is n - 1, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer from the first n integers of list a and the largest integer from the first n integers of list a. If the first two elements of b are the same, then l is a list containing the largest integer from the first n integers of list a.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the largest integer from the first n integers of list a, in addition to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
