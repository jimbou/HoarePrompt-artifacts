Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is 1, k is either -2 or non-zero minus one, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from b, the ith element of l, and the ith element of l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each pair of equal consecutive elements from c, the ith element of l, and the ith element of l, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b and the largest integer from b, a list containing the largest integer from b, a list containing the smallest integer from b and the ith element of b, and must have at least 2 elements.**

The code appends the ith element of l to ans1 and ans2, and decrements k by 1. Since i is 1, the ith element of l is appended to both ans1 and ans2. The value of k is either -2 or non-zero minus one, depending on its initial value. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
