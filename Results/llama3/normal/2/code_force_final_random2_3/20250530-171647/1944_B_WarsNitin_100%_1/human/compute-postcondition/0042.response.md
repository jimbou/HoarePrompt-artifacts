Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `i` is 1. The current value of `k` is either 0 or 2 times its original value, and the current value of `req` is either 0 or 2 times the original value of `k`. Additionally, the element at index `i` in list `c` is equal to the element at index `i-1` in list `c`.***
