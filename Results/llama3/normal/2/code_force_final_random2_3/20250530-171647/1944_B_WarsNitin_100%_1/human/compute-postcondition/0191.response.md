Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is 2k, `i` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
