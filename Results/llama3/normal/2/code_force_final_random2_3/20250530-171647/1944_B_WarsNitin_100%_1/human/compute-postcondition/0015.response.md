Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer equal to 2 times its original value, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`. If `k` is 0, then `k` is 0, `req` is 0, the second last element of `b` is equal to the last element of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute. The current value of `b[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i - 1]`.***
