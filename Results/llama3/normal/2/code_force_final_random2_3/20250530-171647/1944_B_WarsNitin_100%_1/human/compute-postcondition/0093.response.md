Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is -2n, `i` is 2, `ans1` is either a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]` or an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is -2, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans1` depends on whether `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`. If they are equal, `ans1` contains two copies of `b[i]`; otherwise, it is an empty list. The value of `l` is only defined if `b[i]` is not equal to both `b[i - 1]` and `b[i + 1]`, in which case it contains the value of `b[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
