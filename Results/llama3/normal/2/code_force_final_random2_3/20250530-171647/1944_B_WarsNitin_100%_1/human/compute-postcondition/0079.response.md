Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, k is -2n - 2, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, ans1 is a list containing two instances of the largest integer from the first n integers of list a, ans2 is an empty list, req is -2n, i is n - 1. If the first two elements of b are different, then l is a list containing the smallest integer from the first n integers of list a, otherwise l is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans2`, `req`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `k` is decremented by 2, resulting in `-2n - 2`. The value of `ans1` is updated to contain two instances of the largest integer from the first `n` integers of list `a`, which is `b[n - 1]`. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing multiple test cases minus one.
