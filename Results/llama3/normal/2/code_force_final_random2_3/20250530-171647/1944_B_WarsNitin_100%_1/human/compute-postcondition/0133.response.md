Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is -2n, i is 1, ans1 is a list containing 2n copies of the current value of b[n - 1] or 2n - 2 copies of the current value of b[n - 1] plus one additional element which is the value of b[n - 1], ans2 is a list containing one additional element which is the value of b[n - 1], l is a list containing at least 2 elements which is the value of b[n - 1], and if k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, k is k - 1.**
