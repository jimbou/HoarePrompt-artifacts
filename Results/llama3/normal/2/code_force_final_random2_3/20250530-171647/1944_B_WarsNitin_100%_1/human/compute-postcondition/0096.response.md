Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is -2n, `i` is 2, `ans1` is either a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]` or an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is -2, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]` and the current value of `b[i]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 1, `q` is still 1, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one. The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to 3, and `a` is still a list of integers. The list `b` is still a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, and `c` is still a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`. The value of `req` is still -2n, and `i` is still 2. The list `ans1` is still either a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]` or an empty list, and `ans2` is still an empty list. The value of `k` is still -2. The list `l` now contains the value of `b[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
