Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, `req` is -2n, `i` is 3, `ans1` is a list containing 2n copies of the current value of b[i] or 2n - 2 copies of the current value of b[i], `l` is a list containing the value of b[i]. If c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], then ans2 is a list containing two more copies of the current value of c[i] and k is -4. Otherwise, no change occurs and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if k is not equal to 0. If k is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
