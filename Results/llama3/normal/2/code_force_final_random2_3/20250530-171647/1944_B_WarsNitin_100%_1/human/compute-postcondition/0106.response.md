Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is -2n, `i` is n - 1. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing 2n copies of the current value of `b[i]` and `k` is 0. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing 2n - 2 copies of the current value of `b[i]` and `k` is -2. Additionally, if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n - 1`. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` will contain 2n copies of the current value of `b[i]` and `k` will be 0. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` will contain 2n - 2 copies of the current value of `b[i]` and `k` will be -2. Additionally, if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` will contain the value of `b[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
