Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is 1, k is 0, ans1 is a list containing four copies of the largest integer from b, ans2 is an empty list, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b or an empty list depending on whether the first two elements of b are different, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
