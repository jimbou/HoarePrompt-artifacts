Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, `req` is 2k, `k` is either -2 or non-zero minus one, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from b, the ith element of l, and the ith element of l, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of each pair of equal consecutive elements from c, the ith element of l, and the ith element of l, `i` is 2, and `l` is either a list containing the smallest integer from b and the largest integer from b, a list containing the largest integer from b, a list containing the smallest integer from b and the ith element of b, and must have at least 3 elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
