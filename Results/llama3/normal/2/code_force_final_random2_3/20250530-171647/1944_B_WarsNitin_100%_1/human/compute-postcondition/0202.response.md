Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is 2k, `i` is 1, `k` is either -1 or non-zero, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from `b` and the ith element of `l`, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of each pair of equal consecutive elements from `c` and the ith element of `l`, and `l` is either a list containing the smallest integer from `b` and the largest integer from `b`, a list containing the largest integer from `b`, a list containing the smallest integer from `b` and the ith element of `b`, and must have at least 2 elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
