Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `req` is equal to 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
