Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is n - 1, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, l is an empty list, k is 2 times the value of k from the input**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `req` is updated to `2k`, where `k` is the value from the input. The lists `ans1`, `ans2`, and `l` are reset to empty lists. The value of `k` is updated to twice its original value from the input.
