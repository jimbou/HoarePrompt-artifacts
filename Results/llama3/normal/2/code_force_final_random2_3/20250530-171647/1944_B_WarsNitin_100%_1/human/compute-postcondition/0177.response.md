Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is n - 1, k is 2k, If k is 0, ans1 is a list containing four copies of the largest integer from b, ans2 is an empty list, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b or an empty list depending on whether the first two elements of b are different. If k is not 0, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from b, ans2 is an empty list, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b and the largest integer from b, a list containing the largest integer from b, a list containing the smallest integer from b and the ith element of b, or an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that k is now equal to req, which is 2k. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
