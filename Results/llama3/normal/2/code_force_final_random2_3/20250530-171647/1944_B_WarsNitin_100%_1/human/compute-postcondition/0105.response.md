Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is -2n, `i` is 3. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing either six copies of the current value of `b[i]`, four copies of the current value of `b[i]`, or two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, and `k` is either -6, -4, or -2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is either a list containing four copies of the current value of `b[i]`, a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, or an empty list, and `k` is either -4 or -2. Additionally, if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
