Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is 1. The current value of c[i] is equal to the current value of c[i - 1]. If k is 0, ans1 is a list containing four copies of the largest integer from b, ans2 is an empty list, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b or an empty list depending on whether the first two elements of b are different, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If k is not 0, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from b, ans2 is an empty list, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b and the largest integer from b, a list containing the largest integer from b, a list containing the smallest integer from b and the ith element of b, or an empty list.**
