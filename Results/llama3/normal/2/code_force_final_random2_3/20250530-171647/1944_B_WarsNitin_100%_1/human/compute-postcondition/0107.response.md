Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is -2n, `i` is n - 1, `k` is -2n. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing 2n copies of the current value of `b[i]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing 2n - 2 copies of the current value of `b[i]`. Additionally, if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be equal to `req`, which is -2n. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans1` and `l` are still dependent on the values of `b[i]`, `b[i - 1]`, and `b[i + 1]`.
