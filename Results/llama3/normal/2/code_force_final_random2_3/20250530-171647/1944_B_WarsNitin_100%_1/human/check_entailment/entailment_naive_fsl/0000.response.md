Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

4
2 1
1 2 2 1
6 1
6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
6 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

The program outputs:

2 1
2 1
6 4
1 3
1 2
1 2
5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4

However, the correct output should be:

2 1
2 1
6 4
1 3
1 2
1 2
5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when k is greater than n/2. In this case, the program should output two arrays of length 2k, but the program only outputs two arrays of length k.

The program also does not correctly handle the case when the input array a contains duplicate elements. In this case, the program should output two arrays that are subsets of the input array a, but the program may output arrays that contain duplicate elements.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when k is greater than n/2 and to correctly handle the case when the input array a contains duplicate elements.
