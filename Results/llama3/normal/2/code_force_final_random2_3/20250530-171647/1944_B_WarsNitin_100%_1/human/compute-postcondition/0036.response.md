Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the `n`th smallest integer from `a`, and `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k` minus 2 times the number of pairs of equal adjacent elements in `b`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the `n`th smallest integer from `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The loop has iterated `n-2` times, and the value of `i` is now `n-1`.
- If `k` is 0, the loop has terminated.
- If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains two copies of the `n`th smallest integer from `a`, and `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k` minus 2 times the number of pairs of equal adjacent elements in `b`.
- If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` contains the `n`th smallest integer from `a`.
- The values of `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
