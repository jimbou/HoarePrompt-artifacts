Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is n - 1. If the first two elements of b are different, l is a list containing the smallest integer from b and the largest integer from b, and k is 2 times the value of k from the input. Otherwise, l is a list containing the largest integer from b and k is 2 times the value of k from the input. If the first two elements of b are the same, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from b, ans2 is an empty list, k is req - 4, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b or an empty list depending on whether the first two elements of b are different. Otherwise, ans1 and ans2 remain empty lists.***
