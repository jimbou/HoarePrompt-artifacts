Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is 2. If k is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
