Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is len(l) - 1, k is either -len(l) or non-zero minus len(l) + 1, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from b and all elements of l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each pair of equal consecutive elements from c and all elements of l, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b and the largest integer from b, a list containing the largest integer from b, a list containing the smallest integer from b and the ith element of b.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will continue to iterate until it has processed all elements in the list `l`. The value of `i` will be the last index of `l`, `k` will be either `-len(l)` or `non-zero minus len(l) + 1`, and `ans1` and `ans2` will contain all elements of `l` in addition to their initial values. The other variables remain unchanged.
