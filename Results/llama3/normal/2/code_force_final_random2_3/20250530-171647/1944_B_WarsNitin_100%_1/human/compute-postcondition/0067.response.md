Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is -2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list containing `l[i]` and `l[i]`, `ans2` is a list containing `l[i]` and `l[i]`, `req` is 0, `i` is 2, `l` is a list that must have at least 3 elements. If `k` equals 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.***
