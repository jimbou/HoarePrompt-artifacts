Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is -2n, `i` is 1. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
