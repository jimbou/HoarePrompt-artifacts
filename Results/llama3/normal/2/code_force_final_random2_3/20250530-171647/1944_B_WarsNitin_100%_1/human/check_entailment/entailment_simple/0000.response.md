Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}.

2. The program correctly initializes the variables b and c as the first n and the remaining n integers of a, respectively, and sorts them in ascending order.

3. The program correctly identifies the pairs of equal consecutive elements in b and c, and adds them to ans1 and ans2, respectively. This is because the XOR of two equal numbers is 0, so these pairs do not affect the overall XOR of the arrays.

4. The program correctly identifies the remaining elements in b that are not part of any pair, and adds them to l. These elements are the ones that will contribute to the XOR of the arrays.

5. The program correctly adds the elements of l to ans1 and ans2, ensuring that the XOR of the elements in ans1 is equal to the XOR of the elements in ans2.

6. Finally, the program correctly prints the elements of ans1 and ans2, which are the required arrays l and r.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
