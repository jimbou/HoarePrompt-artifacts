Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is n - 1. If the first two elements of b are different, l is a list containing the smallest integer from b and the largest integer from b, and k is 2 times the value of k from the input. Otherwise, l is a list containing the largest integer from b and k is 2 times the value of k from the input. If the first two elements of b are the same, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from b, ans2 is an empty list, k is req - 4, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b or an empty list depending on whether the first two elements of b are different. Otherwise, ans1 and ans2 remain empty lists.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is 1. If the ith element of b is equal to the (i-1)th element of b, ans1 is a list containing four copies of the largest integer from b, ans2 is an empty list, k is req - 6, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b or an empty list depending on whether the first two elements of b are different. If the ith element of b is not equal to the (i-1)th element of b, k is either 2 times the value of k from the input or req - 4, l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b and the largest integer from b, a list containing the largest integer from b, a list containing the smallest integer from b and the ith element of b, or an empty list, ans1 is either a list containing two copies of the largest integer from b or an empty list, ans2 is either an empty list or a list containing the ith element of b.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is 2k, `i` is 2. If the ith element of `b` is equal to the (i-1)th element of `b`, `ans1` is a list containing four copies of the largest integer from `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `req` - 6, and `l` is either a list containing the smallest integer from `b` or an empty list depending on whether the first two elements of `b` are different. If the ith element of `b` is not equal to the (i-1)th element of `b`, `k` is either 2 times the value of `k` from the input or `req` - 4, `l` is either a list containing the smallest integer from `b` and the largest integer from `b`, a list containing the largest integer from `b`, a list containing the smallest integer from `b` and the ith element of `b`, or an empty list, `ans1` is either a list containing two copies of the largest integer from `b` or an empty list, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list containing the ith element of `b. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is 2k, `i` is 3. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the ith element of `b` is equal to the (i-1)th element of `b`, `ans1` is a list containing four copies of the largest integer from `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, and `k` is `req` - 6. If the ith element of `b` is not equal to the (i-1)th element of `b`, `k` is either 2 times the value of `k` from the input or `req` - 4, `ans1` is either a list containing two copies of the largest integer from `b` or an empty list, and `ans2` is either an empty list or a list containing the ith element of `b. `l` is either a list containing the smallest integer from `b` and the ith element of `b`, a list containing the smallest integer from `b` and the largest integer from `b`, a list containing the largest integer from `b` and the ith element of `b`, a list containing the largest integer from `b`, a list containing the smallest integer from `b`, or a list containing the smallest integer from `b` and the largest integer from `b` and the ith element of `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
