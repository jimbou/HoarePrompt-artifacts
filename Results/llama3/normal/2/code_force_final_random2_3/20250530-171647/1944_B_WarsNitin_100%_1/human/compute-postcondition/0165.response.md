Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is 2, ans1 is a list containing four copies of the largest integer from b if the ith element of b is equal to the (i-1)th element of b, otherwise ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from b, ans2 is an empty list if the ith element of b is equal to the (i-1)th element of b, otherwise ans2 is a list containing the ith element of b, k is req - 6 if the ith element of b is equal to the (i-1)th element of b, otherwise k is either 2 times the value of k from the input or req - 4, l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b if the first two elements of b are different, otherwise l is an empty list if the ith element of b is equal to the (i-1)th element of b, otherwise l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b and the largest integer from b, a list containing the largest integer from b, a list containing the smallest integer from b and the ith element of b, or an empty list.**
