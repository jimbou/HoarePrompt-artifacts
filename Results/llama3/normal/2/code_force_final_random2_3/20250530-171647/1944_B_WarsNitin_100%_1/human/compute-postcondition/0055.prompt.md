Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the `n`th smallest integer from `a`, and `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k` minus 2 times the number of pairs of equal adjacent elements in `b`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` is a list containing the `n`th smallest integer from `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` has two additional elements equal to the element at index `i` in list `c`, `k` is either -2 or 2 times its original value minus 2, and `req` is either 0 or 2 times the original value of `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans2`, `k`, or `req`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` has two additional elements equal to the element at index `i` in list `c`, `k` is either -2 or 2 times its original value minus 2, and `req` is either 0 or 2 times the original value of `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans2`, `k`, or `req`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` has two additional elements equal to the element at index `i` in list `c`, `k` is either -4 or 0, and `req` is either 0 or 2 times the original value of `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans2`, `k`, or `req`, `i` is 2. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
