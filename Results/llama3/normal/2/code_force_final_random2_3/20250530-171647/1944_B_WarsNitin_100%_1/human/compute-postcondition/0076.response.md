Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is -2n, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is -2n, `i` is n - 1, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer from the first n integers of list a, and a list of n copies of the nth element of list l is no longer being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the smallest integer from the first n integers of list a, which is `b[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
