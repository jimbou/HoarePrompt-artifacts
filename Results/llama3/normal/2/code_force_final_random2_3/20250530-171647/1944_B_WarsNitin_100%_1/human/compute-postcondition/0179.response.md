Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is 1, k is 0, the current value of ans1 is a list containing four copies of the largest integer from b, ans2 is an empty list, and the current value of l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b or an empty list depending on whether the first two elements of b are different.**
