Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer equal to 2 times its original value, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`, `l` is a list containing the first and last elements of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the last element of `b`, which is `b[n - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The first element of `b` is still not equal to the second element of `b`, and the current value of `b[n - 2]` is still not equal to the current value of `b[n - 1]`.
