Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is 2k, `i` is 1. If the ith element of `b` is not equal to the (i-1)th element of `b`, `k` is either 2 times the value of k from the input or req - 4, `l` is either a list containing the smallest integer from `b` and the largest integer from `b`, a list containing the largest integer from `b`, a list containing the smallest integer from `b` and the ith element of b, or an empty list, `ans1` is either a list containing two copies of the largest integer from `b` or an empty list, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list containing the ith element of b. Otherwise, `k` is 2 times the value of k from the input, `l` is a list containing the largest integer from `b`, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, and `l` is either a list containing the smallest integer from `b` or an empty list depending on whether the first two elements of `b` are different.***
