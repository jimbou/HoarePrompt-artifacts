Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is -2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list containing `l[i]` and `l[i]`, `ans2` is a list containing `l[i]` and `l[i]`, `req` is 0, `i` is 2, `l` is a list that must have at least 3 elements and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases.
