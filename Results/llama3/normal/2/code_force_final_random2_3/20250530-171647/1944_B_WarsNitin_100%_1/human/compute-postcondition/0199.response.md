Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is 2k, `i` is 0, `k` is either 0 or non-zero, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from `b`, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of each pair of equal consecutive elements from `c`, and `l` is either a list containing the smallest integer from `b` and the largest integer from `b`, a list containing the largest integer from `b`, a list containing the smallest integer from `b` and the ith element of `b`, and must have at least 1 element. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
