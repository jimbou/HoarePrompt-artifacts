Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is n - 1. If k is 0, ans1 is a list containing four copies of the largest integer from b, ans2 is an empty list, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b or an empty list depending on whether the first two elements of b are different. If k is not 0, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the largest integer from b, ans2 is an empty list, and l is either a list containing the smallest integer from b and the largest integer from b, a list containing the largest integer from b, a list containing the smallest integer from b and the ith element of b, or an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows: The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n-1` or `k` becomes 0. If `k` becomes 0, the loop will break, and `ans1` will contain four copies of the largest integer from `b`, `ans2` will be an empty list, and `l` will be either a list containing the smallest integer from `b` or an empty list, depending on whether the first two elements of `b` are different. If `k` is not 0, `ans1` will contain two copies of the largest integer from `b`, `ans2` will be an empty list, and `l` will be either a list containing the smallest integer from `b` and the largest integer from `b`, a list containing the largest integer from `b`, a list containing the smallest integer from `b` and the ith element of `b`, or an empty list.
