Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `req` is equal to 2 times the original value of `k`, `i` is 3. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `l` is a list that contains the 4th element of `b`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes.***
