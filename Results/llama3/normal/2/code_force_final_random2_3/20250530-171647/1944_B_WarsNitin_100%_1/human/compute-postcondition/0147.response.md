Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is n - 1, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list. If the first two elements of b are different, l is a list containing the smallest integer from b and k is 2 times the value of k from the input. Otherwise, l remains an empty list.***
