Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `q` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `req` is 2k, `i` is `n` - 1, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing the smallest integer from `b`, `k` is 2 times the value of k from the input.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to contain the smallest integer from the sorted list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
