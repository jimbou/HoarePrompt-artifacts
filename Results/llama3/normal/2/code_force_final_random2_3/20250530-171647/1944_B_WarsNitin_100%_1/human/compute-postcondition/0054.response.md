Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is a sorted list of the remaining integers from `a`, `ans1` is a list. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` has two additional elements equal to the element at index `i` in list `c`, `k` is either -4 or 0, and `req` is either 0 or 2 times the original value of `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans2`, `k`, or `req`, `i` is 2. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
