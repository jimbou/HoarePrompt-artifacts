Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, q is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer greater than 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of the first n integers from a, c is a sorted list of the remaining integers from a, req is 2k, i is 3. If the 4th element of c is equal to the 3rd element of c, then ans2 is a list containing two copies of the 4th element of c and k is two less than its original value. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
