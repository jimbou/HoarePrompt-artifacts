To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(k):`. The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `k`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `k` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 2
* `k` must be greater than 2

The other variables in the state (`test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, and `combined`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()` where `k` is at least 3, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with two less tuples than before. Otherwise, `heap` and `remaining_items` remain empty.**
