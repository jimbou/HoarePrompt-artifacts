Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 3, `k` is greater than 3, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has two less items, `item` is undefined, `removed_item` is undefined, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `test_cases`, `_`, `k`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `item`, `removed_item`, `current_profit`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged. The `heap` now contains one tuple from the `combined` list, and the `combined` list has two less items.
