Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to k, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the k smallest tuples from `combined` and `combined` has k less items. `remaining_items` is empty, and the current value of `max_profit` is equal to the current value of `current_profit` which is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `max_profit` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `current_profit`, which is greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their previous values and relationships.
