The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pushes the smallest item from the `combined` list into the `heap`. Since `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, the smallest item is the one with the smallest `neg_prices` value.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to 0, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from `combined`, `item` is undefined, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` with one less item, `remaining_items` is empty, and `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
