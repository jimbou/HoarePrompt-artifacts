Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to k, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` with at least one less item, `heap` contains the k smallest tuples from `combined` with the last tuple `item` from `combined` replaced by `removed_item`, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last tuple from `combined` that was popped, `removed_item` is the tuple that was removed from the heap, and `max_profit` is either 0 or equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than 0 and `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains 0. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`.**

The code pops the last item from the `combined` list and assigns it to the `item` variable. The `combined` list now has at least one less item. The other variables remain unchanged.
