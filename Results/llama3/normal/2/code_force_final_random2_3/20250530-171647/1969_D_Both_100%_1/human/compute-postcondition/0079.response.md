Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last element of `combined`, `removed_item` is undefined, `combined` has one less element, `current_profit` is updated to be `current_profit - item[1]`, and `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit - item[1]` if `current_profit - item[1]` is greater than `max_profit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `current_profit` is decreased by the value of `item[1]`. The value of `max_profit` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the new value of `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged.
