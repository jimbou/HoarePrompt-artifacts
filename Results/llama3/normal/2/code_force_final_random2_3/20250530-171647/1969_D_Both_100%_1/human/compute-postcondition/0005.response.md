The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pushes the smallest tuple from the sorted list `combined` into the heap. Since `combined` is sorted by `bonuses`, the smallest tuple will be the one with the smallest `bonus` value. 

The `combined` list is not empty, so it will always have at least one tuple to pop. After popping the smallest tuple, the size of `combined` will decrease by 1.

The heap is initially empty, so after pushing the smallest tuple from `combined`, it will contain one tuple.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()` where `k` is at least 1, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before.**
