Output State: **test_cases is greater than 0, _ is equal to k + 1, n and k are the return values of func_2(), prices is a list of values returned by func_2(), neg_prices is a list of negative values of prices, bonuses is a list of values returned by func_2(), heap is empty, item is undefined, combined is a sorted list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, remaining_items is empty, and max_profit is 0, current_profit is 0.**

The code initializes several variables and data structures, but does not modify the initial state of `test_cases`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `heap`, `item`, `remaining_items`, and `max_profit`. The `combined` list is created by zipping `neg_prices` and `bonuses` together and sorting the result based on the `bonuses` values. The `max_profit` and `current_profit` variables are initialized to 0.
