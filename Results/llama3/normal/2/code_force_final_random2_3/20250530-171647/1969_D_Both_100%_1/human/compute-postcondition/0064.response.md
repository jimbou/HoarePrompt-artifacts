Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has two less items, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is undefined, `removed_item` is undefined, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0**

In this output state, the code has pushed one tuple from the `combined` list into the `heap` using `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())`. The `combined` list now has two less items because `pop()` removes one item from the list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
