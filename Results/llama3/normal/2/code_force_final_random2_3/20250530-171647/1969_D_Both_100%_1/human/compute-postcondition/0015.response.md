Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with `k` less tuples than before.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, and the variable `_` is still equal to `k`. The values of `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` are still the same as before. The maximum profit is still 0. The current profit is now the return value of the function `func_3` called with the arguments `combined` and `heap`. The list `combined` is still not empty, and the heap still contains `k` tuples from `combined`. The list `remaining_items` is still empty. The list `combined` is still sorted by bonuses, but it has `k` less tuples than before.
