Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` has one less element. The current value of `removed_item` is not empty. `current_profit` is decreased by the value of `removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the value of `removed_item[0]`. The value of `max_profit` is either 0 or the updated value of `current_profit` if it is greater than the previous value of `max_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged.
