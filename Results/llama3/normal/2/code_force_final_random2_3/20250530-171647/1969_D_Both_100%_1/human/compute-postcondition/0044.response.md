The only variable in the loop head is variable combined, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable combined.  If combined is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, combined is a sorted list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, sorted by bonuses, with one less tuple than before. So for the loop to be executed one more time combined must not be empty.
State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap` after pushing `item` into it and popping the smallest tuple, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, and is not empty, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`. If the sum of the elements of the last tuple removed from `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of the last tuple removed from `combined`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of the last tuple removed from `combined`. If `removed_item` is not empty, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of the `removed_item` tuple. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.**
