The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `k`. If `_` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 2.
State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to 2, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from `combined` and `combined` has one less item. `remaining_items` is empty, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `k` is greater than 2**
