To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `_` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()` that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()` where `k` must be at least 1, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`**
