Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `item` is the last tuple from `combined`, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap` or `item` if `item` is smaller than the smallest tuple in `heap`, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` plus the first element of `item`.**

The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` removes the smallest tuple from the heap and adds the new item to the heap. The removed item is either the smallest tuple from the heap or the new item if the new item is smaller than the smallest tuple in the heap. The heap still contains k tuples from the combined list. The combined list has one less tuple than before. The values of the other variables are not affected.
