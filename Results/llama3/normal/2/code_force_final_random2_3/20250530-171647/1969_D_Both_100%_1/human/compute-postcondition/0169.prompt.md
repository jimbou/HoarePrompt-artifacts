Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()`, which is unknown since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    heap = []
    remaining_items = []
    n, k = func_2()
    prices = list(func_2())
    neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
    bonuses = list(func_2())
    max_profit = 0
    current_profit = 0
    combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
    combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
    for _ in range(k):
        if combined:
            heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
    if combined:
        current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit
    while combined:
        item = combined.pop()
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            current_profit -= item[1]
        else:
            current_profit += item[0]
        removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
        if removed_item:
            current_profit -= removed_item[0]
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
    print(max_profit)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is an empty list, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap`, `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` minus the sum of the second elements of the tuples removed from `combined` if the sum of the elements of the tuples removed from `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` plus the sum of the first elements of the tuples removed from `combined`, minus the sum of the first elements of the `removed_item` tuples. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`, and max_profit is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` is empty, `item` is undefined, `combined` is empty, `remaining_items` is empty, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items in the `combined` list, and the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items in the `combined` list which is max_profit is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to k, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `heap` is empty, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last tuple from `combined` that was popped, `removed_item` is the tuple that was removed from the heap, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items with the given prices and bonuses, and the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items with the given prices and bonuses is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
