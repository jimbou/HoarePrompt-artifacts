Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has one less item, `item` is undefined, `removed_item` is undefined, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0**

The code pushes one tuple from the `combined` list into the `heap` using `heapq.heappush`. Since `combined` is a sorted list, the smallest tuple (based on the first element of the tuple) is removed from `combined` and added to the `heap`. The other variables remain unchanged.
