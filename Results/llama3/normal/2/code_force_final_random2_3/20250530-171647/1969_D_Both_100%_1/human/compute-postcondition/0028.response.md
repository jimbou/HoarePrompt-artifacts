Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `item` is the last tuple from `combined`, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap` or `item` if `item` is smaller than the smallest tuple in `heap`, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` plus the first element of `item`. The current value of `removed_item` is not empty.***
