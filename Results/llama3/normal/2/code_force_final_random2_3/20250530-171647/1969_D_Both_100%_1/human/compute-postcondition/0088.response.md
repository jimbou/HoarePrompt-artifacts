Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` has one less element. `removed_item` is empty, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, and `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` is no longer true because `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0. The variable `_` is still equal to `k`. The values of `n` and `k` are still the return values of the function `func_2()`. The lists `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` still contain the values returned by `func_2()`. The heap still contains `k` tuples from the list `combined`. The list `remaining_items` is still empty. The variable `item` is still the last element of the list `combined`, and `combined` still has one less element. The variable `removed_item` is still empty. The value of `max_profit` is now equal to the value of `current_profit`, and the statement that `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` is no longer true because `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`.
