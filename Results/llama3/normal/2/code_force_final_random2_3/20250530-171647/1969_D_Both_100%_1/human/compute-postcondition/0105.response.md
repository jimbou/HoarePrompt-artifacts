Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` has at least 1 element, `remaining_items` is empty, `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, and `removed_item` is the smallest tuple in `heap` or `item` if `item` is smaller than the smallest tuple in `heap`.**

In this output state, the code has removed the smallest tuple from the heap and added the last element of `combined` to the heap. The smallest tuple is either the smallest tuple in the heap or the last element of `combined` if it is smaller than the smallest tuple in the heap. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
