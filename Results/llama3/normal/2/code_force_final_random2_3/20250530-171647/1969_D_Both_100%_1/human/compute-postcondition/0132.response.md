The only variable in the loop head is variable `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `combined`. If `combined` is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`. So for the loop to execute the first time, `combined` must not be empty.

State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to k, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, `heap` contains the k smallest tuples from `combined` and `combined` has k less items, `remaining_items` is empty, and `max_profit` is either 0 or equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains 0.**
