Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `item` is the second last element of `combined`, `combined` has at least 1 element, `remaining_items` is empty, and `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. If `removed_item` is True, `current_profit` is decreased by the value of the second last element of `combined` if the sum of the values of the second last element of `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, or increased by the value of the second last element of `combined` if the sum of the values of the second last element of `combined` is less than 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `current_profit`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.***
