Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to k, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` with one less item, `heap` contains the k smallest tuples from `combined` with the last tuple `item` from `combined` replaced by `removed_item`, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last tuple from `combined` that was popped, `removed_item` is the tuple that was removed from the heap, and `max_profit` is either 0 or equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains 0. If the sum of the elements in the last tuple `item` from `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`. If the sum of the elements in the last tuple `item` from `combined` is less than 0, then `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the heap now contains the k smallest tuples from the combined list, with the last tuple replaced by the removed item. The removed item is the tuple that was removed from the heap. The max profit remains the same unless the current profit is greater than 0, in which case it is updated. The current profit is updated based on the sum of the elements in the last tuple from the combined list.
