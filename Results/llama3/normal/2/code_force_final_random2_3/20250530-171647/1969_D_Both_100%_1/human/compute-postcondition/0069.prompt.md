Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is greater than 0, _ is equal to k plus 1, n and k are the return values of func_2(), prices is a list of values returned by func_2(), neg_prices is a list of negative values of prices, bonuses is a list of values returned by func_2(), heap is empty, remaining_items is empty, combined is a sorted list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, item is undefined, removed_item is undefined, current_profit is 0, max_profit is 0
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, if `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has one less item. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. `item` is undefined, `removed_item` is undefined, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, if `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has one less item if `combined` is not empty, otherwise two less items if `combined` is not empty, `item` is undefined, `removed_item` is undefined, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 3, `k` is greater than 3, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has two less items. Otherwise, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has one less item.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
