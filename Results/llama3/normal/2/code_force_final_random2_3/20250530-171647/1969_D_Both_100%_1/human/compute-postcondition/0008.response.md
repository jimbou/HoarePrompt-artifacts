Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()` where `k` is at least 1, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with two less tuples than before.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `test_cases`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, and `current_profit` remain unchanged. The `heap` now contains one tuple from the `combined` list, which is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`. The `combined` list has two less tuples than before, and `remaining_items` is still an empty list.
