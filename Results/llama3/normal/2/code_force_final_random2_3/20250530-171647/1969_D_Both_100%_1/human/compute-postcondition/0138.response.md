Postcondition: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to k, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` with one less item, `heap` contains the k smallest tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last tuple from `combined` that was popped, and `max_profit` is either 0 or equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains 0. If the sum of the elements in the last tuple `item` from `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`. If the sum of the elements in the last tuple `item` from `combined` is less than 0, then `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`.**
