To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(k):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `k`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `k` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `k` needs to remain at least 1.

State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()` where `k` is at least 1, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before. Otherwise, `heap` and `remaining_items` remain empty.**
