Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` plus the first element of `item`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `item` is the last tuple from `combined`, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before. Additionally, the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is less than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated by adding the first element of `item` to its previous value, which was the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their previous values and relationships as specified in the initial state.
