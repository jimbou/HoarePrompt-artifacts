Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap` after pushing `item` into it and popping the smallest tuple, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, and has one less tuple than before, and is not empty, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined` and is the last tuple of the original `combined` list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `item` is updated to be the last tuple of the original `combined` list, and the `combined` list now has one less tuple than before. All other variables remain unchanged.
