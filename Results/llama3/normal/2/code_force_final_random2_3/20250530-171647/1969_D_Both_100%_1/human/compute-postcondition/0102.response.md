Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` has at least 1 element, `remaining_items` is empty, and `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. `current_profit` is decreased by the value of the last element of `combined` if the sum of the values of the last element of `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, or increased by the value of the last element of `combined` if the sum of the values of the last element of `combined` is less than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated based on the value of the last element of `combined`. If the sum of the values of the last element of `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` has been decreased by that value. If the sum of the values of the last element of `combined` is less than 0, `current_profit` has been increased by that value. The other variables remain unchanged.
