Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is an empty list, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap`, `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` minus the sum of the second elements of the tuples removed from `combined` if the sum of the elements of the tuples removed from `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` plus the sum of the first elements of the tuples removed from `combined`, minus the sum of the first elements of the `removed_item` tuples. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The loop has executed until the `combined` list is empty.
*   The `heap` still contains `k` tuples from the original `combined` list.
*   The `current_profit` has been updated based on the tuples removed from `combined` and the `removed_item` tuples.
*   If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` has been updated to be equal to `current_profit`.
*   The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
