Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has `k` less items, `item` is undefined, `removed_item` is undefined. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` has one less element. If `removed_item` is not empty, `current_profit` is decreased by the value of `removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. If `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is updated to be `current_profit - item[1]`, and `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit - item[1]` if `current_profit - item[1]` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, if `item[0] + item[1]` is less than 0, then `current_profit` is increased by the value of `item[0]`, and if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains 0. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `item` is the second last element of `combined`, `combined` has at least 1 element, `remaining_items` is empty, and `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. If `removed_item` is True, `current_profit` is decreased by the value of the second last element of `combined` if the sum of the values of the second last element of `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, or increased by the value of the second last element of `combined` if the sum of the values of the second last element of `combined` is less than 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `current_profit`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` has at least 1 element, `remaining_items` is empty, and if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` and if `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
