Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to k, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has k less items, `heap` contains the k smallest tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `max_profit` is 0, and `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated to be the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`, which means it now holds the result of the function call with the current `combined` and `heap` as arguments. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their previous values and properties as specified in the initial state.
