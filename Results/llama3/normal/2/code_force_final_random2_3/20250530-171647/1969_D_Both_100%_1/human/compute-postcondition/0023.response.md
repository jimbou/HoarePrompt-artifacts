Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `item` is the last tuple from `combined`, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before. The current value of `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the value of `item[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
