Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has `k` less items, `item` is undefined, `removed_item` is undefined, `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `max_profit` is 0. The list `combined` is not empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `current_profit` has been updated to the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `combined` still contains tuples of negative prices and bonuses, and the heap still contains `k` tuples from `combined`. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `item`, `removed_item`, and `max_profit` remain the same as before.
