Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` has at least 1 element, `remaining_items` is empty, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, and if `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their previous values and relationships. The state of `removed_item` and its impact on `current_profit` is still conditional, depending on whether `removed_item` exists or not.
