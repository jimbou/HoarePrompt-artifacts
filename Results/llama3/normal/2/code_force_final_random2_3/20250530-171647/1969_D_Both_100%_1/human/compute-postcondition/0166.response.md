Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to k, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `heap` is empty, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last tuple from `combined` that was popped, `removed_item` is the tuple that was removed from the heap, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items with the given prices and bonuses.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `combined` list is empty, indicating that all items have been processed. The `heap` is also empty, as all items have been removed and processed. The `remaining_items` list remains empty, as no items were added to it during the loop iterations. The `item` variable holds the last tuple that was popped from the `combined` list, and the `removed_item` variable holds the last tuple that was removed from the heap. The `max_profit` variable holds the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items with the given prices and bonuses, which is the result of the loop's execution.
