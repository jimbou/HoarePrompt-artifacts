Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap` after pushing `item` into it and popping the smallest tuple, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before, and `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`. If the sum of the elements of the last tuple removed from `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of the last tuple removed from `combined`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of the last tuple removed from `combined`.**

In this output state, the `removed_item` has been updated to be the smallest tuple from the `heap` after pushing the `item` into it and popping the smallest tuple. The `heap` still contains `k` tuples from `combined`. The other variables remain unchanged.
