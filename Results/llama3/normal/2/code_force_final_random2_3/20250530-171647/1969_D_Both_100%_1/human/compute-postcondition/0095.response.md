Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `removed_item` is the second last element of `combined`, `item` is the second last element of `combined`, `combined` has at least 1 element, `remaining_items` is empty, and `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. If the sum of the values of the second last element of `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is either decreased by the value of the second last element of `combined` if the second last element of `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, or increased by the value of the second last element of `combined` if the second last element of `combined` is less than 0. Otherwise, `current_profit` is either increased by the value of the second last element of `combined` if the second last element of `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, or decreased by the value of the second last element of `combined` if the second last element of `combined` is less than 0.**

The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` removes the smallest item from the heap and adds the new item to the heap, maintaining the heap property. The removed item is assigned to the variable `removed_item`. The heap still contains `k` tuples from `combined`. The value of `item` is still the second last element of `combined`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
