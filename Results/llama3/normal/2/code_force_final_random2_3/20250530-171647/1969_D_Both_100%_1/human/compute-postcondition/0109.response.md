Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` has at least 1 element, `remaining_items` is empty, and if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` and if `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
