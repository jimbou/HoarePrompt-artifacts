The code prints the value of `max_profit`, which is the maximum profit that can be obtained by removing tuples from `combined` and adding them to `heap`, considering the conditions for updating `current_profit` and `max_profit`.

Output: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `combined` is an empty list, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap`, `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` minus the sum of the second elements of the tuples removed from `combined` if the sum of the elements of the tuples removed from `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` plus the sum of the first elements of the tuples removed from `combined`, minus the sum of the first elements of the `removed_item` tuples. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`, and max_profit is printed**
