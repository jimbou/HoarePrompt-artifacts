Output State: **test_cases is greater than 0, _ is equal to k, n and k are the return values of func_2(), prices is a list of values returned by func_2(), neg_prices is a list of negative values of prices, bonuses is a list of values returned by func_2(), max_profit is 0, current_profit is 0. If combined is not empty, heap contains k tuples from combined, remaining_items is an empty list, and combined is a sorted list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, sorted by bonuses, with k less tuples than before. Otherwise, heap and remaining_items remain empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated k times, and the value of _ has been incremented to k. If the combined list is not empty, the heap now contains k tuples from the combined list, and the combined list has been reduced by k tuples. The remaining variables remain unchanged.
