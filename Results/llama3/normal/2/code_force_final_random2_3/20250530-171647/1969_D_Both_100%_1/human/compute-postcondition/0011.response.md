Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()` where `k` is at least 3, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before.**

In this output state, the code has pushed one tuple from the `combined` list into the `heap` using `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())`. The `combined` list now has one less tuple than before. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
