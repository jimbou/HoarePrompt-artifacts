Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with `k` less tuples than before.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `max_profit` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `current_profit`, which is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `test_cases` still greater than 0, `_` still equal to `k`, `n` and `k` still the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` still a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` still a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` still a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` still containing `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` still an empty list, and `combined` still a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with `k` less tuples than before.
