The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 1.
State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to 1, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from `combined` and `combined` has one less item. `remaining_items` is empty, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `k` is greater than 1**
