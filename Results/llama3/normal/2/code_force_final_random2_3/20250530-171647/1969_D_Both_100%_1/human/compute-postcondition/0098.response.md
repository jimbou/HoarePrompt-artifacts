Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `item` is the second last element of `combined`, `combined` has at least 1 element, `remaining_items` is empty, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, and `current_profit` is either decreased by the value of the second last element of `combined` if `removed_item` is True and the sum of the values of the second last element of `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, or increased by the value of the second last element of `combined` if `removed_item` is True and the sum of the values of the second last element of `combined` is less than 0, otherwise `current_profit` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `removed_item` and the update of `current_profit` are still applicable.
