Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap` after pushing `item` into it and popping the smallest tuple, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, and has one less tuple than before, and is not empty, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined` and is the last tuple of the original `combined` list, and `current_profit` is decreased by the bonus value of the last removed item.**

In this output state, all variables retain their previous values, except for `current_profit`, which is decreased by the bonus value of the last removed item (`item[1]`). The bonus value is the second element of the tuple `item`, which is the last tuple that was removed from the sorted list `combined`.
