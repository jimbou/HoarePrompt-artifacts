Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap` after pushing `item` into it and popping the smallest tuple, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`. If the sum of the elements of the last tuple removed from `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of the last tuple removed from `combined`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of the last tuple removed from `combined`. If `removed_item` is not empty, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of the `removed_item` tuple. `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `max_profit` is now equal to the current value of `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged.
