Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`, and `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their previous values, except for `current_profit`, which is updated by adding the first element of the `item` tuple. The `item` tuple is the last one removed from the `combined` list, and its first element is added to `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged.
