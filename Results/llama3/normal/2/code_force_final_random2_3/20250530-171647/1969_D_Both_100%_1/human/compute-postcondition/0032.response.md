Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `item` is the last tuple from `combined`, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap` or `item` if `item` is smaller than the smallest tuple in `heap`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, and the current value of `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The code assigns the value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. The `max_profit` is now equal to the current value of `current_profit`, which is greater than the previous value of `max_profit`. All other conditions and values of variables remain the same as in the initial state.
