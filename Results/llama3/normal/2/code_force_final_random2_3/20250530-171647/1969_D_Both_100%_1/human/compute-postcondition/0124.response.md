Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to 2, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from `combined` and `combined` has one less item. `remaining_items` is empty, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `k` is greater than 2. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from `combined` and the second smallest tuple from `combined`.***
