Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to k, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` with one less item, `heap` contains the k smallest tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last tuple from `combined` that was popped, and `max_profit` is either 0 or equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains 0.**

In this output state, the code has removed the last item from the `combined` list and assigned it to the variable `item`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `test_cases`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, and `max_profit` are still valid.
