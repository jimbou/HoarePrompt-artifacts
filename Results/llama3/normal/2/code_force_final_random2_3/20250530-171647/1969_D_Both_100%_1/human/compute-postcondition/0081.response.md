Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last element of `combined`, `removed_item` is undefined, `combined` has one less element, If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains 0. Additionally, the sum of `item[0]` and `item[1]` is less than 0, and `current_profit` is increased by the value of `item[0]`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, except for `current_profit`, which is increased by the value of `item[0]`. The sum of `item[0]` and `item[1]` is still less than 0, indicating that the item's price and bonus have a negative total value. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, including `test_cases`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `item`, `removed_item`, and `combined`.
