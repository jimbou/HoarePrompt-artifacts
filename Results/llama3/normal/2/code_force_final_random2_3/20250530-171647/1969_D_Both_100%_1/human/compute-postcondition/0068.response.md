Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 3, `k` is greater than 3, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has two less items. Otherwise, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has one less item.***
