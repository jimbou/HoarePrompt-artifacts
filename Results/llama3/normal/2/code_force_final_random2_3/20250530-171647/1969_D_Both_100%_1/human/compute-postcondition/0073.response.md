Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has `k` less items, `item` is undefined, `removed_item` is undefined. If `combined` is not empty, the current value of `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` and is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise the current value of `current_profit` is 0. `max_profit` is 0.***
