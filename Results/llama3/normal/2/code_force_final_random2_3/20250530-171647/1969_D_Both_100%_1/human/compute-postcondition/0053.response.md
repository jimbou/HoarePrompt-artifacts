Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, and has one less tuple than before, and is not empty, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined` and is the last tuple of the original `combined` list. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`. Otherwise, no change is made to `current_profit`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.***
