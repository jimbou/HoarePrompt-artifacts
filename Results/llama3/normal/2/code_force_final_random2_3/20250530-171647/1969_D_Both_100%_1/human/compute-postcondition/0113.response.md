The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is equal to `k + 1`.
State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k + 1`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` is empty, `item` is undefined, `combined` is empty, `remaining_items` is empty, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items in the `combined` list, and the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items in the `combined` list which is max_profit is being printed**
