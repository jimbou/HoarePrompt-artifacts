Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to 1, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` with one less item, `heap` contains the smallest tuple from `combined` and the second smallest tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, and `k` is greater than 1**

In this output state, the code has pushed the smallest tuple from `combined` into `heap` and removed it from `combined`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The `heap` now contains the smallest tuple from `combined` and the second smallest tuple from `combined`. The `combined` list has one less item.
