Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap` after pushing `item` into it and popping the smallest tuple, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`, and `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of the `removed_item` tuple.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the first element of the `removed_item` tuple from it. All other variables remain unchanged.
