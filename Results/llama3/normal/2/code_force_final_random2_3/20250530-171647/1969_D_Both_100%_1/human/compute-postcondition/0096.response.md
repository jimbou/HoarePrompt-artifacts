Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `item` is the second last element of `combined`, `combined` has at least 1 element, `remaining_items` is empty, and `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. `current_profit` is decreased by the value of the second last element of `combined` if the sum of the values of the second last element of `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, or increased by the value of the second last element of `combined` if the sum of the values of the second last element of `combined` is less than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0. The variable `_` is still equal to `k`. The variables `n` and `k` are still the return values of the function `func_2()`. The lists `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` still contain values returned by `func_2()`. The heap still contains `k` tuples from `combined`. The variable `item` is still the second last element of `combined`. The list `combined` still has at least 1 element. The list `remaining_items` is still empty. The variable `max_profit` is still either 0 or `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. The variable `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the value of the second last element of `combined`. If the sum of the values of the second last element of `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` has been decreased by this value. Otherwise, `current_profit` has been increased by this value.
