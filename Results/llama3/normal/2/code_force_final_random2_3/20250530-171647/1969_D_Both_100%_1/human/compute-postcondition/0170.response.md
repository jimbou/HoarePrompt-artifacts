Functionality: **This function determines the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items with given prices and bonuses. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the maximum profit for each test case. The function iterates over a number of test cases, and for each test case, it generates a list of prices and bonuses, sorts them based on the bonuses, and then simulates a process of buying and selling items to maximize the profit. The function uses a heap data structure to keep track of the items with the highest bonuses and updates the maximum profit as it processes the items.**
