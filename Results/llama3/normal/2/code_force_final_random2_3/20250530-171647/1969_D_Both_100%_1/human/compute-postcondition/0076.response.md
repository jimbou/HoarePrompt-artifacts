The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `combined` being not empty. Right before the loop, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has `k` less items. This does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `combined` is not empty.

State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `combined` is not empty, `item` is undefined, `removed_item` is undefined. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains 0.**
