Output State: **test_cases is the return value of func_1() that must be greater than 0, _ is 0, heap is an empty list, remaining_items is an empty list, n and k are the return values of func_2(), prices is a list of values returned by func_2(), neg_prices is a list of negative values of prices, bonuses is a list of values returned by func_2(), max_profit is 0, current_profit is 0, combined is a sorted list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, sorted by bonuses.**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The initial state of `test_cases` and `_` remains unchanged. Two empty lists, `heap` and `remaining_items`, are created. The function `func_2()` is called twice, and its return values are assigned to `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses`. A new list `neg_prices` is created by negating the values in `prices`. The lists `neg_prices` and `bonuses` are combined into a list of tuples, sorted by the values in `bonuses`. The variables `max_profit` and `current_profit` are initialized to 0.
