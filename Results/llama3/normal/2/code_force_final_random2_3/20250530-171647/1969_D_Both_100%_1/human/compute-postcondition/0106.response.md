Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` has at least 1 element, `remaining_items` is empty, `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, and `removed_item` is the smallest tuple in `heap` or `item` if `item` is smaller than the smallest tuple in `heap`, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `current_profit` has been decreased by the first element of `removed_item`. All other variables remain unchanged.
