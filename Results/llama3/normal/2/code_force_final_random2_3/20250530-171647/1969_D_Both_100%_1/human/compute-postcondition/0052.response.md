Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, and has one less tuple than before, and is not empty, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined` and is the last tuple of the original `combined` list. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`. Otherwise, no change is made to `current_profit`. `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their previous values, and a new variable `max_profit` is introduced, which is assigned the value of `current_profit`. The value of `max_profit` is equal to the current profit, which may have been decreased by the first element of `removed_item` if it exists.
