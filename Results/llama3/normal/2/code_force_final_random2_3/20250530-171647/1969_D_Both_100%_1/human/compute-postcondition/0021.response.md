Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `item` is the last tuple from `combined`, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0. The variable `_` is still equal to `k`. The values of `n` and `k` are still the return values of `func_2()`. The lists `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged. The current profit is still the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`. The heap still contains `k` tuples from `combined`. The list `remaining_items` is still empty. A new variable `item` is created and assigned the last tuple from `combined`. The list `combined` has been reduced by one tuple, but it is still a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`.
