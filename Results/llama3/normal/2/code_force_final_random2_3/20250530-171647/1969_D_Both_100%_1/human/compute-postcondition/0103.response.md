Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` has at least 1 element, `remaining_items` is empty, and `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. `current_profit` is increased by the value of the first element of the last element of `combined`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `current_profit`, which is updated by adding the value of the first element of the last element of `combined` to its previous value. This change is made regardless of the value of `removed_item`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
