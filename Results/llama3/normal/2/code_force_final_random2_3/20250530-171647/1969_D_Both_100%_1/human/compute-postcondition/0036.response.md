Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`, and `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of the last tuple that was removed from `combined`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `current_profit` has been decreased by the second element of the last tuple that was removed from `combined`. All other variables remain unchanged.
