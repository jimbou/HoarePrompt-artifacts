The `print(max_profit)` statement will print the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items with the given prices and bonuses.

Since the exact values of `prices` and `bonuses` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `max_profit`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated maximum profit.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items with the given prices and bonuses)**
