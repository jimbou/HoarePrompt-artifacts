Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, and has one less tuple than before, and is not empty, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined` and is the last tuple of the original `combined` list, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the first element of `removed_item` from it. The other variables remain unchanged. The code only affects the `current_profit` variable, decreasing its value by the first element of `removed_item`.
