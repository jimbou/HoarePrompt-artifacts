Postcondition: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `item` is the last tuple from `combined`, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple from `heap` or `item` if `item` is smaller than the smallest tuple in `heap`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before, and the current value of `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**
