Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `test_cases`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` is empty, `item` is undefined, `combined` is empty, `remaining_items` is empty, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items with the given prices and bonuses.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations specified by `test_cases`. The loop variables `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `heap`, `item`, `combined`, and `remaining_items` have been updated according to the loop body, and `max_profit` has been updated to be the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items with the given prices and bonuses. The state of other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
