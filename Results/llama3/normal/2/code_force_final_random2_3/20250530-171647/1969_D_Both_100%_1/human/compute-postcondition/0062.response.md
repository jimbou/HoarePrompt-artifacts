Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, if `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has one less item. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. `item` is undefined, `removed_item` is undefined, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0.***
