Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to k, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` with one less item, `heap` contains the k smallest tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last tuple from `combined` that was popped, and the current value of `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `max_profit` is either 0 or equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains 0, and `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting `item[1]` from it. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `max_profit` is still dependent on the value of `current_profit`, and its value is either 0 or equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than 0.
