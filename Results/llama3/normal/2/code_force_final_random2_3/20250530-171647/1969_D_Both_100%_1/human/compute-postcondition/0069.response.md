Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has `k` less items, `item` is undefined, `removed_item` is undefined, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `test_cases` remains greater than 0.
* The value of `_` is equal to `k`.
* The values of `n` and `k` are still the return values of `func_2()`.
* The lists `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged.
* The heap contains `k` tuples from the original `combined` list.
* The `remaining_items` list is still empty.
* The `combined` list has `k` less items than its original size.
* The variables `item` and `removed_item` are still undefined.
* The values of `current_profit` and `max_profit` remain 0.
