Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` is empty, `item` is undefined, `combined` is empty, `remaining_items` is empty, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items in the `combined` list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `combined` list is empty, the `heap` is empty, and the `max_profit` variable holds the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling items in the `combined` list. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
