Postcondition: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` has one less element. If `removed_item` is not empty, the current value of `current_profit` is decreased by the value of `removed_item[0]`, and the current value of `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. If `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, then the current value of `current_profit` is updated to be `current_profit - item[1]`, and the current value of `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit - item[1]` if `current_profit - item[1]` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, if `item[0] + item[1]` is less than 0, then the current value of `current_profit` is increased by the value of `item[0]`, and if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then the current value of `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains 0. The current value of `current_profit` is greater than the current value of `max_profit`.**
