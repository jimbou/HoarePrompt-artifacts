Postcondition: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to k, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` with at least three less items, `heap` contains the k smallest tuples from `combined` with the last tuple `item` from `combined` replaced by `removed_item`, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the second last tuple from `combined` that was popped, `removed_item` is the tuple that was removed from the heap and is equal to the smallest tuple in `heap` that is either `item` or the smallest tuple in `heap` before `item` was pushed, and `max_profit` is either 0 or equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than 0 and `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains 0. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`. If `removed_item` exists, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.**
