Output State: **test_cases is greater than 0, _ is equal to k plus 1, n and k are the return values of func_2(), prices is a list of values returned by func_2(), neg_prices is a list of negative values of prices, bonuses is a list of values returned by func_2(), heap is empty, remaining_items is empty, combined is a sorted list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, item is undefined, removed_item is undefined, current_profit is 0, max_profit is 0**

Explanation:

*   The initial state is preserved for `test_cases`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` as they are not modified by the code.
*   `heap` is reset to an empty list.
*   `remaining_items` is also reset to an empty list.
*   `combined` is created as a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple (i.e., the bonuses).
*   `item` and `removed_item` are undefined because no items have been removed from `combined` or `heap`.
*   `current_profit` is initialized to 0.
*   `max_profit` is initialized to 0.

Note that the code does not modify the values of `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, or `bonuses` because they are not assigned new values. The code only creates new lists and variables, and initializes them with specific values or emptiness.
