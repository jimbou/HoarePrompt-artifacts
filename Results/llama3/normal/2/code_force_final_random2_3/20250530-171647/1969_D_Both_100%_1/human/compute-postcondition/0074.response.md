Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` and has `k` less items, `item` is undefined, `removed_item` is undefined, `max_profit` is equal to the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is either the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` or 0.**

In this output state, the value of `max_profit` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `current_profit`, which is either the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, or 0 otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
