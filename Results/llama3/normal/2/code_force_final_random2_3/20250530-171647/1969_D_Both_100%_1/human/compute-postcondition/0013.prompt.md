Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is the return value of func_1() that must be greater than 0, _ is 0, heap is an empty list, remaining_items is an empty list, n and k are the return values of func_2(), prices is a list of values returned by func_2(), neg_prices is a list of negative values of prices, bonuses is a list of values returned by func_2(), max_profit is 0, current_profit is 0, combined is a sorted list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses, sorted by bonuses.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()` where `k` is at least 1, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before. Otherwise, `heap` and `remaining_items` remain empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()` where `k` is at least 1, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with two less tuples than before. Otherwise, `heap` and `remaining_items` remain empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()` where `k` is at least 3, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0. If `combined` is not empty, `heap` contains one tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `combined` is a sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by `bonuses`, with one less tuple than before. If `combined` is empty, `heap` and `remaining_items` remain empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
