Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to k, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` with one less item, `heap` contains the k smallest tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last tuple from `combined` that was popped, and `max_profit` is either 0 or equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains 0. Additionally, the sum of the elements in the last tuple `item` from `combined` is less than 0, and `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `current_profit` has been increased by the first element of the last tuple `item` from `combined`. The other variables remain unchanged.
