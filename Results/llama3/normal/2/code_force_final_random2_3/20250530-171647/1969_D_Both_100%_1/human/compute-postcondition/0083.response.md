Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `k`, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` contains `k` tuples from `combined`, `remaining_items` is empty, `removed_item` is the smallest tuple in `heap` before the push operation, `item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` has one less element. If `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is updated to be `current_profit - item[1]`, and `max_profit` is either 0 or `current_profit - item[1]` if `current_profit - item[1]` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, if `item[0] + item[1]` is less than 0, then `current_profit` is increased by the value of `item[0]`, and if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains 0.**

The code executes the `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` function, which pushes the `item` onto the heap and then pops and returns the smallest item from the heap. The heap still contains `k` tuples from `combined`, but the smallest tuple before the push operation is now removed and stored in the `removed_item` variable. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
