Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to k, `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` with one less item, `heap` contains the k smallest tuples from `combined` with the last tuple `item` from `combined` replaced by `removed_item`, `remaining_items` is empty, `item` is the last tuple from `combined` that was popped, `removed_item` is the tuple that was removed from the heap and exists, and `max_profit` is either 0 or equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains 0. `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their previous values except for `current_profit`, which is decreased by the value of `removed_item[0]`. This means that `current_profit` is now lower than its previous value by the amount of `removed_item[0]`. All other variables, including `test_cases`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `combined`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `item`, `removed_item`, and `max_profit`, remain unchanged.
