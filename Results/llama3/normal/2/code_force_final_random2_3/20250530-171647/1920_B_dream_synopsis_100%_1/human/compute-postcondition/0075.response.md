The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line updates the value of `sums` by adding the integer at index `i - 1` in list `a` to its current value. The second line appends the updated value of `sums` to the list `ans`.

Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to i, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums, i is incremented by 1, sums is the sum of all integers in a up to index i - 1**
