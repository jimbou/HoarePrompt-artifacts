Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to i, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums, i is incremented by 1, sums is the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the integer at index i + x - 1 plus the integer at index i - 1**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated to include the difference between the integer at index `i - 1` and twice the integer at index `i + x - 1` in the list `a`. The list `ans` now contains this updated value of `sums`. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
