Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) if i is 0. Otherwise, if the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, then `ans` is a list containing the sum of all integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]`.***
