Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums, i is incremented by 1, sums is the updated value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `sums` and `ans`. The first line updates the value of `sums` by adding the difference between `a[i - 1]` and twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The second line appends the updated value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1` remain unchanged.
