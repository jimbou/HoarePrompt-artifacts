Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than the current value of i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is increased by 1, sums is the updated value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])**.

In this output state, the value of `i` has been increased by 1. The value of `sums` has been updated to be the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`. The list `ans` now contains the updated value of `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
