Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i` + `x` - 1 is less than `n`, then `sums` is the updated value of `sums` + `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]`. If `i` + `x` - 1 is greater than or equal to `n`, then `sums` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`. `i` is increased by 1. If `i` + `x` - 1 is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is also increased by `a[i - 1]`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is not changed, but it is known to be greater than or equal to 0. The value of `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, which is the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` if `k` + `x` - 1 is greater than or equal to `n`, or the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` plus the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `k` + `x` - 1 elements of `a` if `k` + `x` - 1 is less than `n`. The value of `stdin` remains unchanged.
