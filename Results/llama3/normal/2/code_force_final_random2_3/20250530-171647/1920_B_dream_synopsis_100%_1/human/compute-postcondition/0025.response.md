The code prints the maximum value from the list `ans`, which contains the updated sums value after `k + 1` iterations. Since `k` is 0, `k + 1` equals 1. This means the list `ans` contains the sum of all integers in list `a` after 1 iteration. The sum of all integers in list `a` is stored in the variable `sum1`. Therefore, the maximum value in the list `ans` is the sum of all integers in list `a` after 1 iteration, which is equal to `sum1`.

Output: **sum1 (which is the sum of all integers in list a)**
