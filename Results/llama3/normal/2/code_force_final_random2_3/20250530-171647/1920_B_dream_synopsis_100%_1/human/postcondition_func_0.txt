This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of elements (t), an integer k, and an integer x. The second line contains t integers. The function sorts these integers in descending order, calculates a series of sums by subtracting twice the sum of the first x integers and adding the sum of the next k-1 integers, and stores these sums in a list. It then prints the maximum sum from this list. The function repeats this process for all test cases in the input.
