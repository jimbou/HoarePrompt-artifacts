Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums, i is equal to k, sums is the sum of all integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the first x integers in a plus the sum of the integers from index x to k-1 minus 2 times the sum of the integers from index 2*x-1 to k+x-2 if k+x-1 is less than n. Otherwise, sums is the sum of all integers in a plus the sum of the integers from index x to k-1 if k+x-1 is not less than n, and the maximum value in the ans list is printed, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the values of n, k, x, a, sum1, ans, i, and sums will be updated according to the loop body. The value of stdin will be reduced by 2 inputs for each iteration of the loop. The maximum value in the ans list will be printed after each iteration.
