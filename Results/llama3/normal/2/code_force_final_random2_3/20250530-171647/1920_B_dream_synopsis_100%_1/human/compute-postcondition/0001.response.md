Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**.

The first line assigns the integer values of the first two inputs from stdin to `n`, `k`, and `x`, respectively. The second line assigns a list of integers from the next input in stdin to `a`. The third line sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The fourth line reverses the sorted list `a`, making it in descending order. The fifth line assigns the sum of all integers in `a` to `sum1`. The sixth line initializes an empty list `ans`. The value of `_` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
