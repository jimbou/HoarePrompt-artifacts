Based on the precondition, the `ans` list contains the maximum value of `sums` calculated in each iteration. The value of `sums` is updated based on the conditions specified.

If `i` is 0, `ans` contains the value of `sum1` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`. This is because `sums` is initialized with the value of `sum1`, and then the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` is subtracted twice.

If `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. The value of `sums` is updated based on the conditions specified. If `i` + `x` - 1 is less than `n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting 2 times `a[i + x - 1]`. If `i` + `x` - 1 is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated by adding the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` and `a[i - 1]`.

The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value of `sums` calculated in each iteration.

Output: **The maximum value of sums (where sums is the maximum value of the sums calculated in each iteration)**
