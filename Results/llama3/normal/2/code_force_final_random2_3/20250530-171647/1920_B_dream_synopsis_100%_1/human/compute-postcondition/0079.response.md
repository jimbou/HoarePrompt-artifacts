The code prints the maximum value in the `ans` list, which contains the updated value of `sums`. The value of `sums` depends on the condition `k+x-1` being less than `n` or not.

If `k+x-1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus the sum of the integers from index `x` to `k-1` minus 2 times the sum of the integers from index `2*x-1` to `k+x-2`. This value is then added to the `ans` list.

If `k+x-1` is not less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of all integers in `a` plus the sum of the integers from index `x` to `k-1`. This value is then added to the `ans` list.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the integers in `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sums` or the maximum value in the `ans` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum value in the `ans` list, which represents the maximum updated value of `sums` based on the given conditions.

Output: **max(ans) (where max(ans) is the maximum value in the ans list, representing the maximum updated value of sums based on the given conditions)**
