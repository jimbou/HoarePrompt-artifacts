Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is an empty list, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

The code first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `x`, respectively. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, sorts them in descending order, and assigns the sorted list to `a`. The sum of all integers in `a` is calculated and assigned to `sum1`. Finally, an empty list `ans` is created. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. After the code executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
