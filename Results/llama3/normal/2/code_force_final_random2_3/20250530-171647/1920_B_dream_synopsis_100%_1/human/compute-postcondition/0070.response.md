Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of sums, `i` is incremented by 1. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `sums` is the updated value of sums + `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is the sum of all integers in `a` up to index `i-1`.***
