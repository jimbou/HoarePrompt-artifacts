Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

The code first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to n, k, and x, respectively. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, sorts them in descending order, and assigns the sorted list to a. The sum of all integers in a is calculated and assigned to sum1. Finally, an empty list is assigned to ans. The value of _ remains unchanged at 0. After the execution of the code, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
