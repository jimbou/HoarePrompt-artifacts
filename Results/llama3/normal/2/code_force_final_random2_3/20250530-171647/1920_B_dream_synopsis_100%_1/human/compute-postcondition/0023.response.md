Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is at least the current value of i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the updated value based on the new value of i and x, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is increased by 1, and sums is updated accordingly based on the new value of i and x. If i is 0, then sums is the sum of all integers in a minus twice the sum of the first x integers in a, and ans contains the updated sums value. Otherwise, if i + x - 1 is less than n, then sums is increased by a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] and ans contains the updated value of sums. Otherwise, sums is increased by a[i - 1] and ans contains the updated sums value.***
