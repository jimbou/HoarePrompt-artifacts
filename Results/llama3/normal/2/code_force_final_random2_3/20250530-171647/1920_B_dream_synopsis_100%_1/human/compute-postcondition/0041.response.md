Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than the current value of i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If i is 0, ans is a list containing the value of sum1 minus 2 times the sum of the first x integers in a. If i is not equal to 0, ans is a list containing the value of sums. If i + x - 1 is less than n, then sums is the updated value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]. If i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, then sums is the sum of the first i elements of a. i is increased by 1.**

The code block modifies the values of `sums` and `ans`. The first line updates the value of `sums` by adding the difference between the element at index `i - 1` in list `a` and twice the element at index `i + x - 1` in list `a`. The second line appends the updated value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `_` remain unchanged. The number of inputs in `stdin` is reduced by 2.
