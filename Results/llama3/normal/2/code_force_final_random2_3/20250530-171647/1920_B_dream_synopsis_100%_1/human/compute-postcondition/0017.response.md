Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i` is 0, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the value `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the sum of `sums` and `a[i - 1]`, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is increased by 1, and `sums` is updated accordingly based on the value of `i` and `x`.**
