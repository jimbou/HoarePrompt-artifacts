Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers t, k, and x (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ k,x ≤ t). The second line contains t integers a_1, a_2,...,a_t (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    a.reverse()
    sum1 = sum(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k + 1):
        if i == 0:
            sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
            ans.append(sums)
        elif i + x - 1 < n:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
        else:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
    print(max(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the updated sums value after k + 1 iterations, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the maximum value in the list ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i` + `x` - 1 is less than `n`, then `sums` is the updated value of `sums` + `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]`. If `i` + `x` - 1 is greater than or equal to `n`, then `sums` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`. `i` is increased by 1. If `i` + `x` - 1 is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is also increased by `a[i - 1]`, and the maximum value in the `ans` list is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of sums, `i` is equal to `k`, `sums` is the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus the sum of the integers from index `x` to `k-1` minus 2 times the sum of the integers from index `2*x-1` to `k+x-2` if `k+x-1` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `sums` is the sum of all integers in `a` plus the sum of the integers from index `x` to `k-1` if `k+x-1` is not less than `n`, and the maximum value in the `ans` list is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
