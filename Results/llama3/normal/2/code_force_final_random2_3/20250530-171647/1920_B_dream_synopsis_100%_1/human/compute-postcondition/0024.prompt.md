Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) if `i` is 0, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the value sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 < n, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the sum of sums and a[i - 1], _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i` is 0, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the value `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the sum of `sums` and `a[i - 1]`, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is increased by 1, and `sums` is updated accordingly based on the value of `i` and `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, k is at least the current value of i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the updated value based on the new value of i and x, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is increased by 1, and sums is updated accordingly based on the new value of i and x. If i is 0, then sums is the sum of all integers in a minus twice the sum of the first x integers in a, and ans contains the updated sums value. Otherwise, if i + x - 1 is less than n, then sums is increased by a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] and ans contains the updated value of sums. Otherwise, sums is increased by a[i - 1] and ans contains the updated sums value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
