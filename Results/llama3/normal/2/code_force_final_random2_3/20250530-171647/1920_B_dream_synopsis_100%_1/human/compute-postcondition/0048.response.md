Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If i is 0, ans is a list containing the value of sum1 minus 2 times the sum of the first x integers in a. If i is not equal to 0, ans is a list containing the value of sums. If i + x - 1 is less than n, then sums is the updated value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]. If i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, then sums is the sum of the first i elements of a. i is increased by 1. If i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, sums is also increased by a[i - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains the value of `sum1` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. The value of `i` has been increased by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
