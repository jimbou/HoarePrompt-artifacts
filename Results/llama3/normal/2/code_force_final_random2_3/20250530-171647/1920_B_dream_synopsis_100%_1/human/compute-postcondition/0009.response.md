The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line adds the value of `a[i - 1]` to `sums`, and the second line appends the updated value of `sums` to `ans`. 

Since `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `a[i - 1]` is an integer. The value of `sums` is not specified in the initial state, so we will assume it is an integer as well. The value of `i` is not equal to 0, so `i - 1` is a valid index for the list `a`. 

After the first line executes, `sums` becomes the sum of its original value and `a[i - 1]`. Since `a[i - 1]` is an integer, `sums` remains an integer. 

After the second line executes, `ans` becomes a list containing the updated value of `sums`. Since `ans` was initially an empty list, it now contains one element, which is the updated value of `sums`. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. 

Output State: **n is an integer, k is at least 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the sum of sums and a[i - 1], _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is not equal to 0, and i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n**
