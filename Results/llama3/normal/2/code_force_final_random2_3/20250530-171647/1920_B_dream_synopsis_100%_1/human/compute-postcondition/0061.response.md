Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums, _ is 0, i is not equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The current value of i + x - 1 is less than n, sums is the updated value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. This updated value of `sums` has been appended to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `_`, and `i`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
