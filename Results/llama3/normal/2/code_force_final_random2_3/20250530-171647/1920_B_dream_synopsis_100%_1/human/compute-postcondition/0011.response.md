Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) if `i` is 0, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the value sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 < n, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the sum of sums and a[i - 1], _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs***
