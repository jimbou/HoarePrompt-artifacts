According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `k` is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0**
