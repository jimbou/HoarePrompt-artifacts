Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to `i`, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of sums, `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0, then `sums` is the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`. If `i` is not 0, then if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x - 1` plus the integer at index `i - 1`. Otherwise, `sums` is the sum of all integers in `a` up to index `i - 1`.***
