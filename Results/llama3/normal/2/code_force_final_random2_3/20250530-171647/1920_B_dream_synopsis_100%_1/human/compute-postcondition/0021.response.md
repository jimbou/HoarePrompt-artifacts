Output State: **n is an integer, k is at least the current value of i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the updated value based on the new value of i and x, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is increased by 1, and sums is updated accordingly based on the new value of i and x, sums is increased by a[i - 1], ans contains the updated sums value.**

The code block modifies the values of `sums` and `ans`. The first line adds the value of `a[i - 1]` to `sums`, increasing its value. The second line appends the updated value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
