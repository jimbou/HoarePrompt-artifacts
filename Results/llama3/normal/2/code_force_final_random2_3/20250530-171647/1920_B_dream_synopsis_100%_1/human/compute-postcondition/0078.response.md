Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of sums, `i` is equal to `k`, `sums` is the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus the sum of the integers from index `x` to `k-1` minus 2 times the sum of the integers from index `2*x-1` to `k+x-2` if `k+x-1` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `sums` is the sum of all integers in `a` plus the sum of the integers from index `x` to `k-1` if `k+x-1` is not less than `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ans` will contain the updated value of `sums` after `k+1` iterations. The value of `sums` depends on whether `k+x-1` is less than `n` or not. If it is, then `sums` will be the sum of all integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` integers in `a` plus the sum of the integers from index `x` to `k-1` minus 2 times the sum of the integers from index `2*x-1` to `k+x-2`. If `k+x-1` is not less than `n`, then `sums` will be the sum of all integers in `a` plus the sum of the integers from index `x` to `k-1`. The value of `i` will be equal to `k` after the loop finishes executing.
