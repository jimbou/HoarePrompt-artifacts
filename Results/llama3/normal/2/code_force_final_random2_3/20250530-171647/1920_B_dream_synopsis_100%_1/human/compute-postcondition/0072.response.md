The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 so `i` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than or equal to `i`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to `i`, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all integers in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of sums, `i` is incremented by 1**
