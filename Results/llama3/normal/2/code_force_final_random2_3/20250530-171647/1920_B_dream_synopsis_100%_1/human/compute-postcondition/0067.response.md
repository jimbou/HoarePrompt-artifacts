Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of all integers in a, ans is a list containing the updated value sums which is the sum of all integers in a minus twice the sum of the first x integers in a, i is incremented by 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `sum1` also remains the same as it is not updated by the code. The value of `ans` is updated by appending the value of `sums`, which is calculated as the sum of all integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in `a`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
