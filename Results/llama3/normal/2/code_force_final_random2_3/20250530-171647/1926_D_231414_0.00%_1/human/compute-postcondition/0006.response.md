Output State: **times is at least 1, check is 2147483647, stdin contains multiple test cases with one input: n space-separated integers, n is an integer, data is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, dic is a dictionary that contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the first integer in the list and `check`, ans is an integer equal to n-1, i is the first integer in the list, and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between i and check is in dic with a count reduced by 1.**

In this final state, all variables retain their initial values except for `ans` and the count of the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `i` and `check` in dictionary `dic`. The value of `ans` is decremented by 1, making it `n-1`, and the count of the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `i` and `check` in `dic` is reduced by 1.
