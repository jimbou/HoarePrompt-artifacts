Postcondition: **times is at least 1, check is 2147483647, stdin contains multiple test cases with one input: n space-separated integers, n is an integer, data is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, dic is a dictionary that contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the first integer in the list and `check`, ans is an integer equal to n-1, i is the first integer in the list, and the result of the bitwise XOR operation between i and check is in dic with a count reduced by 1. The current value of dic[s] is 0.**
