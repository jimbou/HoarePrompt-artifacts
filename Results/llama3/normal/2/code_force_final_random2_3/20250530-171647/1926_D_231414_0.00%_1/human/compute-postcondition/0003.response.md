The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `data`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `data`. If data has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, times is at least 1, check is 2147483647, stdin contains multiple test cases with one input: n space-separated integers, n is an integer, dic is an empty dictionary, ans is an integer equal to n. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the i is the first integer in the list.
State: **`times` is at least 1, `check` is 2147483647, stdin contains multiple test cases with one input: n space-separated integers, n is an integer, data is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, dic is an empty dictionary, ans is an integer equal to n, i is the first integer in the list**
