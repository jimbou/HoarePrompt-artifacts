To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `times`. The loop will execute if `times` is at least 1.

State: **`times` is at least 1, `check` is 2147483647, stdin contains multiple test cases with one input: n space-separated integers**
