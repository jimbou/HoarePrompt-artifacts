Output State: **times is an integer, check is 2147483647, stdin contains multiple test cases with one input: n space-separated integers**.

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `times`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs, after reading the first input, stdin will still contain multiple test cases with one input: `n` space-separated integers. The second line assigns the value of `2 ** 31 - 1` to `check`, which is equal to 2147483647. No other variables are affected.
