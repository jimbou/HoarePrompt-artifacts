Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. It then processes the second line of each test case, which contains a list of integers, and prints the sum of the count of each unique integer divided by 3. The function effectively calculates and outputs the total number of sets of three identical integers that can be formed from the given lists of integers.**
