Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) â€” the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
    elements = line.split()
    print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `elements` is a list of strings split from the 3rd line, stdin contains multiple test cases, `open(0)` has at least 3 lines, `line` is the 3rd line, and the sum of the count of each unique item in the list `elements` divided by 3 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `elements` is a list of strings split from the 5th line, stdin contains multiple test cases, `open(0)` has at least 5 lines, `line` is the 5th line, and the sum of the count of each unique item in the list `elements` divided by 3 is being printed, and `elements` is reassigned to the split of the 5th line, and the sum of the count of each unique item in the list `elements` divided by 3 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `elements` is a list of strings split from the 7th line, stdin contains multiple test cases, `open(0)` has at least 7 lines, `line` is the 7th line, and the sum of the count of each unique item in the list `elements` divided by 3 is being printed, and `elements` is reassigned to the split of the 7th line, and the sum of the count of each unique item in the list `elements` divided by 3 is being printed, and the sum of the count of each unique item in the list `elements` divided by 3 is being printed, which is the sum of the count of each unique item in the list `elements` divided by 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
