The code prints the sum of the count of each unique item in the `elements` list divided by 3. The `elements` list is created by splitting the 3rd line from the standard input (`stdin`). The `*` operator is used to unpack the `elements` list into a set, which removes duplicates. The `count` method is then used to count the occurrences of each unique item in the `elements` list. The `//` operator is used for integer division, which discards the remainder and returns the quotient. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of these quotients.

Output: **the sum of the count of each unique item in the elements list divided by 3**
