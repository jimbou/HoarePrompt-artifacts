The code prints the sum of the count of each unique item in the list `elements` divided by 3. Here, `elements` is a list of strings split from the 5th line of the input. The `*` operator is used to unpack the list into a set, which removes duplicates. The `count` method is then used to count the occurrences of each unique item in the list. The `//` operator is used for integer division, which discards the remainder and returns the quotient. The `sum` function is used to calculate the total sum of these counts divided by 3.

Output: **the sum of the count of each unique item in the list elements divided by 3**
