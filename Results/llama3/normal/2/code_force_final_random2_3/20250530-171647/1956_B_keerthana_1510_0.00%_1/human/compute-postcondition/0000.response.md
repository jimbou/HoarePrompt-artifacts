The only objects in the loop head are variable `line` and the file object `open(0)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object `open(0)`. If the file object `open(0)` has at least 3 lines the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the file object `open(0)` must have at least 3 lines and the line is the 3rd line.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, `open(0)` has at least 3 lines, `line` is the 3rd line**
