Output State: **`a` is a list containing two string inputs, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `_` is 2, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0, `y` is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a`, `i` is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` still contains two string inputs, the integer `n` is still greater than 1, there are still multiple test cases minus four in the standard input, the variable `_` remains 2, the list `s` is still empty, the variables `x` and `i` are still 0, and the variable `y` is now equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a`, which is the same as the current value of `i`.
