According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the number 2. If `_` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, 2 is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again 2 must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is a list containing two string inputs, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 2, 2 is greater than 2**
