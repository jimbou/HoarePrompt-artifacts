This function reads two binary strings of the same length from standard input, combines them into a new string by replacing a prefix of the first string with a suffix of the second string, and prints the combined string along with the length of the longest suffix of the second string that matches a prefix of the combined string. If no such suffix is found, it prints 1. The function processes multiple test cases from standard input.
