Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two string inputs, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, _ is 2, s is a string that is a combination of the first i + 1 characters of the first string in a and the rest of the second string in a if a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', otherwise s is an empty list, x is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', otherwise x is 0, y is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', otherwise y is not changed, i is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', otherwise i is not changed, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.***
