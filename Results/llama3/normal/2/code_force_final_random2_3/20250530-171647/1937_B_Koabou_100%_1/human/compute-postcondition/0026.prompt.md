Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list containing two string inputs, n is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, _ is 2, s is an empty list, x is 0, y is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
        y = i
    if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
        s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
        x = i
        break
else:
    s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
    x = n - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *a is a list containing two string inputs, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, _ is 2, s is a string that is a combination of the first i + 1 characters of the first string in a and the rest of the second string in a if a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', otherwise s is an empty list, x is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', otherwise x is 0, y is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', otherwise y is not changed, i is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', otherwise i is not changed, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is a list containing two string inputs, n is an integer that must be greater than i + 1, _ is 2. If a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', then s is a string that is a combination of the first i + 1 characters of the first string in a and the rest of the second string in a, x, y, and i are equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases. Otherwise, s is a string that is a combination of the first i + 2 characters of the first string in a and the rest of the second string in a if a[0][i + 2] is '1' and a[1][i + 1] is '0', otherwise s is an empty list, x is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 2] is '1' and a[1][i + 1] is '0', otherwise x is 0, y is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 2] is '1' and a[1][i + 1] is '0', otherwise y is 0, i is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 2] is '1' and a[1][i + 1] is '0', otherwise i is not changed, and stdin contains multiple test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is a list containing two string inputs, n is an integer that must be greater than i + 2, _ is 2. If a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', then s is a string that is a combination of the first i + 1 characters of the first string in a and the rest of the second string in a, x is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a, y is equal to i, and i is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases. Otherwise, s is a string that is a combination of the first i + 2 characters of the first string in a and the rest of the second string in a if a[0][i + 2] is '1' and a[1][i + 1] is '0', otherwise s is an empty list, x is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 2] is '1' and a[1][i + 1] is '0', otherwise x is 0, y is equal to i, i is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 2] is '1' and a[1][i + 1] is '0', otherwise i is not changed, and stdin contains multiple test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
