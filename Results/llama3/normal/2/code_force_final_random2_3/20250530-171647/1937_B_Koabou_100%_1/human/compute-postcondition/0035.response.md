The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, y and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `y` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `y` + 1, `y` is less than `x`, `x` is `n` - 1 or the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`a` is a list containing two string inputs, `n` is an integer, `_` is 2, `s` is a string that is a combination of the first i + 1 characters of the first string in `a` and the rest of the second string in `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `s` is a string that is a combination of the first string in `a` and the last character of the second string in `a`, `x` is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `x` is `n` - 1, `y` is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `y` is not changed and is less than `x`, `i` is `y` + 2, `t` is `x` - `i` + 1 if `a[1][i:x]` is equal to `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, otherwise `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases if `a[1][i:x]` is not equal to `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, otherwise stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases. If `a[1][i:x]` is equal to `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `t` is `x` - `i` + 1, otherwise `t` is 1.**
