Output State: **`a` is a list containing two string inputs, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `_` is 2, 2 is not greater than 2**

The loop executes two times, appending two string inputs to the list `a`. After the loop finishes, the value of `_` is 2, and the condition `2 is greater than 2` is no longer true, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The state of `n` and the remaining test cases in stdin remains unchanged.
