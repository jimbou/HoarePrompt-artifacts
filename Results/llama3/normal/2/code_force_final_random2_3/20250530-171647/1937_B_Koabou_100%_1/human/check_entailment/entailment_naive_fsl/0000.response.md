Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

3
2
11
00

The program outputs:

110
1

However, the correct output should be:

000
2

The program fails to consider the case where the first row has a '1' and the second row has a '0' in the same column. In this case, the lexicographically smallest string should be '000', not '110'. Additionally, there are two paths that yield this string, not one.

The program's logic is flawed, and it does not correctly handle all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
