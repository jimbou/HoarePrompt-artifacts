Output State: **`a` is a list containing two string inputs, `n` is an integer, `_` is 2, `s` is a string that is a combination of the first i + 1 characters of the first string in `a` and the rest of the second string in `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `s` is a string that is a combination of the first string in `a` and the last character of the second string in `a`, `x` is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `x` is `n` - 1, `y` is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `y` is not changed, `i` is `n` - 2, `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `t` which is assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
