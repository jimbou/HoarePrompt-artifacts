Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list containing two string inputs, `n` is an integer, `_` is 2, `s` is a string that is a combination of the first i + 1 characters of the first string in `a` and the rest of the second string in `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `s` is a string that is a combination of the first string in `a` and the last character of the second string in `a`, `x` is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `x` is `n` - 1, `y` is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `y` is not changed, `i` is `n` - 2, `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(y, x):
    if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
        t = x - i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list containing two string inputs, `n` is an integer, `_` is 2, `s` is a string that is a combination of the first i + 1 characters of the first string in `a` and the rest of the second string in `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `s` is a string that is a combination of the first string in `a` and the last character of the second string in `a`, `x` is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `x` is `n` - 1, `y` is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `y` is not changed and is less than `x`, `i` is `y`, `t` is `x` - `i` + 1 if `a[1][i:x]` is equal to `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, otherwise `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases if `a[1][i:x]` is not equal to `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, otherwise stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list containing two string inputs, `n` is an integer, `_` is 2, `s` is a string that is a combination of the first i + 1 characters of the first string in `a` and the rest of the second string in `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `s` is a string that is a combination of the first string in `a` and the last character of the second string in `a`, `x` is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `x` is `n` - 1, `y` is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1' for any `i` in range(`n` - 1), otherwise `y` is not changed and is less than `x`, `i` is `y` + 1, `t` is `x` - `i` + 1 if `a[1][i:x]` is equal to `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, otherwise `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases if `a[1][i:x]` is not equal to `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, otherwise stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases. If `a[1][i:x]` is equal to `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `t` is `x` - `i` + 1, otherwise `t` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *a is a list containing two string inputs, n is an integer, _ is 2, s is a string that is a combination of the first i + 1 characters of the first string in a and the rest of the second string in a if a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0' for any i in range(n - 1), otherwise s is a string that is a combination of the first string in a and the last character of the second string in a, x is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0' for any i in range(n - 1), otherwise x is n - 1, y is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 1] is '0' and a[1][i] is '1' for any i in range(n - 1), otherwise y is not changed and is less than x, i is y + 2, t is x - i + 1 if a[1][i:x] is equal to s[i + 1:x + 1], otherwise t is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases if a[1][i:x] is not equal to s[i + 1:x + 1], otherwise stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases. If a[1][i:x] is equal to s[i + 1:x + 1], then t is x - i + 1, otherwise t is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
