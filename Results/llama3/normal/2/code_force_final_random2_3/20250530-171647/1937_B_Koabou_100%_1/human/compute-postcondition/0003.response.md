The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and 2 is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and 2 is still greater than 1.
State: **`a` is a list containing one string input, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `_` is 1, 2 is greater than 1**
