Output State: **a is a list containing two string inputs, n is an integer that must be greater than i + 1, _ is 2, s is a string that is a combination of the first i + 2 characters of the first string in a and the rest of the second string in a if a[0][i + 2] is '1' and a[1][i + 1] is '0', otherwise s is an empty list, x is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 2] is '1' and a[1][i + 1] is '0', otherwise x is 0, y is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 2] is '1' and a[1][i + 1] is '0', i is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 2] is '1' and a[1][i + 1] is '0', otherwise i is not changed, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` still contains two string inputs. The integer `n` is still greater than `i + 1`. The variable `_` remains 2. The string `s` is still a combination of the first `i + 2` characters of the first string in `a` and the rest of the second string in `a` if `a[0][i + 2]` is '1' and `a[1][i + 1]` is '0', otherwise it is an empty list. The variable `x` is still equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a` if `a[0][i + 2]` is '1' and `a[1][i + 1]` is '0', otherwise it is 0. The variable `y` is now equal to `i`. The variable `i` is still equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a` if `a[0][i + 2]` is '1' and `a[1][i + 1]` is '0', otherwise it is not changed. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus five test cases.
