Output State: **`a` is a list containing one string input, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `_` is 0, 2 is greater than 0**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains one string input from the stdin, which was initially empty. The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, since one test case was consumed by the `input()` function. The value of `_` is still 0, and 2 is still greater than 0.
