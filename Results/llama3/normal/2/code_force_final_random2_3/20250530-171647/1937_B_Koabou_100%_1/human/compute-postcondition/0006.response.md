Output State: **`a` is a list containing three string inputs, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `_` is 2, 2 is greater than 2**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains three string inputs because it initially contained two string inputs and one more string input was appended to it. The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus four test cases because one more test case was consumed by the `input()` function. The value of `_` remains 2, and the condition 2 is greater than 2 is still valid.
