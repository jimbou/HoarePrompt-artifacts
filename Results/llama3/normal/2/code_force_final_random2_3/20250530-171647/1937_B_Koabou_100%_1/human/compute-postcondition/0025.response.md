Postcondition: **a is a list containing two string inputs, n is an integer that must be greater than i + 2, _ is 2. If a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', then s is a string that is a combination of the first i + 1 characters of the first string in a and the rest of the second string in a, x is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a, y is equal to i, and i is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases. Otherwise, s is a string that is a combination of the first i + 2 characters of the first string in a and the rest of the second string in a if a[0][i + 2] is '1' and a[1][i + 1] is '0', otherwise s is an empty list, x is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 2] is '1' and a[1][i + 1] is '0', otherwise x is 0, y is equal to i, i is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a if a[0][i + 2] is '1' and a[1][i + 1] is '0', otherwise i is not changed, and stdin contains multiple test cases.**
