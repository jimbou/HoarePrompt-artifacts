Output State: **`a` is a list containing two string inputs, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, `_` is 1, 2 is greater than 1**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains two string inputs because the code `a.append(input())` adds another string input to the list. The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three test cases because one more test case has been consumed by the `input()` function. The values of `_` and the relationship between 2 and 1 remain unchanged.
