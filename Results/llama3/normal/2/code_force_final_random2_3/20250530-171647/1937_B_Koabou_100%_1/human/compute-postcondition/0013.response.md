Postcondition: **a is a list containing two string inputs, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, _ is 2, s is an empty list, x is 0, if a[0][i + 1] is '0' and a[1][i] is '1', then y is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a and i is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a. Otherwise, no changes are made to y and i. The current value of a[0][i + 1] is '1' and the current value of a[1][i] is '0'.**
