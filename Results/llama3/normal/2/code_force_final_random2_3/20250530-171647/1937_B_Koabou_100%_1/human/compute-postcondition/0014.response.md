Output State: **a is a list containing two string inputs, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, _ is 2, s is a string that is a combination of the first i + 1 characters of the first string in a and the rest of the second string in a, x is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a, y is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a, i is equal to the index of the character '1' in the second string of a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to a combination of the first `i + 1` characters of the first string in `a` and the rest of the second string in `a`. The value of `x` has been updated to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a`. The values of `y` and `i` have also been updated to the index of the character '1' in the second string of `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
