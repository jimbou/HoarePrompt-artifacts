Output State: **stdin is empty, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, s2 is a string consisting of the same characters as s but in a random order. If s is not equal to s2, 'Yes' is printed along with s2. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the input buffer (stdin) will be empty because all the input strings have been processed. The variables s and s2 will still hold the last string and its shuffled version, respectively. The output will be either 'Yes' followed by the shuffled string s2 if s and s2 are not equal, or just 'No' if they are equal.
