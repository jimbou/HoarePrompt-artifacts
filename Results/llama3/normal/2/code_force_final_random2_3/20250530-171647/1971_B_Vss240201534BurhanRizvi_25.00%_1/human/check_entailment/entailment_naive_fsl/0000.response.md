Correctness: **False**.

The program does not guarantee that the rearranged string `s2` will be different from the original string `s`. In the worst-case scenario, the `random.sample` function might return the same permutation of characters as the original string, resulting in `s` being equal to `s2`. This would cause the program to incorrectly output "No" when a valid rearrangement exists.

For example, if the input is "abc", the program might generate a random permutation that is the same as the original string, resulting in `s` being equal to `s2`. In this case, the program would incorrectly output "No" instead of finding a valid rearrangement, such as "bac".
