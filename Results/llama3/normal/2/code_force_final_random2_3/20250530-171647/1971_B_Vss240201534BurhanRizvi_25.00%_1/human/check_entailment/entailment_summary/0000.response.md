Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It reads a series of strings from standard input, generates a random permutation of each string, and prints 'Yes' along with the permuted string if it is different from the original, or 'No' otherwise. This is in line with the problem description, which asks to rearrange the characters of a given string to form a new string that is not equal to the original, or report that it's impossible.

The program uses the `random.sample` function to generate a random permutation of each string, which is a valid approach to solve this problem. The program also correctly handles the case where the permuted string is the same as the original string, in which case it prints 'No'.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing multiple strings as specified by an initial integer input and emptying the standard input buffer in the process.

Correctness: **True**
