The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `stdin`. If `_` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is t-1, `stdin` contains t-1 strings. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is t and for the loop to execute again `stdin` must contain t strings.
State: **`stdin` contains t strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, s2 is a string consisting of the same characters as s but in a random order. If s is not equal to s2, 'Yes' is printed along with s2. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
