Functionality: **This function reads a series of strings from standard input, generates a random permutation of each string, and prints 'Yes' along with the permuted string if it is different from the original, or 'No' otherwise. The function processes multiple strings as specified by an initial integer input, and it empties the standard input buffer in the process.**
