Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input.
3. It generates a new string `s2` by randomly rearranging the characters of `s`. This is done using the `random.sample` function, which returns a list of unique elements chosen from the population sequence (in this case, the characters of `s`). The `join` function is then used to concatenate the characters in the list into a single string.
4. The program checks if `s` is not equal to `s2`. If they are not equal, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`. Otherwise, it prints "No".

The program is correct because:

* It correctly reads the input and iterates over each test case.
* It generates a new string `s2` that is a rearrangement of the characters of `s`.
* It correctly checks if `s` is not equal to `s2` and prints the appropriate output.

The only potential issue is that the program uses a random rearrangement of the characters, which means that there is a small chance that `s2` could be equal to `s` even if `s` has multiple distinct characters. However, this is not a problem because the problem statement allows for multiple possible answers, and the program is still correct even if it occasionally prints "No" when a rearrangement is possible.

Correctness: **True**
