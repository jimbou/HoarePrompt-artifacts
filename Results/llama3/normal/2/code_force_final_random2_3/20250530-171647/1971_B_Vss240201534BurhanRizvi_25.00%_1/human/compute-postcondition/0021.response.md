Output State: **stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, s2 is a string consisting of the same characters as s but in a random order. If s is not equal to s2, 'Yes' is printed along with s2. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to the first string from `stdin`, which has been removed from `stdin`. The value of `s2` has been updated to a random permutation of the characters in `s`. If `s` is not equal to `s2`, the program prints 'Yes' followed by the value of `s2`. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The value of `t` is not affected by the code and remains the same.
