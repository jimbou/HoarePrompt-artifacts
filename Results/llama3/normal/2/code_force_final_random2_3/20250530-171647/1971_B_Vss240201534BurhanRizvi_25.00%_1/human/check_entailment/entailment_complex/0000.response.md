Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the number of test cases and the strings for each test case. It then generates a random permutation of each string and checks if it is different from the original string. If it is different, it prints 'Yes' along with the permuted string. If it is not different (which means all characters in the string are the same), it prints 'No'.

The program correctly handles the case where all characters in the string are the same, in which case it is impossible to rearrange the characters to form a different string.

The use of the `random.sample` function to generate a random permutation of the string is also correct, as it ensures that all characters in the original string are present in the permuted string.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
