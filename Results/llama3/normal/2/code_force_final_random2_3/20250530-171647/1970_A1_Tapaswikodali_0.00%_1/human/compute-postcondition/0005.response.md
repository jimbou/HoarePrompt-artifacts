Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 1 character, `balance` is -1, `details` is an empty list, `index` is 0, `char` is the first character in the string `s`, and `char` is not equal to '('**

The code decreases the value of `balance` by 1. Since the initial value of `balance` is 0, the new value of `balance` is -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
