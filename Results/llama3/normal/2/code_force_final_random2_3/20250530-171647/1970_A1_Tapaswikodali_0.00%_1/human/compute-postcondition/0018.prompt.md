Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, balance is 0, details is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i, char in enumerate(s):
    if char == '(':
        balance += 1
    else:
        balance -= 1
    details.append((balance, -i, char))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 1 character, `index` is 0, `details` is a list containing one tuple: the first element of the tuple is 1 if the first character in the string `s` is an open parenthesis "(" and -1 otherwise, the second element of the tuple is 0, and the third element of the tuple is the first character of the string `s`, stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 2 characters, `index` is 1, `details` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is the same as before (1 if the first character in the string `s` is an open parenthesis "(" and -1 otherwise, 0, and the first character of the string `s`), the second tuple contains the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character, stdin is empty. If the character is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is 1. Otherwise, `balance` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 2 characters, `i` is 2, `char` is the second character in `s`, `details` is a list containing three tuples where the first two tuples are the same as before and the third tuple contains the current balance, the negative of the current index `i`, and the current character `char`, `stdin` is empty. If `char` is '(', then the balance in the third tuple is increased by 1. If `char` is ')', then the balance in the third tuple is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
