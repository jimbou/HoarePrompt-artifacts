#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `i` is the length of `s` minus 1, `char` is the last character in `s`, `details` is a list containing tuples where each tuple contains the balance, the negative of the index, and the character at that index, `stdin` is empty.
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: a string containing the characters from s in the order determined by the sorted details list, where the order is based on the balance and index of each character in s

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a balanced parentheses sequence from standard input, sorts the characters based on their balance and index, and prints the sorted characters in a string. The input string is expected to be non-empty, consist only of "(" and ")" characters, and have a length not exceeding 500,000. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the sorted string to the standard output.
