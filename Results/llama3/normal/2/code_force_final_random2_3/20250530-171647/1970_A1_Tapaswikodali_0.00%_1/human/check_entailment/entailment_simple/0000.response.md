Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly calculates the balance of each prefix of the input sequence and stores it along with the position and character in the `details` list.
2. The program sorts the `details` list based on the balance and position, which is correct according to the problem description.
3. The program extracts the characters from the sorted `details` list and joins them into a string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The use of the `enumerate` function to iterate over the input string and the `sort` method to sort the `details` list are also correct.

The program assumes that the input is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, which is guaranteed by the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
