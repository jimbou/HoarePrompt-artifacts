Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 1 character, `index` is 0, `details` is a list containing one tuple: the first element of the tuple is 1 if the first character in the string `s` is an open parenthesis "(" and -1 otherwise, the second element of the tuple is 0, and the third element of the tuple is the first character of the string `s`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the details list now contains a tuple with the balance, index, and character of the first parenthesis in the string `s`. The balance is either 1 or -1 depending on whether the first character is an open or close parenthesis, the index is 0, and the character is the first character of the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
