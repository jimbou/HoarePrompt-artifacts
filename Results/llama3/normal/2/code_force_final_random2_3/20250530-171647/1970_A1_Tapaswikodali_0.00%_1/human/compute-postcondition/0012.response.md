Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 2 characters, `index` is 1, `details` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is the same as before (1 if the first character in the string `s` is an open parenthesis "(" and -1 otherwise, 0, and the first character of the string `s`), the second tuple contains the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character, stdin is empty. If the character is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is 1. Otherwise, `balance` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the `details` list now contains a second tuple that reflects the current state of the parentheses sequence. The first element of this tuple is the current balance, which is either 1 (if the current character is an open parenthesis) or decreased by 1 (if the current character is a close parenthesis). The second element is the negative of the current index, which is -1. The third element is the current character, which is either "(" or ")". The other variables remain unchanged.
