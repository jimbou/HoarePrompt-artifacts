Functionality: **The function reads a balanced parentheses sequence from standard input, sorts the characters based on their balance and index, and prints the sorted characters in a string. The input string is expected to be non-empty, consist only of "(" and ")" characters, and have a length not exceeding 500,000. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the sorted string to the standard output.**
