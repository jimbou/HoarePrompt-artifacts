Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 2 characters, `i` is 2, `char` is the second character in `s`, `details` is a list containing three tuples where the first two tuples are the same as before and the third tuple contains the current balance, the negative of the current index `i`, and the current character `char`, `stdin` is empty. If `char` is '(', then the balance in the third tuple is increased by 1. If `char` is ')', then the balance in the third tuple is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the `details` list has been updated with a new tuple containing the current balance, the negative of the current index `i`, and the current character `char`. The balance in the third tuple is either increased by 1 if `char` is '(', or decreased by 1 if `char` is ')'. The other variables remain unchanged.
