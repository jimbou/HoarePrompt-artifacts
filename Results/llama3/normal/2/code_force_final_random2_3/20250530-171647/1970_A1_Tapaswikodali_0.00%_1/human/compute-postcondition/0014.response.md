Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 2 characters, `i` is 2, `char` is the second character in `s`, `details` is a list containing two tuples with the second tuple's balance and character to be determined by the next iteration, `balance` is increased by 1, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the index `i` remains at 2, the character `char` is still the second character in `s`, the list `details` remains unchanged, but the balance is increased by 1, and the standard input `stdin` remains empty.
