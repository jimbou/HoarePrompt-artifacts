Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `i` is the length of `s` minus 1, `char` is the last character in `s`, `details` is a list containing tuples where each tuple contains the balance, the negative of the index, and the character at that index, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

*   The string `s` remains unchanged, consisting only of balanced parentheses with a length not exceeding 500,000.
*   The variable `i` will hold the index of the last character in the string `s`, which is the length of `s` minus 1.
*   The variable `char` will hold the last character in the string `s`.
*   The list `details` will contain a tuple for each character in the string `s`. Each tuple will contain the balance (the difference between the number of open and close parentheses) at that index, the negative of the index, and the character at that index.
*   The standard input `stdin` remains empty.
