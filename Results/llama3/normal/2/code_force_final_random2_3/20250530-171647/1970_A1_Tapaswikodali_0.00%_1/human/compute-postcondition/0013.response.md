To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `char` (derived from `s`), as well as any other variables that are directly affected by the loop head.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 2 characters.
- `index` is 1.
- `details` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is the same as before (1 if the first character in the string `s` is an open parenthesis "(" and -1 otherwise, 0, and the first character of the string `s`), the second tuple contains the current balance, the negative of the current index, and the current character.
- `stdin` is empty.

And considering the loop statement:
```
for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
    # the loop body is omit
```

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time:

1. **`i`**: Since `i` is the index in the `enumerate(s)` loop, it needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value. Given that `index` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, and assuming `index` and `i` are related in this context (though `index` is not directly in the loop head, its state is informative about the loop's progress), `i` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

2. **`char`**: This is the next character in the string `s`. Since `s` has at least 2 characters and is a balanced parentheses sequence, the next character after the first one (considering the first iteration has already occurred) would be the second character in `s`.

3. **`s`**: The state of `s` itself does not change because it's the string being iterated over, but its length and balance properties are relevant for understanding the context of the loop.

4. **`details`**: This list contains information about the balance and characters encountered so far. The second tuple in `details` would need to reflect the updated balance and index after the next character is processed. However, since we're only considering the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't know the outcome of processing the next character yet, so we can't definitively update the balance or the character in the second tuple. The first tuple remains unchanged as it's based on the first character of `s`.

5. **`stdin`**: The state of `stdin` remains unchanged as it's not directly affected by the loop head.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" that is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000 and has at least 2 characters, `i` is 2, `char` is the second character in `s`, `details` is a list containing two tuples with the second tuple's balance and character to be determined by the next iteration, `stdin` is empty.**

Note: The exact balance and character in the second tuple of `details` cannot be determined without executing the loop body, so they are left as "to be determined by the next iteration."
