Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than q, i is 1, If the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is a list containing the square root of q. Otherwise, M remains an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while i < w:
    if q % i == 0:
        if i >= x - 1:
            M += [i]
        if q // i >= x - 1:
            M += [q // i]
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 2, `w` must be greater than 1. If `q` is a multiple of `i` and the integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` is a list containing the square root of `q` and 1 if the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, otherwise `M` is a list containing 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, otherwise `M` is a list containing `q // i` and 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, otherwise `M` is a list containing `q // i`. If `q` is not a multiple of `i`, then the state of `M` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 3, `w` must be greater than 2. If `q` is divisible by `i` (which is 3), then if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, `M` is a list containing the value of `i` (which is 3) and `q // i`. Otherwise, the state of `M` is not defined. If `q` is not divisible by `i` (which is 3), then the state of `M` is not defined.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 4, `w` must be greater than 3. If `q` is divisible by 3 and `q // 3` is greater than or equal to `x` minus 1, then `M` is a list that contains the values 3 and `q // 3`. Otherwise, if `q` is divisible by 3, `M` is a list that contains the value 3. If `q` is not divisible by 3, no changes are made.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
