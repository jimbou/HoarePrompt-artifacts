Output State: **The program returns a list M. If the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M contains the square root of q, which is an integer greater than or equal to x - 1 and less than or equal to the square root of q. Otherwise, M contains all the divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1 and less than or equal to q.**
