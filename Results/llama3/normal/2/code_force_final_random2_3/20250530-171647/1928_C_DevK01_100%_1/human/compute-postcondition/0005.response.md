To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition `i < w`. Since `i` is already defined as 1, the only variable that needs adjustment is `w`.

According to the code, `i` is less than `w` for the loop to execute. Since `i` is 1, `w` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than q, i is 1, w must be greater than 1, If the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is a list containing the square root of q. Otherwise, M remains an empty list.**
