Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 2, `w` must be greater than 2, `M` is a list that contains the value of `i` which is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `q`, `x`, `i`, and `w` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state. The only change is that the list `M` now contains the value of `i`, which is 2.
