Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 1, `w` must be greater than 1. If `q` is a multiple of `i` and the integer division of `q` by `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` is a list containing the square root of `q` and 1 if the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, otherwise `M` is a list containing 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, otherwise `M` is a list containing `q // i` and 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, otherwise `M` is a list containing `q // i`. If `q` is not a multiple of `i`, then the state of `M` remains unchanged.***
