The variables in the loop head are `i` and `w`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `w`. If `i` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `w` must be greater than 1. `w` being greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `w` must be greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 2, `w` must be greater than 2**
