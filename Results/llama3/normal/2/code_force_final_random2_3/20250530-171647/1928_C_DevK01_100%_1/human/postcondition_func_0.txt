This function generates a list of divisors for a given integer q, considering a lower bound x. It returns a list containing the square root of q if it is an integer and greater than or equal to x - 1. Otherwise, it returns a list of all divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1 and less than or equal to q. The function accepts two parameters, q and x, and returns a list of divisors that meet the specified conditions.
