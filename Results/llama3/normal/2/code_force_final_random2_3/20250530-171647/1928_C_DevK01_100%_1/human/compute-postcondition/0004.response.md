Output State: **q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than q, i is 1, If the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is a list containing the square root of q. Otherwise, M remains an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of i has been updated to 1, while the values of q, x, and M remain the same as in the initial state. The condition for M remains the same, depending on the square root of q and its relation to x.
