Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 2, `w` must be greater than 2. If `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` is a list that contains the value of `i` which is 2 and `q // i`. Otherwise, the state of `M` is not defined.***
