Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 3, `w` must be greater than 2. If `q` is divisible by `i` (which is 3), then if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x` - 1, `M` is a list containing the value of `i` (which is 3) and `q // i`. Otherwise, the state of `M` is not defined. If `q` is not divisible by `i` (which is 3), then the state of `M` is not defined.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for the state of `M` are updated to reflect the new value of `i`.
