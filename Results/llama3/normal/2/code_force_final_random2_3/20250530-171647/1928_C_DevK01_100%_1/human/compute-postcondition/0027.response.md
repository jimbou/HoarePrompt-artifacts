Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 3, `w` must be greater than 3. If `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x` minus 1, then `M` is a list that contains the values 3 and `q // 3`. Otherwise, if `q` is divisible by `i`, `M` is a list that contains the value 3. If `q` is not divisible by `i`, no changes are made.***
