Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `i` is 1 and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `w` must be greater than 1, If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the square root of `q` and 1. Otherwise, `M` is a list containing 1. The current value of `q` is a multiple of `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `q` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `w` remains the same. The list `M` now contains the value 1 in addition to its previous value. If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains the square root of `q` and 1. Otherwise, `M` contains only 1. The current value of `q` is still a multiple of `i`.
