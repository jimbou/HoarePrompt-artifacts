Postcondition: **q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than q, i is 1 and is greater than or equal to x - 1, w must be greater than 1, If the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is a list containing the square root of q. Otherwise, M remains an empty list. The current value of q is a multiple of i.**
