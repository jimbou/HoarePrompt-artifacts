Output State: **n is greater than 2, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing either the first or the last element of a and another element of a and the element at index l of a, l is either 3 or 2, r is either n - 2 or n - 3, and i is 2**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains greater than 2, and `m` remains a positive integer. The list `a` still contains `n` positive integers, and the string `s` still consists of `n` characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. The list `b` now includes the element at index `l` of `a`, in addition to its previous contents. The value of `l` has incremented by 1, making it either 3 or 2, depending on its initial value. The value of `r` remains unchanged, being either `n - 2` or `n - 3`. The variable `i` remains at 2.
