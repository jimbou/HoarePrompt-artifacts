Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing either the first or the last element of a, l is either 1 or 0, r is either n - 1 or n - 2, and i is 0. If the first character of s is 'L', then b contains the first element of a, l is 1, and r is n - 1. If the first character of s is 'R', then b contains the last element of a, l is 0, and r is n - 2.***
