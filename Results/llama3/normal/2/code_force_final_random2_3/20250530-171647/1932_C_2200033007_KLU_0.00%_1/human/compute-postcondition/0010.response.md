Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing either the first or the last element of a and another element of a, l is either 1 or 2, r is either n - 1, n - 2, or n - 3, and i is 1. If s[i] is 'L', then the element of a at index l which was either 1 or 0 is added to b, and l is either 2 or 1, r is either n - 1 or n - 2. Otherwise, the element at index r+1 of a is added to b, and l is either 1 or 0, r is either n - 2 or n - 3.***
