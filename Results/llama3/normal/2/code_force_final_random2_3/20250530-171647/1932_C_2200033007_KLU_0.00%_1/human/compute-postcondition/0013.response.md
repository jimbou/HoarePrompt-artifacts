Output State: **n is greater than 2, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing either the first or the last element of a, another element of a, and the element at index r+1 of a, l is either 2 or 1, r is either n - 3 or n - 4, and i is 2**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains greater than 2, and `m` remains a positive integer. The list `a` still contains `n` positive integers, and the string `s` still consists of `n` characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. The list `b` now contains either the first or the last element of `a`, another element of `a`, and the element at index `r+1` of `a`. The value of `l` remains either 2 or 1, and the value of `r` is decremented by 1, making it either `n - 3` or `n - 4`. The value of `i` remains 2.
