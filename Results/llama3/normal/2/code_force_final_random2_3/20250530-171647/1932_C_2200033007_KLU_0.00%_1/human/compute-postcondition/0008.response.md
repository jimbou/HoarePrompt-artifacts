Output State: **n is greater than 1, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing either the first or the last element of a and the element of a at index l which was either 1 or 0, l is either 2 or 1, r is either n - 1 or n - 2, and i is 1.**

The code first appends the element of `a` at index `l` to `b`. Since `l` is either 1 or 0, this adds the second or first element of `a` to `b`. Then, `l` is incremented by 1, making it either 2 or 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
