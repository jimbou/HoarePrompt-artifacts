Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is an empty list, l is 0, r is n - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == 'L':
        b.append(a[l])
        l += 1
    else:
        b.append(a[r])
        r -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 0, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing either the first or the last element of a, l is either 1 or 0, r is either n - 1 or n - 2, and i is 0. If the first character of s is 'L', then b contains the first element of a, l is 1, and r is n - 1. If the first character of s is 'R', then b contains the last element of a, l is 0, and r is n - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 1, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing either the first or the last element of a and another element of a, l is either 1 or 2, r is either n - 1, n - 2, or n - 3, and i is 1. If s[i] is 'L', then the element of a at index l which was either 1 or 0 is added to b, and l is either 2 or 1, r is either n - 1 or n - 2. Otherwise, the element at index r+1 of a is added to b, and l is either 1 or 0, r is either n - 2 or n - 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 2, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing either the first or the last element of a and another element of a. If s[i] is 'L', then b also contains the element at index l of a, l is either 3 or 2, r is either n - 2 or n - 3, and i is 2. If s[i] is 'R', then b also contains the element at index r+1 of a, l is either 2 or 1, r is either n - 3 or n - 4, and i is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
