Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing either the first or the last element of a and another element of a. If s[i] is 'L', then b also contains the element at index l of a, l is either 3 or 2, r is either n - 2 or n - 3, and i is 2. If s[i] is 'R', then b also contains the element at index r+1 of a, l is either 2 or 1, r is either n - 3 or n - 4, and i is 2.***
