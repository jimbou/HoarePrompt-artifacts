Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by processing the commands in the order they are written in the string s. The program first rearranges the input list a according to the order specified by the string s, then calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged list in reverse order. The resulting list of products is returned in reverse order, which is the correct output according to the problem description.

The program uses a two-pointer technique to rearrange the input list a according to the order specified by the string s. It uses two pointers, l and r, to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the list a, respectively. It then iterates over the string s and appends the corresponding elements from the list a to the list b based on the commands in the string s.

After rearranging the list a, the program calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged list in reverse order. It uses a variable p to keep track of the cumulative product and iterates over the list b in reverse order. For each element v in the list b, it multiplies the cumulative product p by v and appends the result to the list ans.

Finally, the program returns the list ans in reverse order, which is the correct output according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
