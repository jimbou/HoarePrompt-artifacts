#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R'.

    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing all elements of a in the order determined by s, l is n, r is -1, and i is n - 1.

    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing all elements of a in the order determined by s that must have at least n elements, l is n, r is -1, i is n - 1, ans is a list containing the product of p and v, p is the product of p and v, v is the first element in the list b
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the reversed list of products of p and v, where p is the product of p and v, and v is the first element in the list b, which contains all elements of a in the order determined by s, and a is a list of n positive integers, and n is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of positive integers and a string of 'L' and 'R' characters as input, and returns a list of products. The function rearranges the input list according to the order specified by the string, then calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged list in reverse order. The resulting list of products is returned in reverse order.
