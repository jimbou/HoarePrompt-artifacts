Output State: **n is greater than 0, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing the first element of a, l is 1, r is n - 1, and i is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains greater than 0, and `m` remains a positive integer. The list `a` still contains `n` positive integers, and the string `s` still has `n` characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. The list `b` now contains the first element of `a`, which was appended to it. The value of `l` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The value of `r` remains `n - 1`, and `i` remains 0.
