The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `stdin`. If `stdin` contains at least 1 input the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` contains at least 0 inputs. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `stdin` must have at least 1 input.
State: **`s` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains at least 1 inputs.**
