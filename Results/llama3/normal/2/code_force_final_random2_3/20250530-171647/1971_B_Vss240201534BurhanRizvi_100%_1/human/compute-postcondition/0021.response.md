Output State: **`s` is a string, stdin contains at least 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to a string, which is the input accepted from stdin. The stdin now contains at least 0 inputs, meaning it may be empty or still contain some inputs. The initial state of `s` being an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) is no longer valid, as `s` is now a string.
