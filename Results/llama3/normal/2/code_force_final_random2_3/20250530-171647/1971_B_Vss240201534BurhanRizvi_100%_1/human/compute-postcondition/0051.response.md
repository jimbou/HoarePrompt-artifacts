Functionality: **This function reads a series of strings from standard input, where the first input specifies the number of strings to follow. For each string, it checks if the string has a length of 1 or if all characters are the same. If either condition is true, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by a modified version of the string, which is either a shuffled version of the original string or a rotated version where the first character is moved to the end. The function processes the specified number of strings and prints the corresponding output for each one.**
