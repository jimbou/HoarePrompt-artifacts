Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the edge cases where the string has a length of 1 or all characters are the same, in which case it prints 'No'. For other strings, it generates a modified version of the string by either shuffling it or rotating it, and prints 'Yes' followed by the modified string. The use of `random.sample` ensures that the shuffled string is a random permutation of the original string, and the rotation approach ensures that the modified string is different from the original string. The program also correctly handles the specified number of test cases and prints the corresponding output for each one.

Correctness: **True**
