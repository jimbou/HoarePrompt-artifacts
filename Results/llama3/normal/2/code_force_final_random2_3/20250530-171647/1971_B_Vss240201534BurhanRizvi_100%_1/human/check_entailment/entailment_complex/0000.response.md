Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. It correctly handles the case where the input string has a length of 1, in which case it's impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to the original string.

2. It correctly handles the case where all characters in the input string are the same. In this case, any rearrangement of the characters will result in the same string, so it's impossible to form a new string that is not equal to the original string.

3. For all other cases, it generates a new string by shuffling the characters of the original string. If the shuffled string happens to be the same as the original string (which is possible, although unlikely), it generates a new string by rotating the original string, moving the first character to the end. This ensures that the new string is always different from the original string.

4. The program correctly prints "YES" followed by the new string when it's possible to form a new string that is not equal to the original string, and it correctly prints "NO" when it's impossible to do so.

Correctness: **True**
