Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains at least 0 inputs. If the length of `s` is 1, 'No' is printed. If the length of `s` is greater than 1 and all elements of `s` are equal, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, a string `s2` of the same length as `s` containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order is created. If `s` is equal to `s2`, the first character of `s` is moved to the end of `s2`, 'Yes' is printed, and `s2` is printed.***
