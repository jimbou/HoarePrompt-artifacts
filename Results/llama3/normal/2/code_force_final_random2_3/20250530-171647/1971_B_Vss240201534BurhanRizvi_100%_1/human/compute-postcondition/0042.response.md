Output State: **`s` is the first input from stdin, `s2` is a rotated version of `s` where the first character is moved to the end, stdin contains at least 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `s` remains unchanged as it is the first input from stdin. However, the value of `s2` is updated by rotating the original string `s` one position to the right, effectively moving the first character to the end of the string. The number of inputs in stdin remains the same, with at least 0 inputs still available.
