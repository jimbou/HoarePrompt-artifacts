You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t+1 inputs: the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), and the remaining t inputs are strings of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: The loop has executed for the number of times specified by the integer t in the first input from stdin. For each iteration, if the length of the input string s is 1, 'No' is printed. If the length of s is greater than 1 and all characters in s are the same, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed along with either a shuffled version of s or a rotated version of s where the first character is moved to the end.

```

Return Postconditions: The loop has executed for the number of times specified by the integer t in the first input from stdin. For each iteration, if the length of the input string s is 1, 'No' is printed. If the length of s is greater than 1 and all characters in s are the same, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed along with either a shuffled version of s or a rotated version of s where the first character is moved to the end.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
