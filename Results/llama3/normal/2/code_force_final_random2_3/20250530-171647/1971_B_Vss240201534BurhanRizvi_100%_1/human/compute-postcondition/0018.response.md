Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains at least 0 inputs, and the length of `s` is not equal to 1. If all elements of `s` are equal and the length of `s` is greater than 1, then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, `s2` is a string of the same length as `s` containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then the first character of `s` is moved to the end of `s2`, 'Yes' is printed, and `s2` is printed.***
