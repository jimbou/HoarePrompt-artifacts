Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, stdin contains at least 0 inputs. If the length of `s` is 1, then 'No' is being printed. If the length of `s` is larger than 1 and all characters in `s` are the same, then 'No' is being printed. Otherwise, `s2` is a string that is a permutation of `s`, if `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is equal to `s[1:] + s[0]`, and 'Yes' is being printed, and `s2` is printed.***
