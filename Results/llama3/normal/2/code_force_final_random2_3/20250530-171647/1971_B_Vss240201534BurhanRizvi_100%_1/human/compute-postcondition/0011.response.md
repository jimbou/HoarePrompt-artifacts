Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains at least 0 inputs, and the length of `s` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either the length of `s` is 1 or the set of `s` contains more than one unique element. The current value of `s` is equal to `s2`, which is a string of the same length as `s` containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order.***
