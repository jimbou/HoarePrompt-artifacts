Postcondition: ***`s` is the first input from stdin, stdin contains at least 0 inputs. If the length of `s` is 1, 'No' is printed. If `s` contains only one unique character and its length is more than 1, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed along with either a shuffled version of `s` or a rotated version of `s` where the first character is moved to the end.***
