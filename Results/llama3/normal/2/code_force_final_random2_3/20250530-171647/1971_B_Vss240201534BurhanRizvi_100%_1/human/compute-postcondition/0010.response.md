Output State: **`s` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains at least 0 inputs, and the length of `s` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either the length of `s` is 1 or the set of `s` contains more than one unique element, `s2` is a string of the same length as `s` containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order.**

In this output state, the value of `s` remains unchanged, and the length of `s` is still not equal to 1. The stdin still contains at least 0 inputs. Additionally, either the length of `s` is 1 or the set of `s` contains more than one unique element. A new variable `s2` is introduced, which is a string of the same length as `s` containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order, as a result of the `random.sample` function.
