Output: **`s` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains at least 0 inputs, the length of `s` is not equal to 1, either the length of `s` is 1 or the set of `s` contains more than one unique element, and `s2` is a string of the same length as `s` containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then the first character of `s` is moved to the end of `s2`, and 'Yes' is being printed, and s2 is printed**
