Output State: **`s` is a string, `s2` is a string that is a permutation of `s` and is equal to `s[1:] + s[0]`, stdin contains at least 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `s` remains unchanged, but the value of `s2` is updated to be a permutation of `s` by moving the first character of `s` to the end. The stdin remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
