Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t+1 inputs: the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), and the remaining t inputs are strings of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    if len(s) == 1:
        print('No')
    elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
        print('No')
    else:
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s == s2:
            s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
        print('Yes')
        print(s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains at least 0 inputs. If the length of `s` is 1, 'No' is printed. If the length of `s` is greater than 1 and all elements of `s` are equal, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, a string `s2` of the same length as `s` containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order is created. If `s` is equal to `s2`, the first character of `s` is moved to the end of `s2`, 'Yes' is printed, and `s2` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string, stdin contains at least 0 inputs. If the length of `s` is 1, then 'No' is being printed. If the length of `s` is larger than 1 and all characters in `s` are the same, then 'No' is being printed. Otherwise, `s2` is a string that is a permutation of `s`, if `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is equal to `s[1:] + s[0]`, and 'Yes' is being printed, and `s2` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is the first input from stdin, stdin contains at least 0 inputs. If the length of `s` is 1, 'No' is printed. If `s` contains only one unique character and its length is more than 1, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed along with either a shuffled version of `s` or a rotated version of `s` where the first character is moved to the end.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
