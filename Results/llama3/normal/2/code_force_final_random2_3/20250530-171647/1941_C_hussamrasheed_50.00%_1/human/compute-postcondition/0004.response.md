The code prints the sum of the count of 'map' in the original string s and the count of 'pie' in the string s after removing 'map'.
Output: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^6) and must be greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, s is a string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, m is the count of 'map' in the original string s, p is the count of 'pie' in the string s after removing 'map', stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the sum of m and p is printed**
