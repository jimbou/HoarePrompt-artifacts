The code prints the sum of the count of 'map' in the original string s and the count of 'pie' in the string s after removing 'map'. Where m is the count of 'map' in the original string s and p is the count of 'pie' in the string s after removing 'map'.

Output: **m + p (where m is the count of 'map' in the original string s and p is the count of 'pie' in the string s after removing 'map')**
