The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s. It counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in the original string s, removes all occurrences of 'map' from the string, counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string, and prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie'. The function processes all test cases and prints the results for each case.
