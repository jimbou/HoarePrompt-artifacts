The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) and then a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Since the first input is accepted, there are now t-1 test cases remaining in the stdin. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^6), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) and then a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
