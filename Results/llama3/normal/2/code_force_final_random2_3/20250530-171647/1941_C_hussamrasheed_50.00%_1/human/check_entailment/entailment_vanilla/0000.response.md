Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. The given program defines a function func() that reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads the length of the string n and the string s.

3. It then counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in the string s and stores it in the variable m.

4. It replaces all occurrences of "map" in the string s with an empty string, effectively removing them.

5. It then counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string s and stores it in the variable p.

6. Finally, it prints the sum of m and p, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful.

7. The program's logic is correct because it first removes all occurrences of "map" and then counts the occurrences of "pie". This ensures that any overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" are handled correctly.

8. The program also handles the case where the string s is already beautiful by printing 0.

9. The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the string s, because it uses the count() and replace() methods which have a time complexity of O(n).

10. The space complexity of the program is also O(n) because it creates a new string by replacing all occurrences of "map" with an empty string.

Correctness: **True**
