Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
3. It correctly counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in the original string `s` using the `count()` method and stores it in the variable `m`.
4. It removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s` using the `replace()` method.
5. It correctly counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` (after removing "map") using the `count()` method and stores it in the variable `p`.
6. It prints the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie", which is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The execution states provided as comments also confirm that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
