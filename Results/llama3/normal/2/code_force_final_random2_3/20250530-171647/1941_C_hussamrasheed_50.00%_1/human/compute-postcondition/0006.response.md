Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^6) and must be greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer, s is a string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, m is the count of 'map' in the original string s, p is the count of 'pie' in the string s after removing 'map', stdin contains t-4 test cases**

In this output state, the value of t remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of i also remains unchanged as it is not used or modified by the code. The value of n is updated to be an integer input from stdin. The value of s is updated to be a string with all occurrences of 'map' removed. The value of m is updated to be the count of 'map' in the original string s. The value of p is updated to be the count of 'pie' in the string s after removing 'map'. The stdin now contains t-4 test cases as two inputs have been read from stdin.
