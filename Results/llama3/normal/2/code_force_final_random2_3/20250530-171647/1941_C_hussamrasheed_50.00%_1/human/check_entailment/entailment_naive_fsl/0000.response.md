Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in cases where the string contains overlapping substrings "map" and "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two separate substrings and output 2, but the correct output should be 1 because only one character needs to be removed to make the string beautiful.

The program's approach of counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" separately and then printing their sum is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of overlapping substrings. A correct approach would be to iterate through the string and check for the presence of "map" and "pie" at each position, removing the minimum number of characters necessary to make the string beautiful.
