Output State: **t is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^6) and must be greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer, s is a string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, m is the count of 'map' in the original string s, p is the count of 'pie' in the string s after removing 'map', stdin contains t-6 test cases.**

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

*   The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1, making it `t-6`.
*   The second line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `s`. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1, making it `t-6`.
*   The third line counts the occurrences of 'map' in the original string `s` and assigns it to `m`.
*   The fourth line removes all occurrences of 'map' from the string `s`.
*   The fifth line counts the occurrences of 'pie' in the string `s` after removing 'map' and assigns it to `p`.

The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The sum of the count of 'map' in the original string `s` and the count of 'pie' in the string `s` after removing 'map' which is `m + p` is being printed.
