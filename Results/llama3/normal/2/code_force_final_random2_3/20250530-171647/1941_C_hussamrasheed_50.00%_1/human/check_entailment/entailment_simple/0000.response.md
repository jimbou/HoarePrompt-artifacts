Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string s. The program first counts the number of occurrences of "map" and stores it in the variable m. Then, it removes all occurrences of "map" from the string s. After that, it counts the number of occurrences of "pie" in the modified string s and stores it in the variable p. Finally, it prints the sum of m and p, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful.

The program correctly handles the case where the string s is already beautiful, in which case it prints 0. It also correctly handles the case where the string s contains multiple occurrences of "map" and "pie", and it correctly counts the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
