The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^6) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the count of 'map' in the original string `s`, `p` is the count of 'pie' in the string `s` after removing 'map', `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, and the sum of the count of 'map' in the original string `s` and the count of 'pie' in the string `s` after removing 'map' which is `m + p` is being printed**
