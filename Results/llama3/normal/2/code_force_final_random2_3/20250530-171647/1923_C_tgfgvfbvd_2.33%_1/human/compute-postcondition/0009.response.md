To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. The other variables are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `x` is the last integer in the list**
