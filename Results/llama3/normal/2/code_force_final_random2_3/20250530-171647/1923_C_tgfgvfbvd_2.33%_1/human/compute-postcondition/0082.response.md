To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop executes. 

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 1 integer, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `_` is `m`, `x` is the first integer in the list `l`, `a` is an integer equal to the first input, `b` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is undefined, stdin is empty**
