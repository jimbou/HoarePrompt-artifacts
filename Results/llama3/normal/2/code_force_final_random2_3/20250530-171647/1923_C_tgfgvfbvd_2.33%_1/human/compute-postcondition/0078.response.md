Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer greater than 2, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in l, _ is 2, x is the last integer in the list l, a is an integer equal to the first input, b is an integer equal to the second input. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is equal to the cumulative sum of the first b-1 integers in l minus the cumulative sum of the first a-2 integers in l. Otherwise, no changes are made. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
