The only object in the loop head is variable x and list l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer, m is an integer, p is an empty list, c is 0, _ is 1, stdin is empty. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the x is the first integer in the list.
State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, p is an empty list, c is 0, _ is 1, stdin is empty, x is the first integer in the list**
