Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to a, m is greater than 2, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is 2, x is undefined, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to the b-1th element of p. If a - 2 >= 0, then p is an empty list and c is 0. Otherwise, the state of p and c cannot be accurately determined.***
