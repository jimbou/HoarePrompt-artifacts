Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is m, x is undefined, a is an integer equal to the first input, b is an integer equal to the second input, s is undefined, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer equal to a, m is greater than 0, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is 0, x is undefined, a is an integer, b is an integer. If a is greater or equal to 2, s is equal to the b-1th element of p minus the a-2th element of p. Otherwise, s is equal to the b-1th element of p. If the difference between b and a plus 1 is greater than 1 and the current value of s is greater than or equal to 2 times the difference between b and a plus 1, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer equal to a, m is greater than 1, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is 1, x is undefined, a is an integer, b is an integer. If a is larger or equal to 2, s is equal to the b-1th element of p minus the a-2th element of p. Otherwise, s is equal to the b-1th element of p. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer equal to a, m is greater than 2, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is 2, x is undefined, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to the b-1th element of p. If a - 2 >= 0, then p is an empty list and c is 0. Otherwise, the state of p and c cannot be accurately determined. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
