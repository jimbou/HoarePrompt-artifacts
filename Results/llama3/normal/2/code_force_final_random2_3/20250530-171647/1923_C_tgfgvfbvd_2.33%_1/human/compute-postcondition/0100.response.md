Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to a, m is greater than 0, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is 0, x is undefined, a is an integer, b is an integer. If a is greater or equal to 2, s is equal to the b-1th element of p minus the a-2th element of p. Otherwise, s is equal to the b-1th element of p. If the difference between b and a plus 1 is greater than 1 and the current value of s is greater than or equal to 2 times the difference between b and a plus 1, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
