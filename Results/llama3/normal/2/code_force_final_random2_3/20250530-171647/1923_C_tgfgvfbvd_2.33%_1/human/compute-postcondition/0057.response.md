Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in l, _ is 0, x is the last integer in the list l, a is an integer equal to the first input, b is an integer equal to the second input. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is equal to the cumulative sum of the first b-1-a+1 integers in l. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, either b - a + 1 is less than or equal to 1, or s is less than 2 * (b - a + 1).***
