Reasoning: The program is correct. It correctly calculates the cumulative sum of the array and then checks for each query if the subarray is good by checking if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. This is because a good subarray must have a sum that is at least twice the length of the subarray, since each element in the subarray must be greater than 0 and not equal to the corresponding element in the original array.

Correctness: **True**
