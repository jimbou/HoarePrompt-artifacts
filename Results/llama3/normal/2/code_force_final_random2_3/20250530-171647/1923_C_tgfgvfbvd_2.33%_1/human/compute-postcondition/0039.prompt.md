Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in l, c is the sum of all integers in l, _ is 1, stdin is empty, x is the last integer in the list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is at least 1, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in l, c is the sum of all integers in l, _ is 0, stdin is empty, x is the last integer in the list, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index b-1. If a is at least 2, s is the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index b-1 minus the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index a-2. Otherwise, no change is made to s. If the current value of (b - a + 1) is greater than 1 and the current value of s is greater than or equal to 2 times (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either (b - a + 1) is less than or equal to 1 or s is less than 2 * (b - a + 1), and 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is at least 2, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in l, c is the sum of all integers in l, _ is 1, stdin is empty, x is the last integer in the list, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index b-1. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index b-1 minus the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index a-2. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, m is at least 2, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in l, c is the sum of all integers in l, _ is 2, stdin is empty, x is the last integer in the list, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index b-1. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index b-1 minus the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index a-2. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
