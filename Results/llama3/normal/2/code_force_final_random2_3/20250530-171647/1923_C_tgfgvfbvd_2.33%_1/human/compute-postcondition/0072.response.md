Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in `l`, `_` is 2, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `a` is an integer equal to the first input, `b` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is equal to the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` integers in `l` minus the cumulative sum of the first `a-2` integers in `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by subtracting the cumulative sum of the first `a-2` integers in `l` from its original value, which was the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` integers in `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
