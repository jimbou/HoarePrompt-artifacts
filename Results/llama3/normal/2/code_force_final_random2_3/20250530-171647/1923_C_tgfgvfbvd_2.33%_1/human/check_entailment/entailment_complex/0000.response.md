Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `m`, and the array `c` itself.
2. It calculates the cumulative sum of the array `c` and stores it in the list `p`. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.
3. For each query, the program correctly calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a:b]` by subtracting the cumulative sum at index `a-2` from the cumulative sum at index `b-1`. This is because the cumulative sum at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the array.
4. The program then checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray (`2 * (b - a + 1)`). This is the condition for a subarray to be "good" according to the problem statement.
5. If the condition is true, the program prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The execution states of the program provided as comments also match the expected behavior. The program correctly initializes and updates the variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s` as described in the comments.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
