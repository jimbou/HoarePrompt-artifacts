The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line increments the value of `c` by the value of `x`, which is the third integer in the list `l`. The second line appends the updated value of `c` to the list `p`.

Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, p is a list containing the first integer in l, the sum of the first and second integers in l, and the sum of the first two integers in l plus the third integer in l, c is the sum of the first two integers in l plus the third integer in l, _ is 1, stdin is empty, x is the third integer in the list.**
