Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers from stdin that must have at least 3 integers, p is a list containing the value of x, the value of x plus c, and the value of x plus c plus x, c is equal to the value of x plus c plus x, _ is m, x is the third integer in the list l, a is an integer equal to the first input, b is an integer equal to the second input, s is undefined, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been incremented by the value of `x`, and this new value of `c` has been appended to the list `p`. The value of `x` remains the same, as it is the third integer in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
