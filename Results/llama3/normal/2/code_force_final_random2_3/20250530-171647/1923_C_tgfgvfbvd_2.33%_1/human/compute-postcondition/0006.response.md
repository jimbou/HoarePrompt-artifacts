To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for x in l:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of list `l`. The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `n` is an integer
* `m` is an integer
* `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers
* `p` is a list containing the first integer in `l` and the sum of the first and second integers in `l`
* `c` is the sum of the first and second integers in `l`
* `_` is 1
* `stdin` is empty
* `x` is the second integer in the list

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* `x` is the loop variable, which will take on the next value in the list `l`. Since `x` is currently the second integer in the list, the next value will be the third integer in the list.
* `l` is the list being iterated over, and its state remains the same.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `p`, `c`, `_`, and `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `p` is a list containing the first integer in `l` and the sum of the first and second integers in `l`, `c` is the sum of the first and second integers in `l`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `x` is the third integer in the list**
