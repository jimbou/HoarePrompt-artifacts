Output: **n is an integer, m is at least 2, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in l, c is the sum of all integers in l, _ is 1, stdin is empty, x is the last integer in the list, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index b-1. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index b-1 minus the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index a-2., and 'YES' is printed**
