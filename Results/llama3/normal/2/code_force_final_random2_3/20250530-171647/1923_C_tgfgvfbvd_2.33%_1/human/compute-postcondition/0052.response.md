Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in `l`, `_` is 0, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `a` is an integer equal to the first input, `b` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is equal to the cumulative sum of the first `b-1-a+1` integers in `l`**.

The value of `s` is updated by subtracting the cumulative sum of the first `a-2` integers in `l`, which is stored in `p[a-2]`. This means that `s` now represents the cumulative sum of the integers in `l` from index `a-1` to `b-2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
