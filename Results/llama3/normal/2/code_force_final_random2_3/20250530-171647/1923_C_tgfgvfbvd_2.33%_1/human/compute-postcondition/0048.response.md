Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in l, _ is m-1, stdin is empty, x is the last integer in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is not defined**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for all variables except those affected by the loop. The list `p` will contain the cumulative sum of all integers in list `l`, and the variable `c` will hold the total sum of all integers in `l`. The variable `x` will be the last integer in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
