Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer that must be greater than 0, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in l, _ is 0, stdin is empty, x is the last integer in the list l, a is an integer equal to the first input, b is an integer equal to the second input, s is equal to the cumulative sum of the first b-1 integers in l.**

The code first assigns the values of two inputs to `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` were previously integers, they remain integers, but their values are now equal to the first and second inputs, respectively. The second line assigns the value of the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` integers in `l` to `s`. Since `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in `l`, `s` is equal to the value at index `b-1` in `p`. No other variables are affected.
