Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer greater than 2, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in l, _ is 2, x is the last integer in the list l, a is an integer equal to the first input, b is an integer equal to the second input, s is equal to the cumulative sum of the first b-1 integers in l.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `_`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the first and second inputs, respectively. The value of `s` is updated to the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` integers in `l`, which is stored in the list `p` at index `b-1`.
