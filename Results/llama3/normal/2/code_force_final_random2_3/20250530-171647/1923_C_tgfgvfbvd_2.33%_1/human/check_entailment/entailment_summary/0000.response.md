Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2.  It calculates the cumulative sum of the array `c` and stores it in the list `p`. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.
3.  For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a-1], c[a], ..., c[b-1]` by subtracting the cumulative sum at index `a-2` from the cumulative sum at index `b-1`. This is correct because the cumulative sum at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the array.
4.  It checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. This is the correct condition to check if the subarray is good, as stated in the problem description.
5.  If the condition is true, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
