The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and list  l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, l has at least 1 integer, x is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the x is the second integer in the list.
State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, p is a list containing the first integer in l, c is the first integer in l, _ is 1, stdin is empty, x is the second integer in the list**
