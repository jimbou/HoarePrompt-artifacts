Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, p is a list containing the value of x and x + x, c is equal to x + x, _ is m-1, stdin is empty, x is the second integer in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is not defined**

The first line increments the value of `c` by the value of `x`, making `c` equal to `x + x`. The second line appends the new value of `c` to the list `p`, adding the value of `x + x` to the list. No other variables are affected.
