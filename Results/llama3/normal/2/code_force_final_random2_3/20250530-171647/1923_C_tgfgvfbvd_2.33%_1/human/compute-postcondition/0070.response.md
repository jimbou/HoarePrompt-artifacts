The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, m is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again m must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer, m is an integer greater than 2, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in l, _ is 2, x is the last integer in the list l, a is an integer equal to the first input, b is an integer equal to the second input. If a - 2 >= 0, s is equal to the cumulative sum of the first b-1 integers in l minus the cumulative sum of the first a-2 integers in l. Otherwise, s is equal to the cumulative sum of the first b-1 integers in l. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
