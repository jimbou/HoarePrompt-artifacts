The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, m is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again m must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer equal to a, m is greater than 2, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is 2, x is undefined, a is an integer, b is an integer. If a is larger or equal to 2, s is equal to the b-1th element of p minus the a-2th element of p. Otherwise, s is equal to the b-1th element of p. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.**
