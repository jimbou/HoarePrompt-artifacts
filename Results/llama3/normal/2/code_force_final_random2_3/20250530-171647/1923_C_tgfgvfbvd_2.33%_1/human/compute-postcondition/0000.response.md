To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute if the input from `stdin` contains at least one test case. Therefore, the state of the input from `stdin` needs to be adjusted to contain at least one test case.

State: **stdin contains at least one test case, `_` is 1**
