Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is at least 1, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in l, c is the sum of all integers in l, _ is 0, stdin is empty, x is the last integer in the list, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index b-1. If a is at least 2, s is the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index b-1 minus the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index a-2. Otherwise, no change is made to s. Additionally, either (b - a + 1) is less than or equal to 1 or s is less than 2 * (b - a + 1).***
