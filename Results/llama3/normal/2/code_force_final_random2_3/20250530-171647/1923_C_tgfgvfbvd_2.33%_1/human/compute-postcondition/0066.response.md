Output: **n is an integer, m is an integer greater than 1, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in l, _ is 1, x is the last integer in the list l, a is an integer equal to the first input, b is an integer equal to the second input. If a - 2 >= 0, s is equal to the cumulative sum of the first b-1 integers in l minus the cumulative sum of the first a-2 integers in l. Otherwise, s is equal to the cumulative sum of the first b-1 integers in l, and 'YES' is printed**
