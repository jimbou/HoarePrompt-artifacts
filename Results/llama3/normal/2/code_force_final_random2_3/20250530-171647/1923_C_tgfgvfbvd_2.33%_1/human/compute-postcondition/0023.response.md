Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is at least 2, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `x` is the last integer in the list, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of the integers in `l` up to index `b-1` minus the cumulative sum of the integers in `l` up to index `a-2`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by subtracting the cumulative sum of the integers in `l` up to index `a-2` from its previous value, which was the cumulative sum of the integers in `l` up to index `b-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
