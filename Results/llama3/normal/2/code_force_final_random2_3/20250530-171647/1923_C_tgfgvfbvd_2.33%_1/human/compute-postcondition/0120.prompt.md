Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two integers, and then a list of integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The two integers are the length of the array and the number of queries. The list of integers is the array. Each query contains two integers: the borders of the subarray.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    c = 0
    for x in l:
        c += x
        p.append(c)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        s = p[b - 1]
        if a - 2 >= 0:
            s -= p[a - 2]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is at least m, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in l, c is the sum of all integers in l, _ is m, stdin is empty, x is the last integer in the list, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index b-1. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index b-1 minus the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index a-2. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer equal to 0, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in l, _ is m, x is the last integer in the list l, a is an integer equal to the first input, b is an integer equal to the second input. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is equal to the cumulative sum of the first b-1 integers in l minus the cumulative sum of the first a-2 integers in l. Otherwise, no changes are made. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is equal to 0, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is m, x is undefined, a is an integer equal to the first input, b is an integer equal to the second input, s is undefined, stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
