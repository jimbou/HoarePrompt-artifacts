The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `m`. If `_` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in `l`, `c` is equal to the sum of all integers in `l`, `_` is 1, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `a` is an integer equal to the first input, `b` is an integer equal to the second input, `s` is equal to the cumulative sum of the first `b-1-a+1` integers in `l` if `a - 2 >= 0`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged**
