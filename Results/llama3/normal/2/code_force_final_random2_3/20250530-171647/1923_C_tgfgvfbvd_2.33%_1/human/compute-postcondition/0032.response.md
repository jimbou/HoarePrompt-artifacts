Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is at least 2, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in `l`, `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `x` is the last integer in the list, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of the integers in `l` up to index `b-1` minus the cumulative sum of the integers in `l` up to index `a-2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `_`, `stdin`, `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated by subtracting the cumulative sum of the integers in `l` up to index `a-2` from its previous value, which was the cumulative sum of the integers in `l` up to index `b-1`.
