Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray is good or not. It first calculates the prefix sum of the array `c`, which allows it to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.

For each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. This is because the sum of the subarray must be distributed among the elements of the subarray, and each element must be greater than 0. If the sum is not sufficient to distribute among all elements, the subarray is not good.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the subarray has only one element or when the subarray starts from the first element of the original array.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
