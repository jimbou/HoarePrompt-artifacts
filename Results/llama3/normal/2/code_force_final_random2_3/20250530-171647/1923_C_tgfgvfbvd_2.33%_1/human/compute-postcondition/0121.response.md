Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing an integer, two integers, and a list of integers. It calculates the cumulative sum of the list and then processes a number of queries, each containing two integers representing the borders of a subarray. For each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray and prints 'YES' if true, 'NO' otherwise. The function repeats this process for all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input variables in a state where all lists are empty and all integers are 0, with standard input being empty.**
