The only variables in the loop head are variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, m is at least 2. For the loop to execute again _ must be 2.
State: **n is an integer, m is at least 2, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in l, c is the sum of all integers in l, _ is 2, stdin is empty, x is the last integer in the list, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index b-1. If a - 2 >= 0, then s is the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index b-1 minus the cumulative sum of the integers in l up to index a-2. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1), then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
