Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in l, c is the sum of all integers in l, _ is 1, stdin is empty, x is the last integer in the list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `p` contains the cumulative sums of the integers in list `l`, and the variable `c` holds the total sum of all integers in list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
