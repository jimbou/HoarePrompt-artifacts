Output: **n is an integer equal to a, m is greater than 0, l is an empty list, p is a list containing the cumulative sum of all integers in the list l, c is equal to the sum of all integers in the list l, _ is 0, x is undefined, a is an integer, b is an integer, if a is greater or equal to 2, s is equal to the b-1th element of p minus the a-2th element of p. Otherwise, s is equal to the b-1th element of p. Additionally, either (b - a + 1) is less than or equal to 1 or s is less than 2 * (b - a + 1), and 'NO' is being printed**
