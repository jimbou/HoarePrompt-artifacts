Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is zero, `a` is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least n+3 elements, `w` is the (n+1)th smallest float in `a`, `x` is the (n+2)th smallest float in `a`, `y` is the (n+3)th smallest float in `a`, `z` is the (n+4)th smallest float in `a`, `v` is y - x, `b` is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, `u` is the first input from stdin, `c` and `d` are the last two inputs from stdin.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is 0, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least n+3 elements, w is the (n+1)th smallest float in a, x is the (n+2)th smallest float in a, y is the (n+3)th smallest float in a, z is the (n+4)th smallest float in a, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, u is a falsy value, c is the first input from stdin, d is the second input from stdin. If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*d - 2)th element of b and the (2*c - 2)th element of b is being printed. If c is not less than d, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of the modified list b is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *t is 0, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least n+3 elements, w is the (n+1)th smallest float in a, x is the (n+2)th smallest float in a, y is the (n+3)th smallest float in a, z is the (n+4)th smallest float in a, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, u is 0, c is the first input from stdin, d is the second input from stdin. If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*(d-1))th element of b and the (2*(c-1))th element of b is being printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of b and the (2*d - 1)th element of b is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is 0, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least n+3 elements, w is the (n+1)th smallest float in a, x is the (n+2)th smallest float in a, y is the (n+3)th smallest float in a, z is the (n+4)th smallest float in a, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, u is False, c and d are the first and second inputs from stdin respectively. If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*(d-1))th and (2*(c-1))th elements of b is being printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th and (2*d - 1)th elements of the modified list b is being printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
