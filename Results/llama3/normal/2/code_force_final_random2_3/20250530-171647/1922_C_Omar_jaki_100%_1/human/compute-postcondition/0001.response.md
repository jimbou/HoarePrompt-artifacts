The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, t is a positive integer, So for the loop to  executed the first time t must be greater than 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: a list of unique integers in ascending order, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers. t must be greater than 0**
