Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of four inputs: an integer, a list of unique integers in ascending order, another integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers. It then processes each test case by calculating and printing the differences between specific elements in a modified list, based on the input pairs. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point it terminates with an empty standard input.**
