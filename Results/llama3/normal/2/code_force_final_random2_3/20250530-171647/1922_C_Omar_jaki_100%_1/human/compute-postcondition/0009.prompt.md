Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: a list of unique integers in ascending order, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers. a is a list of unique floats in ascending order, including -1000000000.0 and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least 4 elements, w is -1000000000.0, x is the second smallest float in a, y is the third smallest float in a, z is the fourth smallest float in a, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least 5 elements, w is the second smallest float in a, x is the third smallest float in a, y is the fourth smallest float in a, z is the fifth smallest float in a, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least 6 elements, w is the third smallest float in a, x is the fourth smallest float in a, y is the fifth smallest float in a, z is the sixth smallest float in a, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
