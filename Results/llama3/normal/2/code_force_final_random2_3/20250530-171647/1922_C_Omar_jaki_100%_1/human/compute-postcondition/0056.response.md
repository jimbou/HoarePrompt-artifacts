The code prints the difference between the ((d - 1) * 2)th element and the ((c - 1) * 2)th element of the list b. Where d is the second input from stdin and c is the first input from stdin.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where d is the second input from stdin and c is the first input from stdin)**
