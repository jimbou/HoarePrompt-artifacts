Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is non-zero and decreased by 1, stdin is empty, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least n+3 elements, w is the (n-1)th smallest float in a, x is the nth smallest float in a, y is the (n+1)th smallest float in a, z is the (n+2)th smallest float in a, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, u is 0, c and d are the last two inputs from stdin. If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*d - 2)th element and the (2*c - 2)th element of b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of b is printed.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is non-zero and decreased by 1, stdin is empty, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least 4 elements, w is the first element in the list, x is the second element in the list, y is the third element in the list, z is the fourth element in the list, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, u is 0, c and d are the last two inputs from stdin. If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*d - 2)th element and the (2*c - 2)th element of b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of b is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is non-zero and decreased by 1, stdin is empty, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least 5 elements, w is the second element in the list, x is the third element in the list, y is the fourth element in the list, z is the fifth element in the list, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, u is 0, c and d are empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is non-zero and decreased by 1, stdin is empty, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least 6 elements, w is the third element in the list, x is the fourth element in the list, y is the fifth element in the list, z is the sixth element in the list, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, u is 0, c and d are empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
