Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: a list of unique integers in ascending order, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers. t is a positive integer.**

Explanation: The code defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list. The function is then called to read the first input, which is a positive integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. The remaining inputs in stdin are not affected by this code snippet.
