Output State: **t is 0, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least n+3 elements, w is the (n+1)th smallest float in a, x is the (n+2)th smallest float in a, y is the (n+3)th smallest float in a, z is the (n+4)th smallest float in a, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, u is 0, c is the first input from stdin, d is the second input from stdin.**

The first line decrements the value of `u` by 1, making it 0. The second line assigns the first input from stdin to `c` and the second input from stdin to `d`. No other variables are affected.
