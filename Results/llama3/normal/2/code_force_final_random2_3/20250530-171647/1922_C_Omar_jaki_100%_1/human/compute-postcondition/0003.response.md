To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and the list `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` has at least 4 elements, since we are using `zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: a list of unique integers in ascending order, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers.

So, for the loop to be executed, `a` must have at least 4 elements, and `w`, `x`, `y`, `z` must be the first four elements of `a`. 

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `a` is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least 4 elements, `w` is -1000000000.0, `x` is the second smallest float in `a`, `y` is the third smallest float in `a`, `z` is the fourth smallest float in `a`**
