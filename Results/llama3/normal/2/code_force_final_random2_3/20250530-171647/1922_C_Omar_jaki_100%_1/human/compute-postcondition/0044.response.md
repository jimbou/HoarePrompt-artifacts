Output State: **`t` is zero, `a` is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least n+3 elements, `w` is the (n+1)th smallest float in `a`, `x` is the (n+2)th smallest float in `a`, `y` is the (n+3)th smallest float in `a`, `z` is the (n+4)th smallest float in `a`, `v` is y - x, `b` is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, `u` is the first input from stdin, `c` and `d` are the last two inputs from stdin.**

In this output state, the value of `u` has been updated to be the first input from stdin, which was previously empty. The other variables remain unchanged.
