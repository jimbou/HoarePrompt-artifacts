Output: **t is False, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least n+3 elements, w is the (n+1)th smallest float in a, x is the (n+2)th smallest float in a, y is the (n+3)th smallest float in a, z is the (n+4)th smallest float in a, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, u is False, c and d are the last two inputs from stdin (excluding the one assigned to u), and the current value of c is less than the current value of d, and the difference between the (d-1)*2th element of b and the (c-1)*2th element of b is being printed**
