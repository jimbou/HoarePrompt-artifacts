Postcondition: **t is 0, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least n+3 elements, w is the (n+1)th smallest float in a, x is the (n+2)th smallest float in a, y is the (n+3)th smallest float in a, z is the (n+4)th smallest float in a, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, u is False, c and d are the first and second inputs from stdin respectively. If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*(d-1))th and (2*(c-1))th elements of b is being printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th and (2*d - 1)th elements of the modified list b is being printed.**
