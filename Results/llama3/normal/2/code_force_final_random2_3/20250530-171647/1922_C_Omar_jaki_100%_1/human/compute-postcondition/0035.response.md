The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be non-zero.
State: **t is non-zero, stdin is empty, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least n+3 elements, w is the (n-1)th smallest float in a, x is the nth smallest float in a, y is the (n+1)th smallest float in a, z is the (n+2)th smallest float in a, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, u is 0, c and d are the last two inputs from stdin. If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*d - 2)th element and the (2*c - 2)th element of b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of b is printed.**
