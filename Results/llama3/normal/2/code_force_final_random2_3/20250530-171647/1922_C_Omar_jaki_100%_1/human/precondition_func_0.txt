stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers. The first integer is a positive integer. The list of integers are non-negative and less than 10^9. The second integer is a positive integer and less than or equal to the length of the list of integers. The pairs of integers are positive integers and less than or equal to the length of the list of integers.
