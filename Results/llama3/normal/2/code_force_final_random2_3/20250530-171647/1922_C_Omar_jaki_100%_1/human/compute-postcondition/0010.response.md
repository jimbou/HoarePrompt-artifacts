Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `a` is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least `n+3` elements, `w` is the (`n-1`)th smallest float in `a`, `x` is the `n`th smallest float in `a`, `y` is the (`n+1`)th smallest float in `a`, `z` is the (`n+2`)th smallest float in `a`, `v` is `y - x`, `b` is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and `v` raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether `v` is greater than `x - w`, and its last element and `v` raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether `v` is greater than `z - y`, `u` is the next input from stdin**.

In this output state, the value of `u` is assigned the next input from stdin, which is one less than the initial number of test cases. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state, with `b` still modified by the sum of its second last element and `v` raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether `v` is greater than `x - w`, and its last element and `v` raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether `v` is greater than `z - y`.
