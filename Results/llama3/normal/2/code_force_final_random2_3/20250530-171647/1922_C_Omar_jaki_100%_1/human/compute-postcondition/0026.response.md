Postcondition: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains at least one more test case, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least n+3 elements, w is the (n-1)th smallest float in a, x is the nth smallest float in a, y is the (n+1)th smallest float in a, z is the (n+2)th smallest float in a, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, u is not empty and is the next input from stdin minus two, c and d are the next two inputs from stdin. If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*(d-1))th and (2*(c-1))th elements of b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of b and the (2*d - 1)th element of b is printed.**
