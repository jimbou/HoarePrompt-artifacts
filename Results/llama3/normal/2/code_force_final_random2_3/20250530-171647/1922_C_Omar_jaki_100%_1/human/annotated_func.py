#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers. The first integer is a positive integer. The list of integers are non-negative and less than 10^9. The second integer is a positive integer and less than or equal to the length of the list of integers. The pairs of integers are positive integers and less than or equal to the length of the list of integers.
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        r()
        
        a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
        
        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: t is 0, stdin is empty, a is a list of unique floats in ascending order that must have at least n+3 elements, w is the (n+1)th smallest float in a, x is the (n+2)th smallest float in a, y is the (n+3)th smallest float in a, z is the (n+4)th smallest float in a, v is y - x, b is modified by adding the sum of its second last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than x - w, and its last element and v raised to the power of a boolean value indicating whether v is greater than z - y, u is 0, c and d are the last two inputs from stdin. If c is less than d, the difference between the (2*d - 2)th element and the (2*c - 2)th element of b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element and the (2*d - 1)th element of b is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of four inputs: an integer, a list of unique integers in ascending order, another integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers. It then processes each test case by calculating and printing the differences between specific elements in a modified list, based on the input pairs. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point it terminates with an empty standard input.
