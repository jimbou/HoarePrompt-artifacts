Output State: **numCases is an integer between 2 and 4999, inclusive, i is 2, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a sorted list of numInteger integers, suma is 0**

In this output state, the value of numCases remains unchanged, as it was not modified by the code. The value of i also remains unchanged, as it was not modified by the code. The value of stdin is updated to reflect that one test case has been consumed by the code, leaving numCases - 3 test cases remaining. The value of numInteger is updated to reflect the new value read from stdin. The value of numbers is updated to reflect the new list of numInteger integers, which is sorted in ascending order. The value of suma is updated to reflect the new value of 0, which is the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list of numbers.
