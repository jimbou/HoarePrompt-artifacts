Output State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 1, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a sorted list of 2n integers, suma is 0**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code executes, and the initial state is modified as follows: `numInteger` is assigned the value of the next integer input from `stdin`, which is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. The `numbers` list is populated with the next `2n` integers from `stdin`, where `n` is the value of `numInteger`. The `numbers` list is then sorted in ascending order. The `suma` variable is initialized to 0. The `numCases` and `i` variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` now contains `numCases - 3` test cases.
