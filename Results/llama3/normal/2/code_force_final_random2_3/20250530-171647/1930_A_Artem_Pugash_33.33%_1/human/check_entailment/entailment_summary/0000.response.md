Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the correct number of test cases and integers for each test case.
2. It sorts the integers in ascending order, which is necessary to find the maximum final score.
3. It correctly pairs up the integers and calculates the sum of the minimum value in each pair.
4. The program prints the sum for each test case, which is the maximum final score that can be achieved.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score. The strategy is to always choose the smallest two numbers on the whiteboard, add the smaller one to the score, and erase both numbers. This ensures that the score is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
