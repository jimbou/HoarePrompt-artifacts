Output State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains numCases - 1 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a non-empty list of 2n - 2 integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7) in ascending order, suma is equal to the minimum of the first two integers in the original list numbers.**

In this output state, the value of `numCases` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains 0 as it is not modified. The `stdin` still contains `numCases - 1` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by `2n` integers. The value of `numInteger` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `numbers` now contains `2n - 2` integers, as two integers have been removed from the list. The value of `suma` is now equal to the minimum of the first two integers in the original list `numbers`.
