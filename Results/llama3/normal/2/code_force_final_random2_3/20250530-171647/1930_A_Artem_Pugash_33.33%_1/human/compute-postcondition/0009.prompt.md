Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains numCases - 1 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a list of 2n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7) in ascending order, suma is 0
Code of the loop:
while numbers != []:
    a = int(numbers.pop(0))
    b = int(numbers.pop(0))
    suma += min(a, b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains numCases - 1 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a non-empty list of 2n - 2 integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7) in ascending order, suma is equal to the minimum of the first two integers in the original list numbers.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains numCases - 1 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a non-empty list of 2n - 3 integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7) in ascending order, suma is equal to the minimum of the first two integers in the original list numbers plus the minimum of the first two integers that were removed from the list.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains numCases - 1 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a non-empty list of 2n - 4 integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7) in ascending order, suma is equal to the minimum of the first two integers in the original list numbers plus the minimum of the first two integers that were removed from the list plus the minimum of the next two integers that were removed from the list.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
