Output State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains numCases - 1 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is an empty list, suma is equal to the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list numbers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `numbers` is empty, and the variable `suma` contains the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list `numbers`. The other variables remain unchanged.
