The only variable in the loop head is variable numbers, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable numbers. If numbers is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, numbers is a sorted list of 2n integers, which means it is not empty. Therefore, no adjustment is needed.

State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 1, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a sorted list of 2n integers, suma is 0**
