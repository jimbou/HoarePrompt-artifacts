Output State: **numCases is 0, i is numCases, stdin contains 0 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is an empty list, suma is the sum of the minimum of all pairs of adjacent elements in the original numbers list, and the sum of the minimum of all pairs of adjacent elements in the original numbers list which is suma is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the number of test cases (`numCases`) has been reduced to 0, the loop counter (`i`) has reached the initial value of `numCases`, there are no more test cases in the standard input (`stdin`), the last read integer (`numInteger`) is still an integer between 1 and 50, the list of numbers (`numbers`) is empty, the sum of the minimum of all pairs of adjacent elements in the original list of numbers (`suma`) has been calculated and printed.
