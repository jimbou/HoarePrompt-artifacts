To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `numCases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `numCases`. If `numCases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `numCases` is already an integer between 1 and 5000, inclusive, we don't need to adjust its value. However, we do need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure the loop can start.

At the beginning of the loop, `i` should be 0, so that the loop can execute `numCases` times.

State: **`numCases` is an integer between 1 and 5000, inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains `numCases` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 <= a_i <= 10^7)**
