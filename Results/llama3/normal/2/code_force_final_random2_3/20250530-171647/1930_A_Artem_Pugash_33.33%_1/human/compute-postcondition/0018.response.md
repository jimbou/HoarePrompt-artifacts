According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable numbers. If numbers is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, numbers is a sorted list of at least 1 integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time, numbers must have at least one integer left. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 1, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 48, inclusive, numbers is a sorted list of at least 2 integers, a is an integer, b is an integer, suma is equal to the minimum of the first three integers in the original list of numbers.**
