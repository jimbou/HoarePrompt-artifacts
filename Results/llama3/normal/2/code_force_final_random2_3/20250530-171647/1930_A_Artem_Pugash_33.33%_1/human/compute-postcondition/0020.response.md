Output State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 1, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is an empty list, suma is equal to the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list of numbers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list of numbers is empty, and the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list of numbers is stored in the variable suma. The other variables, numCases, i, stdin, and numInteger, remain unchanged.
