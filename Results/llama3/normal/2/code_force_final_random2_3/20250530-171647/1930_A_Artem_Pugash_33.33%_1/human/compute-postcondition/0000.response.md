The code `numCases = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `numCases`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by `t` test cases, the value of `numCases` will be equal to `t`.

The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, inclusive. Therefore, the output state is: `numCases` is an integer between 1 and 5000, inclusive, and the standard input contains `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).

Output State: **`numCases` is an integer between 1 and 5000, inclusive, stdin contains `numCases` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 <= a_i <= 10^7)**
