Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the `2n` integers themselves.
3. It sorts the integers in ascending order, which is a crucial step in finding the maximum final score.
4. It then pairs up the sorted integers and calculates the sum of the minimum value in each pair. This is done by popping the first two elements from the sorted list, converting them to integers, and adding the minimum of the two to the sum `suma`.
5. Finally, it prints the sum `suma` for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy to find the maximum final score by pairing up the smallest integers and adding their minimum values to the sum.

Correctness: **True**
