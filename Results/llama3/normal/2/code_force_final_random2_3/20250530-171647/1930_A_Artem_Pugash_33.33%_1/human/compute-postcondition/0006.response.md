Output State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains numCases - 1 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a non-empty list of 2n - 3 integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7) in ascending order, suma is equal to the minimum of the first two integers in the original list numbers plus the minimum of the first two integers that were removed from the list.**

In this final state, the value of `numCases` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The contents of `stdin` remain the same as the code does not read from `stdin`. The value of `numInteger` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `numbers` is modified by removing the first two integers, and its length is reduced by 2. The value of `suma` is updated by adding the minimum of the first two integers that were removed from the list `numbers`.
