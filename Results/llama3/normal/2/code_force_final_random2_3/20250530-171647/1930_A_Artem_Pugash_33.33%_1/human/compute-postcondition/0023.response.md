To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and `numCases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `numCases`. If `i` is less than `numCases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `numCases` is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `numCases` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `numCases` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`numCases` is an integer between 2 and 4999, inclusive, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `numCases - 2` test cases, `numInteger` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is equal to the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list of numbers**
