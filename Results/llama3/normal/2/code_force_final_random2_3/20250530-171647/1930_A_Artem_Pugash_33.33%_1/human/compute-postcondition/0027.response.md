The only variable in the loop head is variable numbers, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable numbers.  If numbers is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, numbers is a sorted list of numInteger - 2 integers, So for the loop to be executed one more time numbers needed to have had at least one more integer and currently must not be empty.
State: **numCases is an integer between 2 and 4999, inclusive, i is 2, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a sorted list of numInteger - 2 integers and numbers is not empty, suma is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of the original numbers list, a is the first element of the original numbers list, b is the second element of the original numbers list.**
