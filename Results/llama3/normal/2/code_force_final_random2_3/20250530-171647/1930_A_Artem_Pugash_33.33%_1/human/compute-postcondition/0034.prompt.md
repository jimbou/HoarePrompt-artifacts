Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numCases` is an integer between 1 and 5000, inclusive, stdin contains `numCases` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 <= a_i <= 10^7)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(numCases):
    numInteger = int(input())
    numbers = input().split()
    numbers.sort(reverse=False)
    suma = 0
    while numbers != []:
        a = int(numbers.pop(0))
        b = int(numbers.pop(0))
        suma += min(a, b)
    print(suma)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains numCases - 1 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is an empty list, suma is equal to the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list numbers, and the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list numbers is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 1, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is an empty list, suma is equal to the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list of numbers, and the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list of numbers which is suma is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: numCases is an integer between 2 and 4999, inclusive, i is 2, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is an empty list, suma is the sum of the minimum of all pairs of adjacent elements in the original numbers list, and the sum of the minimum of all pairs of adjacent elements in the original numbers list which is suma is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
