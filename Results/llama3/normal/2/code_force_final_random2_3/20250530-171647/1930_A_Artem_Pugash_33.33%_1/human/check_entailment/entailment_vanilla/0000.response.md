Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves, where each move involves choosing two integers x and y from the whiteboard, adding min(x, y) to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of integers (2n) and the 2n integers themselves.

3. The program sorts the integers in ascending order using the `sort()` function with the `reverse=False` argument, which is correct because we want to pair the smallest integers together to maximize the score.

4. The program then enters a while loop that continues until all integers have been processed (i.e., until the `numbers` list is empty).

5. Inside the loop, the program pops the first two integers from the sorted list, converts them to integers using `int()`, and adds the minimum of the two integers to the `suma` variable.

6. After processing all integers, the program prints the final score, which is the maximum final score that can be achieved.

7. The program correctly handles multiple test cases and produces the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
