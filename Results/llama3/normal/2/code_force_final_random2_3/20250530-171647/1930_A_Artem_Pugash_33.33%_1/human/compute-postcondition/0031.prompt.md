Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: numCases is an integer between 2 and 4999, inclusive, i is 2, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a sorted list of numInteger integers, suma is 0
Code of the loop:
while numbers != []:
    a = int(numbers.pop(0))
    b = int(numbers.pop(0))
    suma += min(a, b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: numCases is an integer between 2 and 4999, inclusive, i is 2, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a sorted list of numInteger - 2 integers, suma is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of the original numbers list, a is the first element of the original numbers list, b is the second element of the original numbers list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: numCases is an integer between 2 and 4999, inclusive, i is 2, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a sorted list of numInteger - 2 integers, suma is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of the original numbers list plus the minimum of a and b, a is the first element of the original numbers list, b is the second element of the original numbers list.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: numCases is an integer between 2 and 4999, inclusive, i is 2, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 3 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a sorted list of numInteger - 4 integers, suma is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of the original numbers list plus the minimum of a and b plus the minimum of the first two elements of the updated numbers list, a is the first element of the updated numbers list, b is the second element of the updated numbers list.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
