Output State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains numCases - 1 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a non-empty list of 2n - 4 integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7) in ascending order, suma is equal to the minimum of the first two integers in the original list numbers plus the minimum of the first two integers that were removed from the list plus the minimum of the next two integers that were removed from the list.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows: The first line removes the first integer from the list numbers and assigns it to a. The second line removes the second integer from the list numbers and assigns it to b. The third line increments suma by the minimum of a and b. The list numbers is now two integers shorter, and suma has been incremented by the minimum of the two removed integers.
