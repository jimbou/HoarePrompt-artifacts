Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order, pairs them up, and calculates the sum of the minimum value in each pair. The function then prints the sum for each test case. The function does not return any value, but rather prints the results directly to the console.**
