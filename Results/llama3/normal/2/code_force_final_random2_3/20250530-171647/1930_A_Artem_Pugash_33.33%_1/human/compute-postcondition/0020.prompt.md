Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 1, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a sorted list of 2n integers, suma is 0
Code of the loop:
while numbers != []:
    a = int(numbers.pop(0))
    b = int(numbers.pop(0))
    suma += min(a, b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 1, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a sorted list of 2n - 2 integers, suma is equal to the minimum of the first two integers in the original list of numbers.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 1, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 48, inclusive, numbers is a sorted list of at least 1 integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, suma is equal to the minimum of the first three integers in the original list of numbers.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 1, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 46, inclusive, numbers is a sorted list of at least 2 integers, a is an integer equal to the first integer in the original list of numbers, b is an integer equal to the second integer in the original list of numbers, suma is equal to the minimum of the first five integers in the original list of numbers.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
