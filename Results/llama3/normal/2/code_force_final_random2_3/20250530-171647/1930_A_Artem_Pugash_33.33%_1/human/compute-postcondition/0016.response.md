The variable in the loop head is variable numbers, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable numbers.  If numbers is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, numbers is a sorted list of 2n - 2 integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time numbers currently must be a sorted list of at least 1 integer.
State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 1, stdin contains numCases - 3 test cases, numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a sorted list of at least 1 integer, suma is equal to the minimum of the first two integers in the original list of numbers.**
