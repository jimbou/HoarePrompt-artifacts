The only variable in the loop head is variable numbers, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable numbers.  If numbers is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, numbers is a non-empty list of 2n - 3 integers, So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least one more element.
State: **numCases is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains numCases - 1 test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7), numInteger is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, numbers is a non-empty list of 2n - 2 integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^7) in ascending order, suma is equal to the minimum of the first two integers in the original list numbers plus the minimum of the first two integers that were removed from the list.**
