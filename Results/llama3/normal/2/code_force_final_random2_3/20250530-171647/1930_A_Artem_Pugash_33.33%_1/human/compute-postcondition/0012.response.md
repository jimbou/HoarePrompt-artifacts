To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(numCases):`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `numCases`. If `i` is less than `numCases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `numCases` is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `numCases` remains the same.

State: **`numCases` is an integer between 1 and 4999, inclusive, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `numCases - 2` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50) followed by `2n` integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7), `numInteger` is an integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is equal to the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list `numbers`, and the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers in the original list `numbers` is printed**
