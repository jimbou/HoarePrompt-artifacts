This function determines the winner of a game based on the total number of digits in a list of integers and the count of zeros in those integers. It takes three inputs: a positive integer n, a non-negative integer m, and a list of n positive integers. The function calculates the total number of digits in all integers, subtracts the sum of the counts of zeros in the integers with the most zeros, the third most zeros, the fifth most zeros, and so on, and compares the result to m + 1. If the result is greater than or equal to m + 1, the function returns 'Sasha', indicating Sasha wins. Otherwise, it returns 'Anna', indicating Anna wins.
