To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`, which means the loop will iterate from `len(num) - 1` down to `-1` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(num) - 2`.

The other variables in the loop head are `num`, which is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value with at least 2 characters, and `tot`, which is 1. Since `num` and `tot` are not modified by the loop head, their values remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value with at least 2 characters, `tot` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 2`**
