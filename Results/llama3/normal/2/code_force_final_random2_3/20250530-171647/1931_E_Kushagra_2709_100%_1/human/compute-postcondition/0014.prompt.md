Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: num is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value, tot is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
    if num[i] != '0':
        break
    tot += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value with at least 2 characters, `tot` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 1`. If the current value of `num[i]` is not '0', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value with at least 2 characters, `tot` is 2, `i` is `len(num) - 2`. If the character at index `i` in `num` is not '0', the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value with at least 2 characters, `tot` is 3, `i` is `len(num) - 3. If the character at index `i` in `num` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
