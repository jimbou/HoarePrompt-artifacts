The code increments the value of `tot` by 1. The initial value of `tot` is 2, so after the increment, `tot` becomes 3. The other variables, `num` and `i`, are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value with at least 2 characters, `tot` is 3, `i` is `len(num) - 3. If the character at index `i` in `num` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
