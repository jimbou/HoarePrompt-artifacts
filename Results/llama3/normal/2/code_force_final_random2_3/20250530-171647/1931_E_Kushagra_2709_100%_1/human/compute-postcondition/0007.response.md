Output State: **`num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value with at least 2 characters, `tot` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `num`, `tot`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `break` statement only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is directly inside, without affecting the values of the variables.
