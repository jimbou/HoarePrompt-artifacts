To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `num` has at least 2 characters (since the range starts from `len(num) - 1` and goes down to `-1`). If `num` has only 1 character or is an empty string, the loop will not execute.

So, we need to adjust the state of `num` to ensure it has at least 2 characters.

State: **`num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value with at least 2 characters, `tot` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
