Output State: **`num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value with at least 2 characters, `tot` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `num[i]` is not '0'.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `num`, `tot`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement, but does not affect the values of the variables. The condition that `num[i]` is not '0' is still valid, as the `break` statement does not change the value of `num[i]`.
