Output State: **num is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value, tot is 0**

The code converts the non-negative integer `num` to its string representation and assigns it back to `num`. The second line initializes a new variable `tot` to 0. The original value of `num` is not affected, but its type is changed from an integer to a string. The variable `tot` is introduced with a value of 0.
