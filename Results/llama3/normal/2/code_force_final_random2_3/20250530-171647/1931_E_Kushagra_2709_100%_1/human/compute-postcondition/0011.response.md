Output State: **`num` is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value with at least 2 characters, `tot` is 2, `i` is `len(num) - 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `num`, `tot`, and `i` remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not affect their values. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
