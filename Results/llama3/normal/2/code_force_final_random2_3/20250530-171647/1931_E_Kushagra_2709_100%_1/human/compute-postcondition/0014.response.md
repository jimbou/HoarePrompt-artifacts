Output State: **num is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value, tot is the number of trailing zeros in num, i is -1**.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `num` remains unchanged, `tot` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in `num`, and `i` is -1.
