Output State: **`ap` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `ap` inputs: each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), `k` is `ap` - 1, `x` and `y` are integers that are input by the user from stdin. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2, `x` is `y` times 4 minus `bxsfory` times 15, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of `x` divided by 15, and `bxsfory1` + `bxsfory` is printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` equals 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, the number 0 is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed `ap` times, where `ap` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The loop has processed `ap` pairs of integers `x` and `y` from stdin, where each pair contains two space-separated integers between 0 and 99. The loop has updated the values of `x` and `y` according to the conditions specified in the loop body, and has printed the results accordingly. The final values of `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers processed by the loop, and the final output is the result of the last iteration of the loop.
