Output: **ap is at least 2, k is 1, bxsfory is the ceiling of y divided by 2, x is y times 4 minus bxsfory times 15, bxsfory1 is 0 if x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of x divided by 15, y is an integer, stdin is empty, and this is printed: bxsfory1 + bxsfory, where bxsfory1 is 0 if x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of x divided by 15, and bxsfory is the ceiling of y divided by 2**
