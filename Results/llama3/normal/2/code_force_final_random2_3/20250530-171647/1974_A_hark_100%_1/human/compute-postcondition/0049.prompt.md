Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ap` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `ap` inputs: each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)
Code of the loop:
for k in range(ap):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ap` is at least 1, `k` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers. If both `x` and `y` are positive, `x` is updated to its original value minus the ceiling of `y/2` times 15 plus `y` times 4, and the sum of the ceiling of `x/15` (if `x` is positive) and the ceiling of `y/2` is printed. If either `x` or `y` is not positive, then either the ceiling of `x/15` (if `x` is positive), the ceiling of `y/2` (if `y` is positive), or 0 (if both `x` and `y` are not positive) is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ap` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers that are input by the user from stdin. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2, `x` is `y` times 4 minus `bxsfory` times 15, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of `x` divided by 15, and `bxsfory1` + `bxsfory` is printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` equals 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, the number 0 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ap` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers that are input by the user from stdin. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2, `x` is `y` times 4 minus `bxsfory` times 15, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of `x` divided by 15, and `bxsfory1` + `bxsfory` is printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` equals 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, the number 0 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
