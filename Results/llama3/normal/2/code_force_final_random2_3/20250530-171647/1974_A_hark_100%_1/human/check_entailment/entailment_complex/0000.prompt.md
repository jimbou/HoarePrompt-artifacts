Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
import math

func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t+1 inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and then t lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: `ap` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `ap` inputs: each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), `k` is `ap` - 1, `x` and `y` are integers that are input by the user from stdin. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2, `x` is `y` times 4 minus `bxsfory` times 15, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of `x` divided by 15, and `bxsfory1` + `bxsfory` is printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` equals 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, the number 0 is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of input pairs from the standard input, where each pair consists of two integers x and y. It then performs calculations based on the values of x and y, and prints the results. If both x and y are positive, it calculates the ceiling of y divided by 2, subtracts this value multiplied by 15 from x, adds y multiplied by 4, and prints the sum of the ceiling of the result divided by 15 and the ceiling of y divided by 2. If x is 0 and y is positive, it prints the ceiling of y divided by 2. If x is positive and y is 0, it prints the ceiling of x divided by 15. If both x and y are 0, it prints 0. The function repeats this process for a number of input pairs specified by the first input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
