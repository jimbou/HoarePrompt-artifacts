Output: **`ap` is at least 1, `k` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers. Either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. The current value of `x` is greater than 0 and the current value of `y` is 0, and the ceiling of the division of the current value of `x` by 15 is being printed**
