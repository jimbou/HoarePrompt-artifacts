Output State: **`ap` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `ap` inputs: each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

In this output state, the value of `ap` is assigned the integer value from the first input in stdin, which is between 1 and 10^4. The remaining `ap` inputs in stdin are still valid, each containing two space-separated integers x and y, where x and y are between 0 and 99.
