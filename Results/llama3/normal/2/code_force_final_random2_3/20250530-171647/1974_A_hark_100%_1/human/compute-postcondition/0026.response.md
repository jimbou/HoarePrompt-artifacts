The `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of the division of `y` by 2.
Since `y` is an integer input by the user from stdin, its exact value is not known. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the ceiling of half of the value of `y`.
Output: **the ceiling of half of the value of y (where y is the integer input by the user from stdin)**
