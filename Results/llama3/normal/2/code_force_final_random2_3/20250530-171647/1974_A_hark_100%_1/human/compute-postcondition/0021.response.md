The only variable in the loop head is `k` and `ap`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `ap`. If `k` is less than `ap`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, `ap` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1, so `k` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `ap` must be greater than 1.
State: **`ap` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers.**
