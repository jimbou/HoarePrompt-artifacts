Postcondition: **`ap` is at least 1, `k` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers. If both `x` and `y` are positive, `x` is updated to its original value minus the ceiling of `y/2` times 15 plus `y` times 4, and the sum of the ceiling of `x/15` (if `x` is positive) and the ceiling of `y/2` is printed. If either `x` or `y` is not positive, then either the ceiling of `x/15` (if `x` is positive), the ceiling of `y/2` (if `y` is positive), or 0 (if both `x` and `y` are not positive) is printed.**
