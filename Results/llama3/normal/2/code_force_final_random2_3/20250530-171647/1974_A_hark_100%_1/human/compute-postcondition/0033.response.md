Postcondition: ***`ap` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers that are input by the user from stdin. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` equals 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, the number 0 is printed.***
