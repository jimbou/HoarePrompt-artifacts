Output State: **ap is at least 2, k is 2, x is y times 4 minus bxsfory times 15, bxsfory is the ceiling of y divided by 2, bxsfory1 is 0 if x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of x divided by 15, stdin is empty**

Here is the explanation of the output state in natural language:

The value of `ap` remains at least 2, and `k` remains 2, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `x` is updated based on the values of `y` and `bxsfory`, which is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2. The value of `bxsfory1` is determined by the value of `x` after the update, and it is either 0 or the ceiling of `x` divided by 15, depending on whether `x` is less than or equal to 0. The code does not modify the values of `ap` and `k`, and the stdin is empty after the code execution.
