Based on the precondition, we know that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0. We also know that `x` and `y` are integers.

The `print` statement is printing the result of `math.ceil(x / 15)`. The `math.ceil` function returns the smallest integer not less than the given number.

Since `x` is greater than 0, `x / 15` will be a positive number. The `math.ceil` function will round this number up to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the output will be the smallest integer not less than `x / 15`.

Output: **the smallest integer not less than x / 15 (where x is the current value of x)**
