To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

1.  **Initial State:**

    *   `ap` is at least 1.
    *   `k` is 0.
    *   `y` is a positive integer.
    *   `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus the ceiling of `y/2` times 15 plus `y` times 4.
    *   `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y/2`.
    *   `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the ceiling of `x/15`.

2.  **Code Snippet:**

    ```
print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
```

3.  **Step-by-Step Analysis:**

    *   `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y/2`. Since `y` is a positive integer, `bxsfory` will be an integer value representing the ceiling of half of `y`.
    *   `bxsfory1` depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` will be 0. Otherwise, it will be the ceiling of `x/15`.
    *   The expression `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus the ceiling of `y/2` times 15 plus `y` times 4. This means `x` is adjusted based on `y`, but without knowing the original value of `x`, we can't determine its exact value. However, we know it's an integer.
    *   The `print` statement adds `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory` together. Since both are integers (with `bxsfory1` being either 0 or the ceiling of `x/15`), the result will be an integer.

4.  **Output:**

    The output will be the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`. Since `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y/2` and `bxsfory1` is either 0 or the ceiling of `x/15` (depending on the value of `x`), the output will be an integer representing this sum.

    **Output: bxsfory1 (which is either 0 or the ceiling of x/15) + bxsfory (which is the ceiling of y/2)**
