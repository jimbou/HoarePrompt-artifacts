To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ap` is at least 2.
   - `k` is 2.
   - `x` is `y` times 4 minus `bxsfory` times 15.
   - `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2.
   - `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of `x` divided by 15.
   - `stdin` is empty.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
```

Given the initial state, we need to determine the values of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory` to understand what will be printed.

- **bxsfory**: This is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2. Without the exact value of `y`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `bxsfory`. However, we know it's the ceiling of `y/2`.

- **bxsfory1**: This depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` is 0. Otherwise, it's the ceiling of `x` divided by 15.

- **x**: This is `y` times 4 minus `bxsfory` times 15. Without the exact values of `y` and `bxsfory`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `x`. However, we know its formula.

Since we don't have explicit values for `y`, `x`, `bxsfory`, and `bxsfory1`, we can't compute their exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe what will be printed:

- If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` will be 0, and the print statement will output the value of `bxsfory`.
- If `x` is greater than 0, `bxsfory1` will be the ceiling of `x` divided by 15, and the print statement will output the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`.

Given the lack of explicit values for `y` and the dependency of `x` and `bxsfory1` on `y`, we can't provide a more precise numerical answer.

**Output: **bxsfory1 (which is either 0 if x is less than or equal to 0, or the ceiling of x divided by 15 if x is greater than 0) + bxsfory (which is the ceiling of y divided by 2)**
