Output: **`ap` is at least 1, `k` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers. The current value of `x` is 0 and the current value of `y` is greater than 0. Either the previous value of `x` was less than or equal to 0 or the previous value of `y` was less than or equal to 0, and the ceiling of half of the current value of `y` is being printed**
