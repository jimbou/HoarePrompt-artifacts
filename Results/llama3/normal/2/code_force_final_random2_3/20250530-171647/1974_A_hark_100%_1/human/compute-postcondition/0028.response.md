The code prints the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15.
Since `x` is an integer that is input by the user from stdin, its value is not known beforehand.
However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the result of the division of `x` by 15.
Output: **the ceiling of the division of x by 15 (where x is the integer input by the user from stdin)**
