This function reads a series of input pairs from the standard input, where each pair consists of two integers x and y. It then performs calculations based on the values of x and y, and prints the results. If both x and y are positive, it calculates the ceiling of y divided by 2, subtracts this value multiplied by 15 from x, adds y multiplied by 4, and prints the sum of the ceiling of the result divided by 15 and the ceiling of y divided by 2. If x is 0 and y is positive, it prints the ceiling of y divided by 2. If x is positive and y is 0, it prints the ceiling of x divided by 15. If both x and y are 0, it prints 0. The function repeats this process for a number of input pairs specified by the first input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
