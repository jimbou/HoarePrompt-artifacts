To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `k` and `ap`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `ap`. If `ap` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ap` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ap` to be at least 1, and `k` should be initialized to 0, as it will be the first iteration.

State: **`ap` is at least 1, `k` is 0**
