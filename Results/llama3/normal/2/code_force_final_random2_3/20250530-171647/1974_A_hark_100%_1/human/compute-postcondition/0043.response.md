Output: ** `ap` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers that are input by the user from stdin. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2, `x` is `y` times 4 minus `bxsfory` times 15, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise it is the ceiling of `x` divided by 15, and `bxsfory1` + `bxsfory` is printed. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` equals 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, the number 0 is printed. , and the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed**
