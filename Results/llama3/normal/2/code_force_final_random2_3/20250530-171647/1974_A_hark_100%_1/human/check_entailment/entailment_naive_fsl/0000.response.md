Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. 

For example, when x = 7 and y = 2, the program calculates bxsfory as 1 (math.ceil(2 / 2)) and then subtracts 15 from x (7 - 15 = -8), which is incorrect because it's not possible to subtract more icons than exist. The correct approach would be to first place the 2x2 icons and then place the 1x1 icons in the remaining space.

A correct solution would be to calculate the total space needed for the 2x2 icons (4 * y) and the 1x1 icons (x), and then divide this total by the total space available on a screen (15). The result would be the minimum number of screens needed.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        total_space_needed = 4 * y + x
        min_screens_needed = math.ceil(total_space_needed / 15)
        print(min_screens_needed)

func_1()
```
