The code prints the sum of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`. Where `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the ceiling of `x/15`, and `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y/2`. Here, `x` is an integer equal to its original value minus the ceiling of `y/2` times 15 plus `y` times 4, and `y` is a positive integer.
Output: **ap is at least 1, k is 0, y is a positive integer, x is an integer equal to its original value minus the ceiling of y/2 times 15 plus y times 4, bxsfory is the ceiling of y/2, bxsfory1 is 0 if x is less than or equal to 0, otherwise the ceiling of x/15, and the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is printed**
