Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, each tuple contains three integers n, m, and k, and two lists a and b of integers, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even, 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6 for all i and j, results is an empty list, unique_a is a set of unique integers from list a, unique_b is a set of unique integers from list b, relevant_a is a set of integers from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set of integers from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set of integers that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set of integers that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, and both is a set of integers that are in both relevant_a and relevant_b.**
