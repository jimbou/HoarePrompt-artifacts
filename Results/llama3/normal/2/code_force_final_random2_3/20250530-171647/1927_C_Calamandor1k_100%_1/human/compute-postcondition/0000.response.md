Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` of integers, such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2*10^5, 2 <= `k` <= 2*min(`n`, `m`), `k` is even, 1 <= `a_i`, `b_j` <= 10^6 for all `i` and `j`, and `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer, and the `cases` list remains unchanged with its tuples containing three integers and two lists of integers within the specified ranges. A new variable `results` is introduced, which is an empty list.
