Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, cases is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, each tuple contains three integers n, m, and k, and two lists a and b of integers, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even, 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6 for all i and j, unique_a is a set of unique elements from list a, unique_b is a set of unique elements from list b, relevant_a is a set of elements from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set of elements from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set of elements that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set of elements that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, both is a set of elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, total_distinct is the sum of the number of elements in only_a, only_b, and both, and results is a list containing the string 'YES' and possibly the string 'NO' if the number of elements in only_a is more than half of k or the number of elements in only_b is more than half of k, or if total_distinct is less than k. If the number of elements in only_b is more than half of k, the results list contains the string 'YES' and 'NO'. Otherwise, the results list only contains the string 'YES'.***
