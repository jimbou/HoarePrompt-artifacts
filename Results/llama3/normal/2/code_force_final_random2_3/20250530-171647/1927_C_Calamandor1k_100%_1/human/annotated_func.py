#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, cases is a list of tuples, each tuple contains three integers n, m, and k, and two lists a and b of integers, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even, 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6 for all i and j.

    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is an empty list, `unique_a` and `unique_b` are empty sets, `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are empty sets, `only_a` and `only_b` are empty sets, `both` is an empty set, `total_distinct` is 0, and `results` is a list containing 'YES' and possibly 'NO' for each tuple in the original `cases` list.
    return results
    #The program returns a list containing 'YES' and possibly 'NO' for each tuple in the original `cases` list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function evaluates a list of cases, where each case contains parameters n, m, k, and two lists a and b. It determines whether it's possible to select k distinct elements from the union of a and b, with at most k/2 elements coming from each list. The function returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' for each case, indicating whether the selection is possible or not.
