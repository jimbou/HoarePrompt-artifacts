Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is an empty list, `unique_a` and `unique_b` are empty sets, `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are empty sets, `only_a` and `only_b` are empty sets, `both` is an empty set, `total_distinct` is 0, and `results` is a list containing 'YES' and possibly 'NO' for each tuple in the original `cases` list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list of cases is empty, all the sets used to process the cases are empty, and the total distinct count is 0. The results list contains 'YES' for each case where the number of elements in `only_a` and `only_b` is not more than half of `k` and the total distinct count is greater than or equal to `k`, and 'NO' otherwise.
