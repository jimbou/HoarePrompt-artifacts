Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it's possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first creates a set of unique elements from each array (a and b) that are less than or equal to k. This is done to remove duplicates and to only consider elements that are relevant to the problem.

2. It then calculates the number of elements that are only in array a, only in array b, and in both arrays. This is done to determine the maximum number of elements that can be chosen from each array.

3. If the number of elements that are only in array a or only in array b is more than k/2, it immediately returns 'NO' because it's not possible to choose k/2 elements from each array.

4. If the total number of distinct elements (only in a, only in b, and in both) is less than k, it also returns 'NO' because it's not possible to choose k distinct elements.

5. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'YES' because it's possible to choose k/2 elements from each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included.

Correctness: **True**
