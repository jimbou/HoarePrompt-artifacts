Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, each tuple contains three integers n, m, and k, and two lists a and b of integers, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even, 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6 for all i and j, unique_a is a set of unique elements from list a, unique_b is a set of unique elements from list b, relevant_a is a set of elements from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set of elements from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set of elements that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set of elements that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, both is a set of elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, total_distinct is the sum of the number of elements in only_a, only_b, and both, and results is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO' if the number of elements in only_a is more than half of k or the number of elements in only_b is more than half of k, or if total_distinct is less than k. If the number of elements in only_b is more than half of k, the results list contains the strings 'YES' and 'NO'. Otherwise, the results list only contains the string 'YES'.**

The code snippet appends the string 'NO' to the results list and then continues to the next iteration of the loop. This means that the results list will now contain the string 'NO' in addition to any other strings it may have contained previously. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
