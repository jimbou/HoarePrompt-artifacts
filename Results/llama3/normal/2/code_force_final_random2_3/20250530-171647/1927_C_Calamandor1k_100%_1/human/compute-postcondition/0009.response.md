Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, each tuple contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` of integers, such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2*10^5, 2 <= `k` <= 2*min(`n`, `m`), `k` is even, 1 <= `a_i`, `b_j` <= 10^6 for all `i` and `j`, `unique_a` is a set of unique integers from list `a`, `unique_b` is a set of unique integers from list `b`, `relevant_a` is a set of integers from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set of integers from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set of integers that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set of integers that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set of integers that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the sizes of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, and if the number of elements in `only_b` is more than `k // 2`, `results` is a list containing 'NO', otherwise `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `total_distinct` which is the sum of the sizes of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
