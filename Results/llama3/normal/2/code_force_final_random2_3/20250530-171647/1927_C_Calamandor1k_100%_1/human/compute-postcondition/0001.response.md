To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` within the `cases` list. The loop will execute if `cases` is not empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `cases` to ensure it has at least one tuple that meets the given constraints.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, each tuple contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` of integers, such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2*10^5, 2 <= `k` <= 2*min(`n`, `m`), `k` is even, 1 <= `a_i`, `b_j` <= 10^6 for all `i` and `j`, and `results` is an empty list**
