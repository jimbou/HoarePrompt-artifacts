To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `(n, m, k, a, b)` and the list `cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cases`. If the list has at least one more tuple, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `cases` has at least one tuple, and we have processed the first tuple.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cases` must have at least one more tuple. The state of the other variables (`t`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `both`, `total_distinct`, and `results`) does not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, each tuple contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` of integers, such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2*10^5, 2 <= `k` <= 2*min(`n`, `m`), `k` is even, 1 <= `a_i`, `b_j` <= 10^6 for all `i` and `j`, `unique_a` is an empty set, `unique_b` is an empty set, `relevant_a` is an empty set, `relevant_b` is an empty set, `only_a` is an empty set, `only_b` is an empty set, `both` is an empty set, `total_distinct` is 0, and `results` is an empty list**
