Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, each tuple contains three integers n, m, and k, and two lists a and b of integers, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even, 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6 for all i and j, unique_a is a set of unique elements from list a, unique_b is a set of unique elements from list b, relevant_a is a set of elements from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set of elements from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set of elements that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set of elements that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, both is a set of elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, total_distinct is 0, and results is an empty list.**

The code snippet processes the lists `a` and `b` from the `cases` tuple, creating sets of unique elements (`unique_a` and `unique_b`), and then filters these sets to include only elements less than or equal to `k` (`relevant_a` and `relevant_b`). It then calculates the differences between these sets to find elements that are only in `a` (`only_a`), only in `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`). The `total_distinct` variable remains unchanged at 0, and the `results` list remains empty.
