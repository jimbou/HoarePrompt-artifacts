This function evaluates a list of cases, where each case contains parameters n, m, k, and two lists a and b. It determines whether it's possible to select k distinct elements from the union of a and b, with at most k/2 elements coming from each list. The function returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' for each case, indicating whether the selection is possible or not.
