Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, each tuple contains three integers n, m, and k, and two lists a and b of integers, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even, 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6 for all i and j, unique_a is a set of unique elements from list a, unique_b is a set of unique elements from list b, relevant_a is a set of elements from unique_a that are less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set of elements from unique_b that are less than or equal to k, only_a is a set of elements that are in relevant_a but not in relevant_b, only_b is a set of elements that are in relevant_b but not in relevant_a, both is a set of elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, total_distinct is 0, and results is a list containing the string 'NO'.**

The code snippet appends the string 'NO' to the results list and then continues to the next iteration of the loop. This means that the rest of the variables remain unchanged, and only the results list is modified by adding the string 'NO' to it.
