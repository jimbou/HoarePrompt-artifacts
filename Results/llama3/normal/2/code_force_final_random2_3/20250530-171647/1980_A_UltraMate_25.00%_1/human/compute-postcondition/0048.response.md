Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is another key in the dictionary `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the difference between `m` and the count of character `i` in string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now dependent on the value of `m` and the count of character `i` in string `s`.
