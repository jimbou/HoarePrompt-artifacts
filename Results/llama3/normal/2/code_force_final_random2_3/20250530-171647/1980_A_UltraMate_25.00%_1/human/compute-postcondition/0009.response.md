Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is 1. If `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is an integer between `m` and 5. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
