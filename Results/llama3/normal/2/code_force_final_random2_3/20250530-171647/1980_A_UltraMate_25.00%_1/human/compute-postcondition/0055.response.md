The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and string `p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `p`. If `p` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `p` is 'ABCDEF', which ensures that the loop will execute. So `p` needs to be adjusted to a string that has at least 1 character and `i` is now the first character in the string `p`.
