Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and must have at least 1 key-value pair, `i` is the first key in the dictionary `hmp`. If the count of the first character in the dictionary `hmp` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.***
