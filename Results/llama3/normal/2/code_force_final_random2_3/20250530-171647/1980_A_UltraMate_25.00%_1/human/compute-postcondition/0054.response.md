Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s, i is the last key in the dictionary hmp, ans is 0**

The code block reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. It then reads a string of `n` characters from stdin and assigns it to `s`. The string `p` is assigned the value 'ABCDEF'. A dictionary `hmp` is created using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, which counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The variable `i` is not explicitly assigned a value in the code snippet, but based on the initial state, it is the last key in the dictionary `hmp`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Stdin now contains t-5 test cases.
