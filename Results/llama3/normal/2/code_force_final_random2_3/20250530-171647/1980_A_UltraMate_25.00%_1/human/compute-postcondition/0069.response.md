Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least one character, `p` is a string that has 6 characters, `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` that must have at least one key, `i` is the first key in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the difference between `m` and the count of the first character `i` in string `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` remain the same. The stdin still contains `t-5` test cases. The dictionary `hmp` still has at least one key, and `i` is still the first key in `hmp`.
