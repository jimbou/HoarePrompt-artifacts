Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is 'B'. If 'A' is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is `m`. Otherwise, `ans` is `m` if 'A' is in `hmp` and `ans` was 0, otherwise `ans` is increased by `m`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated. If 'A' is not in the dictionary `hmp`, then `ans` is now equal to `m`. If 'A' is in `hmp`, then `ans` is now equal to its previous value plus `m`, but only if its previous value was 0.
