Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is 'A', and `ans` is `m`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been increased by `m`, which is an integer between 1 and 5. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now equal to `m`. The rest of the variables retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
