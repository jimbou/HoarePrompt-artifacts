Output State: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is a string that has 6 characters, `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is the last character in the string `p`. If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m`.


In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `hmp` as in the initial state. The string `p` will have 6 characters, and the variable `i` will be the last character in the string `p`. If `i` is not present in the dictionary `hmp`, the value of `ans` will be increased by `m`.
