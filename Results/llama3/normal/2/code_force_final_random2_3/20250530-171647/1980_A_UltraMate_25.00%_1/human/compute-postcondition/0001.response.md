The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) followed by a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. So for the loop to be executed  `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) followed by a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
