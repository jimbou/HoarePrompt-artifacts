Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the total number of characters needed to make the count of each character in a given string at least a certain threshold (m). The function takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the result for each test case. It modifies the state of stdin by consuming the input and leaves the program in a state where stdin contains 0 test cases.**
