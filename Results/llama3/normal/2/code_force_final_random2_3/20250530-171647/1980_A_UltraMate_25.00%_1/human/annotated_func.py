#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) followed by a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 0 and 1000, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s, i is the last key in the dictionary hmp. If the count of any character in string s is less than m, then ans is increased by m - hmp[i] for each such character, and the value of ans is being printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the total number of characters needed to make the count of each character in a given string at least a certain threshold (m). The function takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the result for each test case. It modifies the state of stdin by consuming the input and leaves the program in a state where stdin contains 0 test cases.
