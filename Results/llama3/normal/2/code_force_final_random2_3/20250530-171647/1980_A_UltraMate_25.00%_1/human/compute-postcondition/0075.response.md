Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least one character, `p` is a string that has 6 characters, `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` that must have at least two keys, `i` is a different key in `hmp` that has not been iterated over yet, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the difference between `m` and the count of character `i` in string `s`. The values of other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases. The dictionary `hmp` still has at least two keys. The character `i` is still a different key in `hmp` that has not been iterated over yet.
