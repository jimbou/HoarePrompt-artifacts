Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is a string that has at least 2 characters, `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is the second character in the string `p`, `ans` is increased by `m`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the value of `m`, which is an integer between 1 and 5. The values of all other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
