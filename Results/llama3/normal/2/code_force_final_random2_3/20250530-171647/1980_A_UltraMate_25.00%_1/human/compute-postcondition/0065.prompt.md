Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, s is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string s, i is the last key in the dictionary hmp, ans is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in p:
    if i not in hmp:
        ans += m


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is a string that has at least 1 character, `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is the first character in the string `p`. If `i` is not present in the dictionary `hmp`, then `ans` is set to `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is a string that has at least 2 characters, `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is the second character in the string `p`. If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is a string that has at least 3 characters, `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is the third character in the string `p`. If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
