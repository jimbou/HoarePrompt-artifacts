The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and string `p`. If `i` is in `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `p` is 'ABCDEF'. For the loop to execute again `i` must be the second character in the string `p` which is 'B'.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is 'B'.**
