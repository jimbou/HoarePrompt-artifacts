Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and must have at least 3 key-value pairs, `i` is the third key in the dictionary, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the difference between `m` and the count of the third character in the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
