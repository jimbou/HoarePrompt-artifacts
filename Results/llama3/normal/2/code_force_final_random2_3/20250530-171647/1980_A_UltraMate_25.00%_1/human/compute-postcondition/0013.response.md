Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `ans` is an integer between 0 and 5*m, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is 'F'. If any character in `p` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is increased by `m` for each such character.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations means that the loop has checked each character in the string `p` ('ABCDEF') against the dictionary `hmp`, which contains the count of each character in the string `s`. If a character from `p` is not found in `hmp`, the value of `ans` is increased by `m` for each such character. The final value of `ans` will be between 0 and 5*m, depending on how many characters from `p` are not present in `s`. The loop has iterated over all characters in `p`, so `i` is now 'F', the last character in `p`.
