Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is a string that has at least 1 character, `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s`, `i` is the first character in the string `p`, `ans` is `m` (because `ans` was 0 and `m` is added to it), and the current value of `i` is not present in the dictionary `hmp`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to `m`, which is an integer between 1 and 5. All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being an integer between 2 and 1000, `n` and `m` being integers within their respective ranges, `s` being a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` being a string with at least one character, `hmp` being a dictionary with character counts from string `s`, and `i` being the first character in string `p` that is not present in dictionary `hmp`.
