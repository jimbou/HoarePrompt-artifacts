The code prints the value of `ans`, which is an integer between 0 and 5*m. Since `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, the maximum value of `ans` can be 25 (5*5). However, the exact value of `ans` depends on the values of `n`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, and `i`, which are not explicitly provided in the initial state.

Output: **an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive)**
