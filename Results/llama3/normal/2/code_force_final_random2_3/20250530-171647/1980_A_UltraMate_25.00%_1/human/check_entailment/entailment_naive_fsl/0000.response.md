Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of problems in the bank (n) is less than the number of upcoming rounds (m). In this case, the program will count the number of problems that need to be created for each difficulty level, but it will not consider the fact that there are not enough problems in the bank to cover all the rounds.

For example, if n = 3, m = 5, and the difficulties of the problems in the bank are 'ABC', the program will output 10, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 7, because Vlad needs to come up with 7 more problems to hold 5 rounds (2 problems of difficulty level 'D', 2 problems of difficulty level 'E', 2 problems of difficulty level 'F', and 1 problem of difficulty level 'G').

The program should be modified to handle this case correctly. One possible solution is to add a check at the beginning of the function to see if n is less than m, and if so, output the difference between m and the number of unique difficulty levels in the bank.
