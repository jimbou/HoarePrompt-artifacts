Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and is greater than 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and must have at least 1 key-value pair, `i` is the first key in the dictionary `hmp`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is increased by the difference between `m` and the count of the first character `i` in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `stdin`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, and `hmp` remain unchanged. The dictionary `hmp` still contains at least one key-value pair, and `i` is still the first key in the dictionary.
