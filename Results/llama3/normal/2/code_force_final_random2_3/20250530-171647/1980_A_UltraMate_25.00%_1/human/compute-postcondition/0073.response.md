Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least one character, `p` is a string that has 6 characters, `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` that must have at least one key, `i` is a different key in `hmp` that has not been iterated over yet. If the count of character `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.***
