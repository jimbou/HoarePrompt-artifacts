Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and is greater than 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least one character, `p` is a string that has 6 characters, `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` that must have at least one key, `i` is the last key in `hmp`. If the count of the last key in `hmp` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has iterated over all the keys in the `hmp` dictionary. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The loop has checked each character in the string `s` and if its count is less than `m`, it has increased the `ans` variable by the difference. The loop has finished executing when it has checked all the characters in the string `s`.
