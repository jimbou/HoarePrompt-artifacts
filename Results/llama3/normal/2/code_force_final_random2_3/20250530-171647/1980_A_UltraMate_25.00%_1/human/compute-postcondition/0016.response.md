Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and is greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `s` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `ans` is an integer between `m-hmp[i]` and 5*m, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a dictionary where keys are characters from 'A' to 'G' and values are their respective counts in string `s` and must have at least 1 key-value pair, `i` is the first key in the dictionary.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its previous value. The value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, so the new value of `ans` is between `m-hmp[i]` and 5*m. All other variables remain unchanged.
