The code `casos = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input, which is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 20), to the variable `casos`. The stdin now contains `t` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20).

Output State: **`casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), stdin contains `casos` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20)**
