Based on the precondition, the code will print the string '..##..##'.

The variables `casos`, `c`, `n`, and the contents of stdin do not affect the output of the print statement, as they are not used in the statement.

The string '##..##..' and '##..##..' are printed before the given print statement, but they do not affect the output of the given print statement.

Therefore, the output will be the string '..##..##'.


Output: **..##..##**
