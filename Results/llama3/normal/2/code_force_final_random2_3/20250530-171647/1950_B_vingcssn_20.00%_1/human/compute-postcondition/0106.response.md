Output State: **`casos` is an integer between 3 and 20 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), stdin contains `casos - 4` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), which was read from the input. The stdin now contains `casos - 4` lines, as one line has been read and processed. The values of `casos` and `c` remain unchanged.
