Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. It only handles specific cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4, but it does not provide a general solution for any value of n. For example, if n = 5, the program will print "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard.

To fix this, the program should use a loop to generate the checkerboard for any value of n, rather than hardcoding specific cases.
