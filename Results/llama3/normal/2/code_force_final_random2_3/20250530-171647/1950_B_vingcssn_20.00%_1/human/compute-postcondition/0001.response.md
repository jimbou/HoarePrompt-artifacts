To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `c` and `casos`. The loop will execute if `casos` is at least 1. Since `casos` is already between 1 and 20 (inclusive), we can conclude that `casos` must be at least 1. Additionally, `c` is initialized to 0, so we can set `c` to 0.

State: **`casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), `c` is 0, stdin contains `casos` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20)**
