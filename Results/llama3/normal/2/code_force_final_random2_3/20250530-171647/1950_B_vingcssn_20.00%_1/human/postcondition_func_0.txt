This function reads a number of test cases (between 1 and 20) from standard input, then for each test case, it reads an integer (between 1 and 20) and prints a specific pattern of '#' and '.' characters based on the integer value. If the integer is 1, it prints '##' twice. If the integer is 2, it prints '##..' and '..##' twice. If the integer is 3, it prints '##..##', '..##..', and '##..##' twice. If the integer is 4, it prints '##..##..' eight times. If the integer is larger than 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'.
