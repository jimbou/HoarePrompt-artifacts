The only variable in the loop head is variable  c and casos, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c` and `casos`. If `c` is less than `casos`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 0, `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `c` is increased by 1 so `c` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `casos` must be greater than 1.
State: **`casos` is an integer between 2 and 20 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), stdin contains `casos - 2` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20)**
