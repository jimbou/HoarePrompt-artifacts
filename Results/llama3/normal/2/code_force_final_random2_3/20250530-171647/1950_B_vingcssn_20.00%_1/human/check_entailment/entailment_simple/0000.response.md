Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement asks to output a 2n x 2n checkerboard for any given integer n between 1 and 20 (inclusive). However, the provided program only handles cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 explicitly. For any other value of n between 5 and 20, the program prints 'No esta en el rango' (which means 'Not in the range' in Spanish), instead of generating the correct checkerboard.

The program does not have a general solution for any n, it only has hardcoded solutions for a few specific cases. A correct solution would involve using loops to generate the checkerboard pattern for any given n.

Correctness: **False**
