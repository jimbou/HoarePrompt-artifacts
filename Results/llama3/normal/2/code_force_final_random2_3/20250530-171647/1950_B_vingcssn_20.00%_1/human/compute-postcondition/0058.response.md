Output State: **`casos` is an integer between 2 and 20 (inclusive), `c` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), stdin contains `casos - 3` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20)**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value read from the first line of the input, which is between 1 and 20 (inclusive). The values of `casos` and `c` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `casos - 3` lines, each containing an integer `n` between 1 and 20 (inclusive), since one line has been read and processed.
