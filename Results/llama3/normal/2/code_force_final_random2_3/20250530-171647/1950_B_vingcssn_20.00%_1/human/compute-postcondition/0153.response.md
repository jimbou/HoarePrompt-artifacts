Output State: **`casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), `c` is `casos - 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), stdin is empty. If `n` is 1, '##' is printed. If `n` is 2, '##..' is printed, '..##' is printed, and '..##' is printed. If `n` is 3, '##..##' is printed, '..##..' is printed, '..##..' is printed, '##..##' is printed, and '##..##' is printed. If `n` is 4, '##..##..' is printed eight times. If `n` is larger than 4, 'No esta en el rango' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `c` has reached `casos - 1`. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), but stdin is now empty since all input lines have been processed. The printing of patterns based on the value of `n` continues as before, with the same patterns being printed for each value of `n`.
