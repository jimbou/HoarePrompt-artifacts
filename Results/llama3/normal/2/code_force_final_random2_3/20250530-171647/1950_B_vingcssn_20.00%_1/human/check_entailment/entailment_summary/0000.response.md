Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly generate the checkerboard pattern for all possible inputs. The program only handles the cases where n is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and for larger values of n, it prints 'No esta en el rango' (which means 'Not in the range' in Spanish). However, the problem statement requires the program to generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of n between 1 and 20.

Moreover, the program's logic for generating the pattern is not scalable and is repeated for each case, which makes it inefficient and prone to errors.

A correct solution would involve using loops to generate the pattern dynamically based on the value of n, rather than hardcoding the patterns for each case.

Correctness: **False**
