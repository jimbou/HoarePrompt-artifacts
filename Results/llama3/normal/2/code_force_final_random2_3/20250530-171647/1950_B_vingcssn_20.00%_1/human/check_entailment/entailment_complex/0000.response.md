Reasoning:

The given program is not correct because it does not handle cases where the input integer `n` is greater than 4. According to the problem description, the program should output a 2n x 2n checkerboard for any integer `n` between 1 and 20 (inclusive). However, the program only handles cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and prints "No esta en el rango" for any other value of `n`.

To fix this, the program should be modified to generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of `n` between 1 and 20. This can be done using nested loops to print the '#' and '.' characters in the correct pattern.

Correctness: **False**
