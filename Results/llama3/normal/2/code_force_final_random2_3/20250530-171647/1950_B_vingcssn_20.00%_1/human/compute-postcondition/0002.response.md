The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer input from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since stdin contains `casos` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20), the value of `n` will be an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive). The values of the other variables, `casos` and `c`, are not affected.

Output State: **`casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), stdin contains `casos - 1` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20)**
