The only variable in the loop head is variable  c and casos, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c` and `casos`. If `c` is less than `casos`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 1, `casos` is an integer between 2 and 20 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `c` is increased by 1 so `c` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `casos` must be greater than 2.
State: **`casos` is an integer between 3 and 20 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), stdin contains `casos - 3` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20). If `n` is 1, '##' is printed. If `n` is 2, '##..' is printed, '..##' is printed, and '..##' is printed. If `n` is 3, '##..##' is printed, '..##..' is printed, '..##..' is printed, '##..##' is printed, and '##..##' is printed. If `n` is 4, '##..##..' is printed, followed by '##..##..', '..##..##', '##..##..', '##..##..', and '..##..##'. If `n` is larger than 4, 'No esta en el rango' is printed.**
