Postcondition: ***`casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), `c` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 20 (inclusive), stdin contains `casos - 1` lines each containing an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 20). If `n` is 2, then '##..' is printed, '..##' is printed, and '..##' is printed. If `n` is 3, then the following patterns are printed: '##..##', '##..##', '..##..', '..##..', '##..##', '##..##'. If `n` is 4, then the following patterns are printed: '##..##..', '##..##..', '..##..##', '..##..##', '##..##..', '##..##..', '..##..##', '..##..##'. If `n` is larger than 4, then 'No esta en el rango' is printed.***
