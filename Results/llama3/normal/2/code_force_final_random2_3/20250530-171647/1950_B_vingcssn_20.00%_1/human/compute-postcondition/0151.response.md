Postcondition: ***`casos` is an integer between 3 and 20 (inclusive), `c` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), stdin contains `casos - 4` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20). If `n` is 2, '##..' is being printed, '..##' is printed, and '..##' is printed. If `n` is 3, '##..##' is being printed, '..##..' is being printed, '..##..' is being printed, and '##..##' is being printed, and '##..##' is being printed. If `n` is 4, '##..##..' is being printed eight times. Otherwise, 'No esta en el rango' is being printed.***
