Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains multiple test cases, and splits it into three integers: n, a, and b. The value of n is greater than 0. The value of k is the minimum of n and b - a. Since n is greater than 0, k will also be greater than or equal to 0. The value of _ remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains one less test case.
