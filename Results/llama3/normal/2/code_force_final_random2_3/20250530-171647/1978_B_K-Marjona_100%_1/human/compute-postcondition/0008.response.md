Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed. If b is larger than a, the expression b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a is printed.***
