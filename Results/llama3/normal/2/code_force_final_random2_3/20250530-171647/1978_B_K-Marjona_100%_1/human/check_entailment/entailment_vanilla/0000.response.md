Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program takes into account the promotion where the first k buns are sold at a modified price, and the remaining (n - k) buns are sold at the usual price.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of buns (n), the usual price of a bun (a), and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b).
3. It calculates the value of k, which is the minimum of n and (b - a). This is because k cannot be greater than n (the number of buns) or (b - a) (the difference between the modified price and the usual price).
4. If b is less than or equal to a, it means that the modified price is not beneficial, so the program prints the profit as a * n (the usual price multiplied by the number of buns).
5. If b is greater than a, the program calculates the profit as follows:
   - b * k: This is the total revenue from selling the first k buns at the modified price.
   - k * (k - 1) // 2: This is the total discount given to the first k buns. The discount for each bun is 1 coin less than the previous bun, so the total discount is the sum of the first k natural numbers, which is k * (k - 1) // 2.
   - (n - k) * a: This is the revenue from selling the remaining (n - k) buns at the usual price.
   The program prints the total profit as the sum of these three components.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately calculates the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns.

Correctness: **True**
