Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, n, a, and b are assigned new integer values from stdin, k is assigned the minimum value between n and b - a. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed. Otherwise, the value of b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a is printed.***
