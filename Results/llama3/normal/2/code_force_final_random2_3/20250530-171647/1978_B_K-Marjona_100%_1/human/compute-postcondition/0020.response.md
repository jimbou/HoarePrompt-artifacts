The code prints the result of the expression `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. 

Here, `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated result.

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum value between n and b - a, n is an integer greater than 0, a and b are integers)**
