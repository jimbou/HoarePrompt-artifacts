Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) â€” the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    k = min(n, b - a)
    if b <= a:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed. If b is larger than a, the expression b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n, a, and b are assigned new integer values from stdin, k is assigned the minimum value between n and b - a. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed. Otherwise, the result of the expression b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a is printed, where k is min(n, b - a), b * k is the product of b and k, k * (k - 1) // 2 is the sum of the first k-1 integers, and (n - k) * a is the product of n-k and a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, n, a, and b are assigned new integer values from stdin, k is assigned the minimum value between n and b - a. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed. Otherwise, the value of b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
