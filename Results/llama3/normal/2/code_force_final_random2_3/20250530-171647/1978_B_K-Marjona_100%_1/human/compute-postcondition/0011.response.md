Based on the initial state, the code will print the product of `a` and `n`. Since `n` is an integer greater than 0, and `a` is an integer, the product will be an integer.

The value of `a` is assigned from `stdin`, which means it can be any integer. Similarly, the value of `n` is also assigned from `stdin`, but it is guaranteed to be greater than 0.

Therefore, the output will be the product of the integer `a` and the positive integer `n`.

Output: **a*n (where a is an integer and n is a positive integer)**
