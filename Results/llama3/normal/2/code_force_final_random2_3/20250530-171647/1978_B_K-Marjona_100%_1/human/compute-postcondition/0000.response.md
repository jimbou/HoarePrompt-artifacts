The only variables in the loop head are the variable `_` and the `input()` function. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()` function. If the `input()` function returns a value that can be converted to an integer and is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` returns a value that can be converted to an integer and is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, `input()` returns a value that can be converted to an integer and is greater than 0, `_` is 0**
