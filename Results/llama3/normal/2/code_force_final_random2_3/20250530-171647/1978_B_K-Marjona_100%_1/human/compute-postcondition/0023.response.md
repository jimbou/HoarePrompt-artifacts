Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer, _ is equal to the number of test cases in stdin, stdin is empty, n, a, and b are assigned the last set of integer values from stdin, k is assigned the minimum value between n and b - a. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed. Otherwise, the value of b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the number of test cases in the input, the input will be exhausted (i.e., `stdin` will be empty), and the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` will hold the values from the last test case. The output will be the result of the calculation based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `k`, which will be either the product of `a` and `n` if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, or the result of the expression `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` otherwise.
