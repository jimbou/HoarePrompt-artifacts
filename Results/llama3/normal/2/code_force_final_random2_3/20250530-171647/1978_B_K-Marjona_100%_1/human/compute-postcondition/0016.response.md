The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and there are multiple test cases minus one left. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, k is an integer, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n, a, and b are assigned new integer values from stdin, k is assigned the minimum value between n and b - a. If b is less than or equal to a, the product of a and n is printed. Otherwise, the result of the expression b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a is printed, where k is min(n, b - a), b * k is the product of b and k, k * (k - 1) // 2 is the sum of the first k-1 integers, and (n - k) * a is the product of n-k and a.**
