The code prints the product of `a` and `n`, where `a` is an integer and `n` is an integer greater than 0. Since `n` is assigned a new integer value from `stdin` and `a` is also assigned a new integer value from `stdin`, the exact values of `a` and `n` are not known. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of `a` and `n`.
Output: **a*n (where a is the new integer value assigned to a from stdin and n is the new integer value assigned to n from stdin)**
