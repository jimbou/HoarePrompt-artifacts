Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order. If check_all is true, 'YES' is printed. If check_all is false, then if a subset of a, new, is found where all elements are less than or equal to a[0] and new is sorted in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
