Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 2, `new` is a list of `n-2` integers (1 <= `new_i` <= 10^6), `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` remain the same as in the initial state. However, we exit the innermost loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
