Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement after checking the conditions of the list `new`, or prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, depending on whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to `a[0]`.***
