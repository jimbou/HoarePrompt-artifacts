Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 3, new is a list of n-3 integers (1 <= new_i <= 10^6), check_all_new is a boolean indicating whether the first element of a is greater than or equal to all elements in new, new_all is a boolean indicating whether new is sorted in non-decreasing order. If check_all_new and new_all are both true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
