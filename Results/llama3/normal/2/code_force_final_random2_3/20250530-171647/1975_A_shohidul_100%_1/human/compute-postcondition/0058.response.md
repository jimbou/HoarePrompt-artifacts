Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then a new list `new` of `n - 1` integers (1 <= `new_i` <= 10^6) is created, and a boolean `check_all_new` is set to indicate whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`. Another boolean `new_all` is set to indicate whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are True, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited without printing 'YES'.***
