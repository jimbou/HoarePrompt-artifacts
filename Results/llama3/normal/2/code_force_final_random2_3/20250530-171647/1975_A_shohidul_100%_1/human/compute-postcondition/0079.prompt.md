Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then a new list `new` of `n - 1` integers (1 <= `new_i` <= 10^6) is created, and a boolean `check_all_new` is set to indicate whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`. Another boolean `new_all` is set to indicate whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are True, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited without printing 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]`, then a new list `new` of `n-2` integers (1 <= `new_i` <= 10^6) is created, and a boolean `check_all_new` is set to indicate whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 3 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then a new list `new` is created as a subset of `a`, and a boolean `check_all_new` is set to indicate whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`. Another boolean `new_all` is set to indicate whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
