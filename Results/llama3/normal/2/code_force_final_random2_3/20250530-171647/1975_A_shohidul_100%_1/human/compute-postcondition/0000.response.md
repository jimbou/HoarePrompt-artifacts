The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), the input for `t` is the first integer from the first test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), and the first integer from the first test case has been read and assigned to `t`.**
