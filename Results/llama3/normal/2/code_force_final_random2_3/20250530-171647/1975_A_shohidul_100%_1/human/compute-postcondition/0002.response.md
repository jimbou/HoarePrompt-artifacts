Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was already assigned the first integer from the first test case. The value of `n` is updated to the integer read from the input, which is between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The list `a` is populated with `n` integers read from the input, each between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive). The variable `check_all` is assigned a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. Finally, stdin now contains one less test case than initially, as one test case has been read and processed.
