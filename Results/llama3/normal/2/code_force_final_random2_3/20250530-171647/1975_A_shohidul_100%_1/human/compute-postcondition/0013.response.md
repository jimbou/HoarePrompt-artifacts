Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is False, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1, new is a list of n - 1 integers (1 <= new_i <= 10^6), check_all_new is True, and new_all is True, indicating that all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0] and the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values and properties, as the break statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The program has printed 'YES' and is now outside the innermost loop or if statement.
