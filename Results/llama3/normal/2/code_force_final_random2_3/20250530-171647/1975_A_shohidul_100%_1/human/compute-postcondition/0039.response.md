Postcondition: ***The program checks if the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to `a[0]`. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, the program prints 'YES' if the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the program does not take any action. `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2***
