Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 2, new is a list of n-2 integers (1 <= new_i <= 10^6), check_all_new is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order.**

The code snippet has the following effects on the program state:

* The first line creates a new list `new` containing all elements of `a` starting from index `i` (which is 2). This means `new` will have `n-2` elements.
* The second line calculates a boolean value `check_all_new` indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a` (`a[0]`). This is done by comparing each element of `new` with `a[0]` using a list comprehension.
* The third line calculates another boolean value `new_all` indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing each element of `new` with its previous element using a list comprehension.

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The new variables `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` are introduced, and their values are determined based on the original list `a` and the index `i`.
