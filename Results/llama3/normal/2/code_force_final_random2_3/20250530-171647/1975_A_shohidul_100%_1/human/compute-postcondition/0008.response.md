Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `check_all` is False, `i` is 1. The current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`.***
