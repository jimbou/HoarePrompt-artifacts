Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then a new list `new` of `n-1` integers is created, `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
