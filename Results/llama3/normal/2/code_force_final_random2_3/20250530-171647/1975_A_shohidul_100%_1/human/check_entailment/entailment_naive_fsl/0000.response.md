Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the program will print "NO" because it only checks if the first element of the suffix is less than or equal to the last element of the prefix, but it does not check if the rest of the suffix is in non-decreasing order.

Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
Expected Output:
```
YES
```
Actual Output:
```
NO
```
The program does not correctly handle cases where the suffix is in non-decreasing order but the prefix is not. It only checks if the first element of the suffix is less than or equal to the last element of the prefix, but it does not check the rest of the suffix.

To fix this, the program should check if the suffix is in non-decreasing order, not just the first element of the suffix. Here is a corrected version of the program:
```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
```
This corrected version of the program checks if the suffix is in non-decreasing order, not just the first element of the suffix.
