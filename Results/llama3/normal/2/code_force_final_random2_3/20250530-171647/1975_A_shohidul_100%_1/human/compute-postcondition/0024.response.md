Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `new` is a list of `n - 1` integers (1 <= `new_i` <= 10^6), `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the only effect of the code is to exit the current loop or if statement.
