Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), and the first integer from the first test case has been read and assigned to `t`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
    if check_all:
        print('YES')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                new = a[i:]
                check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))]
                    )
                new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len
                    (new))])
                if check_all_new and new_all:
                    print('YES')
                    break
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). If the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed. If the list a is not sorted in non-decreasing order, then if a new list is created by removing the first element of a and this new list is sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to the first element of a, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order. If check_all is true, 'YES' is printed. If check_all is false, then if a subset of a, new, is found where all elements are less than or equal to a[0] and new is sorted in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order. If check_all is true, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if a is sorted in non-decreasing order and the first element of a is greater than or equal to all elements in a new list new, and new is sorted in non-decreasing order, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
