Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). If the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed. If the list a is not sorted in non-decreasing order, then if a new list is created by removing the first element of a and this new list is sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to the first element of a, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed.**
