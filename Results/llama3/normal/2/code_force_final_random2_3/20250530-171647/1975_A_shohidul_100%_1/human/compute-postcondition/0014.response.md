Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is False, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1, new is a list of n - 1 integers (1 <= new_i <= 10^6), check_all_new is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order. Either not all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0] or the list new is not sorted in non-decreasing order.***
