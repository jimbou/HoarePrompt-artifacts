Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive). Then, it reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The list `a` contains integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive). The third line checks whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing each element with its previous element. The result of this check is assigned to the variable `check_all`, which is a boolean value indicating whether the list is sorted or not. The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the code.
