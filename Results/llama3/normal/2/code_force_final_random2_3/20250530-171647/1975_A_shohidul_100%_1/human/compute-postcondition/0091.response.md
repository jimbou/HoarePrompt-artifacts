Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and must be greater than 1, a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 1, new is a list of n-1 integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all_new is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order, and currently, both check_all_new and new_all are true, meaning all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0] and the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables t, n, a, check_all, i, new, check_all_new, and new_all remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
