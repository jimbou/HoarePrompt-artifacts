Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is False, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1, new is a list of n - 1 integers (1 <= new_i <= 10^6), check_all_new is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order.**

In this output state, the value of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` is still 1 as it is not modified by the code. The code creates two new variables `new` and `check_all_new`. The variable `new` is a list of `n - 1` integers, which are the elements of `a` starting from the second element (index 1) to the end. The variable `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a` (a[0]). The variable `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
