Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is `n-1`. If `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]`, then a new list `new` of 1 integer (1 <= `new_i` <= 10^6) is created, and a boolean `check_all_new` is set to indicate whether the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`. Another boolean `new_all` is set to indicate whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The loop will have checked all pairs of adjacent elements in the list `a` and will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to `a[0]`. If `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]`, the program will have created a new list `new` of 1 integer and will have set the booleans `check_all_new` and `new_all` accordingly.
