Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 3, `new` is a list of `n-3` integers (1 <= `new_i` <= 10^6), `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`, `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the program execution is interrupted by the break statement.
