Output State: **a is sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to a[0], i is 2, n is greater than 2, new is a sublist of a starting from index i, check_all_new is True if all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], otherwise False, new_all is True if new is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise False, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
