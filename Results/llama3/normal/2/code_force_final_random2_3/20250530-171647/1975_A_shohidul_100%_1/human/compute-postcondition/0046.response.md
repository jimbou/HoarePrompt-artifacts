To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`). 

Since `n` is already given to be between 2 and 50 (inclusive), we don't need to adjust its state further. However, we do need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure it starts at 1, as specified in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 1**
