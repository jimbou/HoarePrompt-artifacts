Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 1, new is a list of n - 1 integers (1 <= new_i <= 10^6), check_all_new is True, new_all is True, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties, as the break statement only exits the current loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The values of t, n, a, check_all, i, new, check_all_new, and new_all remain unchanged. Additionally, the program has printed 'YES' and has exited the innermost loop or if statement.
