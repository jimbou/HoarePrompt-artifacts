Output State: **`a` is sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i`, `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise False, `new_all` is True if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise False, 'YES' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` is still sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are still less than or equal to the first element `a[0]`. The value of `i` remains 2, and `n` is still greater than 2. The sublist `new` is still a part of `a` starting from index `i`. The boolean variable `check_all_new` still depends on whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` still depends on whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The string 'YES' is still being printed. However, the program now breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
