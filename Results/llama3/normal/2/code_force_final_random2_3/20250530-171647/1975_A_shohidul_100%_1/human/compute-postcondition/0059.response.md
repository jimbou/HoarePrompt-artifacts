The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 50. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 2**
