Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]`, then a new list `new` of `n-3` integers (1 <= `new_i` <= 10^6) is created, and a boolean `check_all_new` is set to indicate whether the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`. Another boolean `new_all` is set to indicate whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
