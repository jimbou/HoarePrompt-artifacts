Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 3 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then a new list `new` is created as a subset of `a`, and a boolean `check_all_new` is set to indicate whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`. Another boolean `new_all` is set to indicate whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then no action is taken.***
