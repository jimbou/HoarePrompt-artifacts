Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 49 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order. If check_all is true, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if a is sorted in non-decreasing order and the first element of a is greater than or equal to all elements in a new list new, and new is sorted in non-decreasing order, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` will be between 0 and 49 (inclusive) because the loop will have executed `t` times, and `t` is initially between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The value of `n` and the list `a` will remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop head and body. The value of `check_all` will also remain unchanged because it is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and this condition does not change after the loop executes all the iterations. The program will print 'YES' if the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, or if a new list `new` is found where all elements are less than or equal to the first element of `a` and `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, the program will print 'NO'.
