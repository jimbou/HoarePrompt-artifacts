The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not specified, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6)**
