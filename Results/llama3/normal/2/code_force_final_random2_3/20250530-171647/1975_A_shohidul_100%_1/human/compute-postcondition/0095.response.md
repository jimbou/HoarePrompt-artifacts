Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and must be greater than 1, a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 1, new is a list of n-1 integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all_new is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order, Either check_all_new is false or new_all is false, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables t, n, a, check_all, i, new, check_all_new, and new_all remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'NO' is printed.
