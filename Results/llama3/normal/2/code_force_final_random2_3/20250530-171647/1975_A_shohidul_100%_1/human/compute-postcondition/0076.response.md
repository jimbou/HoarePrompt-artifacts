Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 3 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 3, new is a list of integers (a subset of a), check_all_new is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order, 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables t, n, a, check_all, i, new, check_all_new, and new_all remain unchanged. The only change is that we have exited the loop or if statement, and 'NO' is still printed.
