Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 3, new is a list of n-3 integers (1 <= new_i <= 10^6), check_all_new is a boolean indicating whether the first element of a is greater than or equal to all elements in new, new_all is a boolean indicating whether new is sorted in non-decreasing order**

The code executes as follows:

1. `new = a[i:]` assigns a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 3) to the end of the list to the variable `new`. This means `new` will contain the last `n-3` elements of `a`.

2. `check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])` checks whether the first element of `a` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`. This is done by creating a list of boolean values where each value represents whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `new`. The `all()` function then returns `True` if all elements in this list are `True`, and `False` otherwise.

3. `new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])` checks whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done by creating a list of boolean values where each value represents whether the current element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element. The `all()` function then returns `True` if all elements in this list are `True`, and `False` otherwise.

The final state includes all the variables from the initial state, with the addition of `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all`, which are calculated based on the values of `a` and `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, and `i` remain unchanged.
