Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order. If check_all is true, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if a is sorted in non-decreasing order and the first element of a is greater than or equal to all elements in a new list new, and new is sorted in non-decreasing order, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
