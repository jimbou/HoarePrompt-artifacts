Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 2 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2, new is a list of n - 1 integers (1 <= new_i <= 10^6), check_all_new is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], and new_all is a boolean indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order.**

The code creates a new list `new` by slicing the original list `a` from index `i` to the end. It then checks two conditions: `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`, and `new_all` is True if the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `_`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
