To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables `t`, `a`, `check_all` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 3**
