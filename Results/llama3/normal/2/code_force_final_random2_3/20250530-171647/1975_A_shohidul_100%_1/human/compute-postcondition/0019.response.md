Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then a new list `new` of `n - 1` integers (1 <= `new_i` <= 10^6) is created, `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both True, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then no action is taken.***
