Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and must be greater than 1, a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 1, new is a list of n-1 integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all_new is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `check_all` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` is still 1, as it is not modified by the code. The new variables `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` are introduced. `new` is a list of `n-1` integers, which are the elements of `a` starting from index `i` (which is 1) to the end of the list. `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`. `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
