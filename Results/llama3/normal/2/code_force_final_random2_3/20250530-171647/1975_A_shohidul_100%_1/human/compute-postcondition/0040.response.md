Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is `n`. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `n - 1`, then no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows: The loop iterates over the list `a` from the second element to the last element. If it finds a pair of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second, it checks if the sublist starting from the second element is sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to the first element of the original list. If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If no such pair of adjacent elements is found, the loop completes without taking any action.
