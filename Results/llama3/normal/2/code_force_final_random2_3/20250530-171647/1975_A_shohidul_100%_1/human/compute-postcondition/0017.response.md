Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is False, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1, new is a list of n - 1 integers (1 <= new_i <= 10^6), check_all_new is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The values of t, n, a, check_all, _, stdin, i, new, check_all_new, and new_all remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we exit the current loop or if statement.
