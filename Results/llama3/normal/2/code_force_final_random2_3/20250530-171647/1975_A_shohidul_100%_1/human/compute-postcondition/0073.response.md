Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 3 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is 3, new is a list of integers (a subset of a), check_all_new is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0], new_all is a boolean indicating whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables t, n, a, check_all, i, new, check_all_new, and new_all remain the same as in the initial state. The program has printed 'YES' and has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
