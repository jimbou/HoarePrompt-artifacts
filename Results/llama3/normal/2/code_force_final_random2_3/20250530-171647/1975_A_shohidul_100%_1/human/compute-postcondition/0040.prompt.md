Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and check_all is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then a new list `new` of `n - 1` integers (1 <= `new_i` <= 10^6) is created, `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both True, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The program checks if the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to `a[0]`. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, the program prints 'YES' if the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the program does not take any action.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The program checks if the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to `a[0]`. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, the program prints 'YES' if the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order and all its elements are less than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the program does not take any action. `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
