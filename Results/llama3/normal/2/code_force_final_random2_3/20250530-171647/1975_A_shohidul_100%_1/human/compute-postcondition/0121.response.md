Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the list is sorted, it prints 'YES'. If the list is not sorted, it checks if the first element is greater than or equal to all elements in the unsorted part of the list and if the unsorted part is sorted in non-decreasing order. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
