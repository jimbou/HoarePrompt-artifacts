The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 50. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6), `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then a new list `new` of `n - 1` integers (1 <= `new_i` <= 10^6) is created, `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both True, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, then no action is taken.**
