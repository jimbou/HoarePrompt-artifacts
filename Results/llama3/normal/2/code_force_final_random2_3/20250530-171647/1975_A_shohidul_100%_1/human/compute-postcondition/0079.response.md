Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), check_all is a boolean indicating whether the list a is sorted in non-decreasing order, i is n - 1. If a[i - 1] is greater than a[i] at any point during the loop, then a new list new is created as a subset of a, and a boolean check_all_new is set to indicate whether all elements in new are less than or equal to a[0]. Another boolean new_all is set to indicate whether the list new is sorted in non-decreasing order. If both check_all_new and new_all are true, 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i] at any point during the loop, then no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has checked all pairs of adjacent elements in the list `a` to see if they are in non-decreasing order. If at any point it finds a pair that is not in non-decreasing order, it creates a new list `new` that includes all elements after the first element that is not in non-decreasing order, and checks if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the first element of `a`. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' and exits the loop. If not, it prints 'NO' and exits the loop. If it doesn't find any pairs that are not in non-decreasing order, it doesn't take any action. The loop has iterated `n-1` times, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
