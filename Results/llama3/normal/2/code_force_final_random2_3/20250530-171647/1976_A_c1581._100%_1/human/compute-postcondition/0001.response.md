To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `char` and the string `password`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password` string. If the `password` string has at least 1 character, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, the `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, it needs to be adjusted to `password` must have at least 1 character.

The variable `char` is not initialized before the loop, so it needs to be adjusted to `char` is the first character in the `password` string.

The states of `digits` and `letters` are not relevant to the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in the `password` string, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list**
