Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in the `password` string and is not a digit, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string which is not a digit.**

In natural language, the output state means that the code has appended the first character of the password string, which is not a digit, to the list of letters. The password string remains unchanged, and the list of digits is still empty. The first character of the password string is still not a digit.
