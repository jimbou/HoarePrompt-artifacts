Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a list containing all the digits in the `password` string, `letters` is a list containing all the letters in the `password` string.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `password` string remains unchanged, but the `digits` list now contains all the digit characters from the `password` string, and the `letters` list contains all the letter characters from the `password` string.
