Reasoning:

The given program is designed to check if a password meets certain conditions: it should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, there should be no digit that comes after a letter, all digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order, and all letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program defines a function `func_1(password)` that separates the password into digits and letters, sorts them individually, and then checks if the sorted digits and letters are in the correct order within the password.

However, there is a logical error in the function. The condition `if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:` is unnecessary and incorrect. The `sort()` function is already used to sort the digits, so this condition will always be false. Moreover, the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is also incorrect. It checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, which is not a requirement.

The correct approach would be to check if the password can be formed by concatenating the sorted digits and letters. This can be done by comparing the sorted password with the original password.

Correctness: **False**
