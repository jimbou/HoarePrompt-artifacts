Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter. The current implementation only checks if the last digit is greater than any of the letters, which is not sufficient. It does not check if any digit comes after a letter in the password.

For example, the password "a1b2" would be incorrectly classified as a strong password by this program, because it does not check if any digit comes after a letter. However, according to the problem description, this password is not strong because the digit "2" comes after the letter "b".
