According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digits`. If `digits` has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password string, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `digits` must have at least 1 digit and `i` is now 0.

State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password string that must have at least 1 digit, letters is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password string, i is 0**
