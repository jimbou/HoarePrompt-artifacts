Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits in the `password` string, `letters` is a sorted list containing all the letters in the `password` string, `i` is equal to the length of `digits`, `sortedPassword` is a string consisting of the digits and letters from the `password` string, sorted in ascending order, and either `i` is equal to or greater than the second last index of `digits` or `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`.**

In this output state, the code has created a new variable `sortedPassword` which is a string consisting of the digits and letters from the `password` string, sorted in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that either `i` is equal to or greater than the second last index of `digits` or `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]` is still valid.
