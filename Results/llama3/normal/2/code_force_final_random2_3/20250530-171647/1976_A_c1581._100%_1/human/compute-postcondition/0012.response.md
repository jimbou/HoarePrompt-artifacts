The only objects in the loop head are variables  char and password, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the password.  If the password has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, password has at least 2 characters, char is the second character in the password. So for the loop to be executed one more time the password must have at least 3 characters and the char is the third character in the password.
State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the `password` string. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string, the second character of the `password` string and `char`, and `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string. If `char` is not a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string and the second character of the `password` string, and `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string and the second character of the `password` string and `char`.
