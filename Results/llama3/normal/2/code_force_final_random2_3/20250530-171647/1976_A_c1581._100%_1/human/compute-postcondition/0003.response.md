Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in the `password` string and is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string, `letters` is an empty list**

In this output state, the code has appended the first character of the `password` string, which is a digit, to the `digits` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The `password` string still consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits with at least 1 character, and the `char` variable still holds the first character of the `password` string, which is a digit. The `letters` list remains empty.
