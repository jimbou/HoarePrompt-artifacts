According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the password. If the password has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, password has at least 1 character, char is the first character in the password string. So for the loop to be executed one more time the password must have at least 2 characters and the char is the second character in the password string.
State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the `password` string. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is not a digit, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string.**
