Output State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password string, letters is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password string.**

The code snippet sorts the `digits` and `letters` lists in ascending order, but does not modify the `password` string. The `digits` list now contains the same digits as before, but in sorted order, and the `letters` list contains the same letters as before, also in sorted order. The `password` string remains unchanged, still consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
