The only object in the loop head is variable `char` and string `password`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the password string.  If the string has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, password has at least 2 characters, char is the second character in the password string. So for the loop to be executed one more time the password string must have at least 3 characters and the char is the third character in the password string.
State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the `password` string. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string, the second character of the `password` string and `char`, and `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string. If `char` is not a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string and the second character of the `password` string, and `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string and the second character of the `password` string and `char`.
