Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in the `password` string. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string, the second character of the `password` string and `char`, and `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string and `char`. If `char` is not a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string and the second character of the `password` string, and `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string, the second character of the `password` string and `char`.**

In this output state, the value of `password` and `char` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `letters` is updated by appending the value of `char` to it. If `char` is a digit, `letters` will contain the first character of the `password` string and `char`. If `char` is not a digit, `letters` will contain the first character of the `password` string, the second character of the `password` string and `char`. The value of `digits` remains the same as in the initial state.
