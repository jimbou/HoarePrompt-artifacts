Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password string, letters is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(digits)):
    if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
        return False
    if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
        return False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password string that must have at least 1 digit, letters is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password string, i is 0, and either i is equal to or greater than the second last index of digits or digits[i] is less than or equal to digits[i + 1]

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password string that must have at least 2 digits, letters is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password string, i is 1, and either i is equal to or greater than the second last index of digits or digits[i] is less than or equal to digits[i + 1]. If i is less than the second last index of digits and digits[i] is greater than digits[i + 1], the program returns False. Otherwise, no change is made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password string that must have at least 3 digits, letters is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password string, i is 2, and either i is equal to or greater than the second last index of digits or digits[i] is less than or equal to digits[i + 1]. If i is less than the second last index of digits and digits[i] is greater than digits[i + 1], the function returns False. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
