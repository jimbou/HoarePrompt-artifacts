If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string, the second character of the `password` string and `char`, and `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string. If `char` is not a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string and the second character of the `password` string, and `letters` is a list containing the first character of the `password` string, the second character of the `password` string and `char`.**

If char is a digit, the list of digits now includes the first character of the password, the second character of the password, and char. If char is not a digit, the list of digits remains the same, containing the first character of the password and the second character of the password, and the list of letters now includes the first character of the password, the second character of the password, and char.
