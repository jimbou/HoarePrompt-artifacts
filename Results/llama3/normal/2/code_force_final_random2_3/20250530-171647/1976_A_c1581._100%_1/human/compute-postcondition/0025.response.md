The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `digits`. If `i` is less than the length of `digits`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and either `i` is equal to or greater than the second last index of `digits` or `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. The length of `digits` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.
State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a sorted list containing all the digits in the password string that must have at least 3 digits, letters is a sorted list containing all the letters in the password string, i is 2, and either i is equal to or greater than the second last index of digits or digits[i] is less than or equal to digits[i + 1]**
