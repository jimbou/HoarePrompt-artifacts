Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, t is an empty list, ans is -1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(29, -1, -1):
    u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
    if u == v == 0:
        continue
    if u == 0:
        if v % 2:
            return ans
        else:
            op = ai = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                ai ^= val
                if not op:
                    t.append(ai)
                    ai = 0
            a, t = t, []
    elif v % 2:
        continue
    elif v:
        op = cnt = 0
        for val in a:
            op ^= val >> i & 1
            if not op:
                cnt += 1
        ans = max(ans, cnt)
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, if `u` is 0 then `v` is an even number, op is the result of op XOR (val >> 29 & 1) XOR ... XOR (val >> 29 & 1) for all elements in the list a, if op is 0 then ai is 0, otherwise ai is the result of ai XOR val XOR ... XOR val for all elements in the list a. If `u` is not equal to 0, then `v` is an odd number, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is even, then `op` is the result of XOR operation between all the elements in the list `a` and the 29th bit of each element in the list `a`, and `cnt` is the number of times `op` is False. If `v` is even and its current value is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in the list `a`. If `u` is 0 and `v` is 0, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `u` is not equal to 0 or `v` is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `u` is the 27th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 27th bits of all elements in the list `a`. If the 27th bits of `x` and the sum of the 27th bits of all elements in the list `a` are both 0, then we move on to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, and `v`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
