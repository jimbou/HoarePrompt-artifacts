Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, and `v` is 0, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current loop iteration, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.
