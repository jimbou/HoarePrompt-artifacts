The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 28. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be 27.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `u` is the 27th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 27th bits of all elements in the list `a`.**
