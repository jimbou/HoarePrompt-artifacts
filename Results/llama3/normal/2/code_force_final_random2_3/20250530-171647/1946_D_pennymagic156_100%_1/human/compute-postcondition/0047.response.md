Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29. `u` is not equal to 0. If `v` is even and its current value is True, then `op` is the result of XOR operation between all the elements in the list `a` and the 29th bit of each element in the list `a`, and `cnt` is the number of times `op` is False. If `v` is even and its current value is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
