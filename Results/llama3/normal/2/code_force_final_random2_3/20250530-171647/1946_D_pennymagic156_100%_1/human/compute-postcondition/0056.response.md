The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop provided in the initial state, we assume that the `continue` statement is inside a loop that is not shown.

The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `u` is the 27th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 27th bits of all elements in the list `a`, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
