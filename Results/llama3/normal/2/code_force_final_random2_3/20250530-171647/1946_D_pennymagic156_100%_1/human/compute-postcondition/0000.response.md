Output State: **n is a positive integer, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, t is an empty list, ans is -1**

The code snippet consists of four lines. The first line calls the function `func_3()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `x`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, their values are updated accordingly. The second line calls the function `func_1()` and assigns its return value to `a`, which is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30. The third line initializes an empty list `t` and assigns -1 to `ans`. 

After executing the entire code block, the values of `n`, `x`, and `a` are updated based on the return values of the functions `func_3()` and `func_1()`. The list `t` is initialized as an empty list, and `ans` is set to -1. The initial state's information about `n`, `x`, and `a` remains valid, as their types and ranges are not changed by the code.
