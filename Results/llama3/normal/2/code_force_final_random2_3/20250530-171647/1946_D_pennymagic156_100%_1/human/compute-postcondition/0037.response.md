Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is True, `val` is the second element in the list `a`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `op` is the result of XOR operation between the previous value of `op` and the 29th bit of the second element in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `op` has been updated based on the result of the XOR operation between its previous value and the 29th bit of the second element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
