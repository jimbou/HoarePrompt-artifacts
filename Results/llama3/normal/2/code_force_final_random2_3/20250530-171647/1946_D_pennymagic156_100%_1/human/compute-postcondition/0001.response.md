The only variables in the loop head are variable `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 29, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is now 29.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29**
