Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 1 element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is True, `cnt` is 0, `val` is the first element in the list `a`, `op` is the result of XOR operation between the current value of `op` and the 29th bit of the first element in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the value of `op`, which is now the result of an XOR operation between its previous value and the 29th bit of the first element in the list `a`.
