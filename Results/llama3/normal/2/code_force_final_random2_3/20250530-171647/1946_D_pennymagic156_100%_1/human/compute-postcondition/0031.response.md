To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `val` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 1 element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is True, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `val` is the first element in the list `a`**
