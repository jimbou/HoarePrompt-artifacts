Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in the list `a`. If `u` is 0 and `v` is 0, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `u` is not equal to 0 or `v` is not equal to 0.***
