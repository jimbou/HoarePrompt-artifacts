Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in the list `a`, if `u` is 0 then `v` is an even number, op is the result of op XOR (val >> 28 & 1) XOR ... XOR (val >> 28 & 1) for all elements in the list a, if op is 0 then ai is 0, otherwise ai is the result of ai XOR val XOR ... XOR val for all elements in the list a. If `u` is not equal to 0, then `v` is an odd number, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is even, then `op` is the result of XOR operation between all the elements in the list `a` and the 28th bit of each element in the list `a`, and `cnt` is the number of times `op` is False. If `v` is even and its current value is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `u` and `v` are updated based on the 28th bit of `x` and the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in the list `a`, respectively. The conditions related to `u`, `v`, `op`, and `cnt` are also updated accordingly.
