Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 2 elements, t is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, ans is -1, i is 29, u is 0, v is an even number, op is the result of op XOR (val >> 29 & 1), if op is 0, then ai is 0, otherwise ai is the result of ai XOR val, val is the second element in the list a.***
