Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is an even number, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 1 element, t is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, ans is -1, i is 29, u is 0, v is an even number, op is the result of op XOR (val >> 29 & 1), ai is the result of ai XOR val, val is the first element in the list a.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 2 elements, t is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, ans is -1, i is 29, u is 0, v is an even number, op is the result of op XOR (val >> 29 & 1), if op is 0, then ai is 0, otherwise ai is the result of ai XOR val, val is the second element in the list a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 3 elements, t is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, ans is -1, i is 29, u is 0, v is an even number, op is the result of op XOR (val >> 29 & 1) XOR (val >> 29 & 1), if op is 0 then ai is 0, otherwise ai is the result of ai XOR val XOR val, val is the third element in the list a.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
