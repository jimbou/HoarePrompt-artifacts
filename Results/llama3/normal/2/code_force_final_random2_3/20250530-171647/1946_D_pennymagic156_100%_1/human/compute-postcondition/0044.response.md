Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is an empty list, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is True, `op` is the result of XOR operation between all the elements in the list `a` and the 29th bit of each element in the list `a`, `cnt` is the number of times `op` is False.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` is empty, and the variable `op` is the result of XOR operation between all the elements in the list `a` and the 29th bit of each element in the list `a`. The variable `cnt` is the number of times `op` is False. The other variables remain unchanged.
