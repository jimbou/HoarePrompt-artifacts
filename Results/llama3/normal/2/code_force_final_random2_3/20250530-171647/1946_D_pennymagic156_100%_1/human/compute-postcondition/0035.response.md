Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 1 element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and its current value is True, `val` is the first element in the list `a`. If the result of XOR operation between the previous value of `op` and the 29th bit of the first element in the list `a` is False, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.***
