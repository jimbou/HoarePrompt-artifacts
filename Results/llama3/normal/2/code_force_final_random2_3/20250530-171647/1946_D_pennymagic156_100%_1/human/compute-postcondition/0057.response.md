Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 27, `u` is the 27th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 27th bits of all elements in the list `a`. If the 27th bits of `x` and the sum of the 27th bits of all elements in the list `a` are both 0, then we move on to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, and `v`.***
