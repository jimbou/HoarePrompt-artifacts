Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29. If `u` is 0 and `v` is 0, then we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
