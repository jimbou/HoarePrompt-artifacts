Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, `t` is a list containing the result of ai XOR val if op is 0, otherwise t is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in the list `a`, if `u` is 0 then `v` is an even number, op is the result of op XOR (val >> 28 & 1) XOR ... XOR (val >> 28 & 1) for all elements in the list a, if op is 0 then ai is 0, otherwise ai is the result of ai XOR val XOR ... XOR val for all elements in the list a. We skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables do not change, but we move on to the next iteration of the loop.
