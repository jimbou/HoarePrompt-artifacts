Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 2, `T` is 1, `bets` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of the original list divided by the original element, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is 0, `prod` is equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of the original list times the first `bets` elements of the updated list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    a[i] = prod // a[i]
    sumo += int(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 2, T is 1, bets is at least 1, a is a list of integers where each element is equal to the product of the first bets elements of the original list divided by the original element, except for the ith element which is now equal to prod // a[i], i is at least 1, sumo is equal to its original value plus the new value of a[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, T is 1, bets is at least 2, a is a list of integers where each element is equal to the product of the first bets elements of the original list divided by the original element, except for the i+1th element which is now equal to prod // a[i+1], i is at least 2, sumo is equal to its original value plus the new value of a[i] which is prod // a[i]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 2, T is 1, bets is at least 3, a is a list of integers where each element is equal to the product of the first bets elements of the original list divided by the original element, except for the i+1th element which is now equal to prod // a[i], i is at least 3, sumo is equal to its original value plus the new value of a[i] which is prod // a[i] plus the integer value of a[i].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
