Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, `bets` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    a[i] = prod // a[i]
    sumo += int(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, T is 0, bets is at least 1, a is a list of integers where the first element is equal to the product of the first bets elements of the original list divided by the original first element, i is 0, sumo is equal to the sum of the original first element and the product of the first bets elements of the original list divided by the original first element, prod is equal to the product of the first bets elements of the original list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 1, T is 0, bets is at least 2, a is a list of integers where the first element is equal to the product of the first bets elements of the original list divided by the original first element, i is 1, sumo is equal to the sum of the original first element and the product of the first bets elements of the original list divided by the original first element plus the integer value of a[i], prod is equal to the product of the first bets elements of the original list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 1, T is 0, bets is at least 3, a is a list of integers where the first element is equal to the product of the first bets elements of the original list divided by the original first element, i is 2, sumo is equal to the sum of the original first element and the product of the first bets elements of the original list divided by the original first element plus the integer value of a[i] plus the integer value of the updated a[i], prod is equal to the product of the first bets elements of the original list, a[i] is equal to the product of the first bets elements of the original list divided by the original a[i].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
