Output State: `t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `bets` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is not defined, `prod` is the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets`, `stdin` contains no input

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the initial value of `bets`, and the value of `prod` will be the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets`. The values of `t`, `T`, `a`, `sumo`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
