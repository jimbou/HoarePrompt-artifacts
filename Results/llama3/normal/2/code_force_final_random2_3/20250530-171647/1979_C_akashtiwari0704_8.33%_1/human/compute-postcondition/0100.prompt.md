You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). The second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20).
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = 1
        
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: t is equal to 0, T is equal to t, bets is a non-negative integer, a is a list of integers where the value at index i is the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i], i is equal to bets, sumo is the sum of the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i] for all i in range bets, prod is the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets, stdin contains no input. If the current value of sumo is greater than or equal to the current value of prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, bets is a positive integer, and the string ans containing all elements of a followed by a space is being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: t is equal to 0, T is equal to t, bets is a non-negative integer, a is a list of integers where the value at index i is the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i], i is equal to bets, sumo is the sum of the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i] for all i in range bets, prod is the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets, stdin contains no input. If the current value of sumo is greater than or equal to the current value of prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, bets is a positive integer, and the string ans containing all elements of a followed by a space is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
