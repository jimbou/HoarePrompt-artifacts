The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and bets, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `bets`. If `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `bets` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `bets` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, `bets` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is equal to the first element of `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**
