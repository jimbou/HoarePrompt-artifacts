Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of bets and a list of integers. It calculates the product of the integers and then replaces each integer with the product divided by the original integer. If the sum of these new integers is greater than or equal to the product, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the new list of integers. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.**
