Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is a list of multipliers that are not pairwise coprime. In such cases, the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers is not equal to the product of the multipliers, and the program's calculation of the bets based on the product of the multipliers is incorrect.

For example, if the input is [2, 4, 6], the program calculates the product as 48 and the bets as [24, 12, 8]. However, the LCM of [2, 4, 6] is 12, not 48. As a result, the sum of the bets (24 + 12 + 8 = 44) is not less than the LCM (12), and the program's output is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the program should calculate the LCM of the multipliers instead of their product, and use the LCM to calculate the bets.
