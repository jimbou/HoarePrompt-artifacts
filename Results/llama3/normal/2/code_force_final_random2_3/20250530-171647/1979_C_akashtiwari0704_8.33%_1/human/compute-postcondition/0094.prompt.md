Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `bets` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range `bets`, `prod` is the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets`, `ans` is an empty string, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `bets` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]`, `i` is 0, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range `bets`, `prod` is the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets`, `ans` is a string containing the first element of `a` followed by a space, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `bets` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]`, `i` is 2, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range `bets`, `prod` is the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets`, `ans` is a string containing the first three elements of `a` followed by a space, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `bets` is a positive integer and greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]`, `i` is 3, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range `bets`, `prod` is the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets`, `ans` is a string containing the first four elements of `a` followed by a space, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
