Output State: **t is at least 2, T is 2, bets is a non-negative integer, a is a list of integers where the value at index i is the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i], i is equal to bets, sumo is the sum of the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i] for all i in range bets, prod is the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets, stdin contains no input**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `t` is still at least 2, `T` remains 2, `bets` is still a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers where each value at index `i` is the result of the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]`, `i` is now equal to `bets` (indicating the loop has finished), `sumo` is the sum of all the integer divisions of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range `bets`, `prod` is still the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets`, and `stdin` still contains no input.
