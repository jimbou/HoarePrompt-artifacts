To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `bets`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `bets`. If `bets` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is equal to `bets`, we can adjust `i` to be at least 1 as well.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `bets` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is at least 1, `sumo` is not defined, `prod` is 1, `stdin` contains no input**
