Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program calculates the product of all the multipliers and then replaces each multiplier with the product divided by the original multiplier. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program also correctly handles the case where there is no way to distribute the coins as required, in which case it prints -1.

The time complexity of the program is O(t * n), where t is the number of test cases and n is the number of outcomes. This is because the program iterates over each test case and each outcome within each test case.

The space complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of outcomes. This is because the program stores the list of multipliers and the list of bets in memory.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
