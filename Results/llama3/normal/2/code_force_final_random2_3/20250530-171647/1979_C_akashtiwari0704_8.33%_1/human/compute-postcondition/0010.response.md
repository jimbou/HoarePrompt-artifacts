Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, `bets` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is 0**

The code introduces a new variable `sumo` and assigns it the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `sumo` is now part of the output state with a value of 0.
