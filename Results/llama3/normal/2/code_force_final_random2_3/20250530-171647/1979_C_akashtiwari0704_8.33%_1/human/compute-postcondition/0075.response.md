Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `bets` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is 0, `prod` is the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets`, `stdin` contains no input**

In natural language, this output state means that after the code has executed, the value of `sumo` has been initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `T`, `a`, `i`, `prod`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still equal to the initial value of `bets`, and the value of `prod` is still the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets`.
