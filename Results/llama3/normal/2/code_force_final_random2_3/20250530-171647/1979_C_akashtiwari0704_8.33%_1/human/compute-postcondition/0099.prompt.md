Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line containing an integer `n`, and the second line containing `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = 1
    for i in range(bets):
        prod *= a[i]
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, T is 0, bets is greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers where each element is equal to the product of the first bets elements of the original list divided by the original element, i is equal to bets - 1 or bets, sumo is equal to the sum of the integer values of the elements of the updated list a, prod is equal to the product of the first bets elements of the original list. If the current value of sumo is greater than or equal to the current value of prod, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, i is updated to bets, sumo is less than prod, and a string containing all elements of a separated by spaces is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 2, T is 1, bets is a non-negative integer, a is a list of integers where each element is equal to the product of the first bets elements of the original list divided by the original element, except for all elements which are now equal to prod // a[i], i is equal to bets, sumo is equal to the sum of all elements in the list a. If the current value of sumo is greater than or equal to prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, bets is equal to the number of elements in a, and a string containing all elements of a followed by a space is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 2, T is 2, bets is a non-negative integer, a is a list of integers where the value at index i is the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i], i is equal to bets, sumo is the sum of the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i] for all i in range bets, prod is the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets, stdin contains no input. If the current value of sumo is greater than or equal to the current value of prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, bets is a positive integer, and the string ans containing all elements of a followed by a space is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
