Output State: **t is at least 2, T is 2, bets is at least 3, a is a list of integers where the value at index i is the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i], i is 2, sumo is the sum of the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i] plus the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i] plus the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i], prod is the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `a` at index `i` has been updated to be the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]`. The value of `sumo` has been incremented by the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
