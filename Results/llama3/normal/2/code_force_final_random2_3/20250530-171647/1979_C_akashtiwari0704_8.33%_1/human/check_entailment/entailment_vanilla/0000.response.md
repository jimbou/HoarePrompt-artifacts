Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a` for each outcome.

3. It calculates the product `prod` of all multipliers.

4. Then, for each outcome, it calculates the bet amount as `prod // a[i]`, which is the largest integer less than or equal to `prod / a[i]`. This is done to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is minimized.

5. It calculates the total sum `sumo` of all bet amounts.

6. If the total sum `sumo` is greater than or equal to the product `prod`, it means that there is no way to distribute the coins as required, so it prints `-1`.

7. Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts for each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
