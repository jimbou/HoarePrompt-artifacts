Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `bets` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is at least 2, `sumo` is not defined, `prod` is the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and the value of `a[i]` squared, `stdin` contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `prod` has been updated to be the product of its initial value (1) and the square of the value of `a[i]`, since `prod` was already the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and the value of `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
