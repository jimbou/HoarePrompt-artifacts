Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the number of bets for each test case.
2.  It calculates the product of all the multipliers (k\_i) for each test case.
3.  Then, for each test case, it calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the product by the corresponding multiplier. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
4.  If the sum of the calculated bets is greater than or equal to the product, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.
5.  Otherwise, it prints the calculated bets for each outcome.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
