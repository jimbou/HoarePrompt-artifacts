To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `T` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `T` is 0.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line containing an integer `n`, and the second line containing `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.**
