The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line containing an integer `n`, we can conclude that the value of `t` is equal to the number of test cases.

The value of `t` is now equal to the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The standard input still contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line containing an integer `n`, and the second line containing `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line containing an integer `n`, and the second line containing `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.**
