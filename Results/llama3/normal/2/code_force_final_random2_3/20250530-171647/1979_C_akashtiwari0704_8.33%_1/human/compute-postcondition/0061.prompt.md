Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 2, `T` is 1, `bets` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of the original list divided by the original element, except for all elements which are now equal to `prod // a[i]`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 2, `T` is 1, `bets` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of the original list divided by the original element, except for all elements which are now equal to `prod // a[i]`, `i` is 1, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the first element of `a` followed by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `T` is 1, `bets` is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of the original list divided by the original element, except for all elements which are now equal to `prod // a[i]`, `i` is 2, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the first three elements of `a` followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 2, `T` is 1, `bets` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of the original list divided by the original element, except for all elements which are now equal to `prod // a[i]`, `i` is 3, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the first five elements of `a` followed by a space




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
