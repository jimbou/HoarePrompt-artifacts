To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `bets`. The loop will execute if `bets` is at least 1. Since `i` is initialized to `bets - 1` before the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting value for the loop.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `T` is 0, `bets` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `prod` is equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `i` is 0, `sumo` is 0**
