The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `bets`. If `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `bets` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `bets` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is at least 2, T is 2, bets is at least 2, a is a list of integers where the value at index i is the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i], i is 1, sumo is the sum of the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i], prod is the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets, stdin contains no input**
