Output State: **t is equal to 0, T is equal to t, bets is a non-negative integer, a is a list of integers where the value at index i is the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i], i is equal to bets, sumo is the sum of the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i] for all i in range bets, prod is the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets, stdin contains no input. If the current value of sumo is greater than or equal to the current value of prod, -1 is printed. Otherwise, bets is a positive integer, and the string ans containing all elements of a followed by a space is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of t is now 0. The value of T is equal to the initial value of t. The value of bets is a non-negative integer, and the list a contains integers that are the result of the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i]. The value of i is equal to bets, and the value of sumo is the sum of the integer division of the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets by the original value of a[i] for all i in range bets. The value of prod is the product of the initial value of prod (1) and all the values of a[i] for i in range bets. The input from stdin has been fully consumed. If the current value of sumo is greater than or equal to the current value of prod, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is a string containing all elements of a followed by a space.
