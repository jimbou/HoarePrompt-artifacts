State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `bets` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]`, `i` is 1, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range `bets`, `prod` is the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets`, `ans` is a string containing the first two elements of `a` followed by a space, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.**
