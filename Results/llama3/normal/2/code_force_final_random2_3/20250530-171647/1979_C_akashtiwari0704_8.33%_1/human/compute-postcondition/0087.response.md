Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 2, `bets` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets` by the original value of `a[i]` for all `i` in range `bets`, `prod` is the product of the initial value of `prod` (1) and all the values of `a[i]` for `i` in range `bets`, `ans` is an empty string, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ans` which is an empty string. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
