To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `bets`. The loop will execute if `bets` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `T` is 1, `bets` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of the original list divided by the original element, `i` is 0, `sumo` is equal to the sum of the integer values of the elements of the updated list `a`, `prod` is equal to the product of the first `bets` elements of the original list**
