Output State: **n is at least n, k are integers, L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than the maximum possible value of L plus 1, numCuts is 0, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers read from stdin, adj[a] contains b, adj[b] contains a, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of nodes 'n' is at least 'n', 'k' remains an integer, the lower bound 'L' is either 1 or 50001, the upper bound 'R' is greater than the maximum possible value of 'L' plus 1, the number of cuts 'numCuts' is 0, the adjacency list 'adj' is a list of 'n+1' lists where each list contains the nodes connected to it, 'z' is incremented by 1, 't' is greater than 'z + 1', the standard input 'stdin' is empty, the loop counter 'i' is 'n - 1', 'a' and 'b' are integers read from the standard input, the adjacency list 'adj' contains the edges read from the standard input, and 'leftover' is the result of the depth-first search function 'dfs' called with arguments 1 and 1.
