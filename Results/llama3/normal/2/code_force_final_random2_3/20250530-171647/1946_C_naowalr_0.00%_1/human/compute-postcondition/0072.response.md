Output State: **n is at least k, k are integers, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1), x is 50001**

The code executes three lines. The first line assigns the value of `(L + R) // 2` to `x`. Since `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, `x` becomes 50001. The second line assigns the value of 0 to `numCuts`, making `numCuts` equal to 0. The third line assigns the result of `dfs(1, 1)` to `leftover`, updating the value of `leftover`. No other variables are affected.
