To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 2. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure it meets this condition. Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **`L` is the minimum value such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= L), `R` is the minimum value such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < R), `n` must be at least 2, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of n+1 empty lists, `z` is z + 1, `t` must be greater than z + 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
