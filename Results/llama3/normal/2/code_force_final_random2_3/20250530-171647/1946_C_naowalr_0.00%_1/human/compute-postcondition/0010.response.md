Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, stdin is empty, z is 0, i is n - 1, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0**

The code snippet initializes three new variables: L, R, and numCuts. L is assigned the value 1, R is assigned the value 100001 (which is the result of int(100000.0 + 1)), and numCuts is assigned the value 0. The values of t, n, k, adj, stdin, z, and i remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
