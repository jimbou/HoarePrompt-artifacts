Output State: **n is at least 3, k are integers, L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than the maximum possible value of L plus 1, numCuts is 0, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, a and b are integers read from stdin, adj[a] contains b, adj[b] contains a, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1).**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to a and b. It then appends b to the list at index a in adj and appends a to the list at index b in adj. The values of n, k, L, R, numCuts, z, t, i, and leftover remain unchanged. The only modifications are to the adj list and the values of a and b.
