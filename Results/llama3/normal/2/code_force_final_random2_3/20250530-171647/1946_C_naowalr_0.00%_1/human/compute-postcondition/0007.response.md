To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of `n` + 1 lists where the a-th list contains `b` and the b-th list contains `a`, `stdin` is empty, `z` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `adj[a]` contains `b`, `adj[b]` contains `a`**
