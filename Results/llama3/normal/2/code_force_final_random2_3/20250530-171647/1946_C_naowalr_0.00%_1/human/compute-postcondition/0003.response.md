To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range is `n - 1`), and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of `n` + 1 empty lists, `stdin` is empty, `z` is 0, `i` is 0**
