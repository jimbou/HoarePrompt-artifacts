Postcondition: **L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than L + 1, numCuts is 0, n and k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists representing pairs (a, b), z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, and leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1). If numCuts is greater than k or numCuts equals k and leftover is greater than or equal to the average of L and R, then L is the average of the original L and R. Otherwise, R is the average of L and the original value of R.**
