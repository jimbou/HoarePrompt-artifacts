Output State: **L is the minimum value such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= L), R is the minimum value such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < R), n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is z + 1, t must be greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The minimum values L and R remain unchanged, the number of nodes n and the integer k also remain unchanged. The adjacency list adj now contains all the edges read from the standard input, where each edge is represented by a pair of nodes (a, b). The variable z has been incremented by 1, and t is still greater than z + 1. The standard input is empty, and the loop counter i has reached its final value of n - 1. The variables a and b hold the values of the last pair of integers read from the standard input.
