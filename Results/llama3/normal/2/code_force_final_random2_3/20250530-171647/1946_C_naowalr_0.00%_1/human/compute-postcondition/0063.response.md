The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is n - 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` are integers, `L` is either 1 or 50001, `R` is greater than the maximum possible value of `L` plus 1, `numCuts` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n+1` empty lists, `z` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than `z + 1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**
