Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is z + 1, t must be greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program's state after the if-else block execution is as follows: `L` is either 1 or 50001, `R` is either 50001 or 100001, `numCuts` is either 0 or greater than `k`, `n` and `k` are integers, `adj` is a list of n+1 lists representing pairs (a, b) read from stdin, `z` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than `z` + 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n` - 1, `a` and `b` are integers, `x` is 50001, and `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1). If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or equals `k` with `leftover` greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than 50001.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than L + 1, numCuts is 0, n and k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists representing pairs (a, b), z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, and leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1). If numCuts is greater than k or numCuts equals k and leftover is greater than or equal to the average of L and R, then L is the average of the original L and R. Otherwise, R is the average of L and the original value of R.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than the maximum possible value of L plus 1, numCuts is 0, n and k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists representing pairs (a, b), z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1). If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is the average of the initial L and R, and R is greater than the maximum possible value of the new L plus 1, and x is the average of the initial L and R. Otherwise, L is either 1 or 50001, R is the average of L and the maximum possible value of L plus 1, and x is the average of L and the maximum possible value of L plus 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
