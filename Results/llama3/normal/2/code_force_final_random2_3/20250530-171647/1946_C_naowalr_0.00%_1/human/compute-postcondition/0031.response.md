The only variable in the loop head is variable `z` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `z` and `t`. If `z` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is not specified, `t` is not specified. For the loop to execute again `z` must be increased by 1. So `z` is `z` + 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `z` + 1.
State: **L is the minimum value such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= L), and R is the minimum value such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < R), and the value of L is being printed, z is z + 1, t must be greater than z + 1**
