Postcondition: **The program's state after the if-else block execution is as follows: `L` is either 1 or 50001, `R` is either 50001 or 100001, `numCuts` is either 0 or greater than `k`, `n` and `k` are integers, `adj` is a list of n+1 lists representing pairs (a, b) read from stdin, `z` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than `z` + 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n` - 1, `a` and `b` are integers, `x` is 50001, and `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1). If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or equals `k` with `leftover` greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than 50001.**
