Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, x is the average of L and R, numCuts is 0, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1), L is either 1 or 50001, and R is the average of L and R.**

In this output state, the value of R has been updated to be equal to the average of L and R, which is the value of x. The other variables remain unchanged.
