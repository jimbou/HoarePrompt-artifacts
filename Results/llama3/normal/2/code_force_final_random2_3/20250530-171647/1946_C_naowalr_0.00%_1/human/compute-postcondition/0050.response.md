Output State: **`L` is the average of the original `L` and `R`, `R` is greater than `L` + 1, `numCuts` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers, `adj` is a list of `n+1` lists representing pairs `(a, b)`, `z` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than `z` + 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n` - 1, `a` and `b` are integers, `x` is the average of the original `L` and `R`, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.**

In this output state, the value of `L` has been updated to be the average of its original value and `R`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `R` still being greater than the new `L` + 1. The rest of the variables maintain their original values and properties.
