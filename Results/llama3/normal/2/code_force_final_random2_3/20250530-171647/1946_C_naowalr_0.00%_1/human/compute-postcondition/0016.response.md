Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, L is 1, R is 50001, numCuts is less than or equal to k and if numCuts equals k then leftover is less than 50001, x is 50001, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

In this output state, the value of R has been updated to 50001, which is the value of x. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state.
