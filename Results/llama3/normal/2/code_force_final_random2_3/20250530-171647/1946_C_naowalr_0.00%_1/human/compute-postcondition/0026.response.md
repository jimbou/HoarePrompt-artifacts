Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, x is (L + R) // 2, R is (L + R) // 2, numCuts is 0, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

In this output state, the value of R has been updated to be equal to x, which is (L + R) // 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
