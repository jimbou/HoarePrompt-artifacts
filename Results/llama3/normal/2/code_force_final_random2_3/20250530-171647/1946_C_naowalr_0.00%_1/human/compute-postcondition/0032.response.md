Output State: **L is the minimum value such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= L), R is the minimum value such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < R), n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n+1 empty lists, z is z + 1, t must be greater than z + 1, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to n and k, respectively. This operation empties stdin. The second line creates a list of n+1 empty lists and assigns it to adj. The values of L, R, z, and t are not affected by the code snippet. The value of L is still being printed, and z is still incremented by 1. The constraint that t must be greater than z + 1 remains valid.
