Output State: **L is either 1 or 50001, R is the average of L and the maximum possible value of L plus 1, numCuts is 0, n and k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists representing pairs (a, b), z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1), and x is the average of L and the maximum possible value of L plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of R has been updated to be the average of L and the maximum possible value of L plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the maximum possible value of L is 50001, so R is now the average of L and 50002.
