According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `R` and `L`. If `R - L` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `R` is 100001 and `L` is 1 or 50001. For the loop to be executed one more time, `R` must be greater than `L + 1`. So, `R` must be greater than 2 and `L` must be less than 99999.



State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, if the current value of numCuts is higher than k or equals k and the current value of leftover is higher or equal to 50001, then L is 50001 and R is 100001. Otherwise, L is 1 and R is 50001, x is 50001, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1), R must be greater than 2 and L must be less than 99999**
