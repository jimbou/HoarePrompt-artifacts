To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `R - L > 1`. The loop will execute if the difference between `R` and `L` is greater than 1.

Given the initial states:

- `t` is a positive integer
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the a-th list contains `b` and the b-th list contains `a` for all pairs `(a, b)` read from stdin
- `stdin` is empty
- `z` is 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001
- `numCuts` is 0

The only variables in the loop head are `R` and `L`. Since `R` is already greater than `L` by a large margin (`R` is 100001 and `L` is 1), the condition `R - L > 1` is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `R` and `L` or any other variables for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the a-th list contains `b` and the b-th list contains `a` for all pairs `(a, b)` read from stdin, `stdin` is empty, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**
