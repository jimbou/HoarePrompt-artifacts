Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: L is the minimum value such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= L), R is the minimum value such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < R), n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n+1 empty lists, z is z + 1, t must be greater than z + 1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj[a].append(b)
    adj[b].append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: L is the minimum value such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= L), R is the minimum value such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < R), n must be at least 2, k is an integer, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is z + 1, t must be greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: L is the minimum value such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= L), R is the minimum value such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < R), n must be at least 3, k is an integer, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is z + 1, t must be greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, a and b are assigned the values of the two integers from stdin, adj[a] contains b, adj[b] contains a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: L is the minimum value such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= L), R is the minimum value such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < R), n must be at least 3, k is an integer, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is z + 1, t must be greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, a is an integer, b is an integer, adj[a] contains b, adj[b] contains a, a and b are assigned the values of the two integers from stdin.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
