Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer and must be at least 3, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a, stdin is empty, z is 0, i is 2, a is an integer, b is an integer, adj[a] contains b, adj[b] contains a, adj[a] contains b, adj[b] contains a**

The code snippet assigns the values of `a` and `b` from the input to the variables `a` and `b`, and then appends `b` to `adj[a]` and `a` to `adj[b]`. Since `a` and `b` are already present in each other's adjacency lists, this results in duplicate entries. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
