Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, `z` is z + 1, `t` must be greater than z + 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is n - 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1), `numCuts` is less than or equal to k and if numCuts equals k then leftover is less than 50001.**

In this output state, the value of `R` has been updated to 50001, which is the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged, and their previous conditions and relationships still hold.
