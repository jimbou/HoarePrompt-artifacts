Postcondition: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, if the current value of numCuts is higher than k or equals k and the current value of leftover is higher or equal to 50001, then L is 50001 and R is 100001. Otherwise, L is 1 and R is 50001, x is 50001, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1).**
