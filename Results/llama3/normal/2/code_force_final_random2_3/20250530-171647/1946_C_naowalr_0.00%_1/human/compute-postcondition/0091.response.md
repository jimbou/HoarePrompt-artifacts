Output State: **L is the minimum value such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= L), and R is the minimum value such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < R), and the value of L is being printed, and z equals t, and stdin is empty.**

This output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the value of L is the minimum value such that the number of cuts is greater than k or the number of cuts is equal to k and the leftover is greater than or equal to L. The value of R is the minimum value such that the number of cuts is less than or equal to k and the leftover is less than R. The value of L is being printed, and the loop counter z is equal to the number of test cases t. The standard input stdin is empty, indicating that all the input has been read.
