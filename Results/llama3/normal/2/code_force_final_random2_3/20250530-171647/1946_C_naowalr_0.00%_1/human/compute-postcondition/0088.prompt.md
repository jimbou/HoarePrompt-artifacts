Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is at least n, k are integers, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1).
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is at least k, k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers. If the current value of numCuts is greater than k or the current value of numCuts equals k and the current value of leftover is greater than or equal to x, then L is x and R is 100001. Otherwise, L is 1 and R is 50001, and numCuts is less than or equal to k and (numCuts is not equal to k or leftover is less than x).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is at least k, k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, R is greater than L + 1, x is (L + R) // 2, numCuts is 0, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1). If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is (L + R) // 2. Otherwise, R is equal to (L + R) // 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is at least k, k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, x is (L + R) // 2, numCuts is 0, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1). If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is (L + R) // 2. Otherwise, R is equal to (L + R) // 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
