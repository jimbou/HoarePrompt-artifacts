Output State: **L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than L + 1, numCuts is 0, n and k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists representing pairs (a, b), z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, x is the average of L and R, and leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1).**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be the average of `L` and `R`, and `numCuts` has been reset to 0. The value of `leftover` has also been updated to be the result of the function `dfs(1, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
