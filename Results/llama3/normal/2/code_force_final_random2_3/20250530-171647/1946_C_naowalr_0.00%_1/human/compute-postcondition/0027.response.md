Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, numCuts is 0, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1). If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is updated to (L + R) // 2. Otherwise, R is updated to (L + R) // 2.***
