To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **n is at least 3, k are integers, L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than the maximum possible value of L plus 1, numCuts is 0, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1), a and b are integers read from stdin, adj[a] contains b, adj[b] contains a.**
