Output State: **n is at least k, k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, R is (L + R) // 2, numCuts is 0, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1), x is (L + R) // 2. If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is (L + R) // 2. Otherwise, R is equal to (L + R) // 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of R has been updated to be equal to x, which is the average of L and R. All other variables remain unchanged, with n being at least k, adj being a list of n+1 lists representing a graph, z being incremented by 1, t being greater than z + 1, stdin being empty, i being n - 1, a and b being integers, numCuts being 0, leftover being the result of dfs(1, 1), and x being the average of L and R. The conditions for updating L and R based on numCuts, k, and leftover still hold.
