Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and k are integers, L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than the maximum possible value of L plus 1, numCuts is 0, adj is a list of n+1 empty lists, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1). If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is the average of the initial L and R, and R is greater than the maximum possible value of the new L plus 1, and x is the average of the initial L and R. Otherwise, L is either 1 or 50001, R is the average of L and the maximum possible value of L plus 1, and x is the average of L and the maximum possible value of L plus 1. and the value of L which is either 1 or 50001 is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj[a].append(b)
    adj[b].append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least 2, k are integers, L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than the maximum possible value of L plus 1, numCuts is 0, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is 0, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 3, k are integers, L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than the maximum possible value of L plus 1, numCuts is 0, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1), a and b are integers read from stdin, adj[a] contains b, adj[b] contains a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is at least 3, k are integers, L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than the maximum possible value of L plus 1, numCuts is 0, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, a and b are integers read from stdin, adj[a] contains b, adj[b] contains a, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
