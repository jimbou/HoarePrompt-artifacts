Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer and must be at least 2, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a, stdin is empty, z is 0, i is 0, a is an integer, b is an integer**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since stdin is empty, this operation does not change the state of stdin. The code then appends `b` to the `a-th` list in `adj` and appends `a` to the `b-th` list in `adj`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `z`, and `i` are not affected by the code. The code introduces two new variables `a` and `b`, which are integers.
