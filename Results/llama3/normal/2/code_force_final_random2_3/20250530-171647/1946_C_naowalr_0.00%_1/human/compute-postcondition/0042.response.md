Output State: **L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is z + 1, t must be greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, x is 50001, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1).**

The code executes in the following way: The first line assigns the value of `(L + R) // 2` to `x`. Since `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, `x` becomes 50001. The second line assigns the value of 0 to `numCuts`. The third line assigns the result of `dfs(1, 1)` to `leftover`. The value of `leftover` is not specified, as it depends on the implementation of the `dfs` function, which is not provided. No other variables are affected.
