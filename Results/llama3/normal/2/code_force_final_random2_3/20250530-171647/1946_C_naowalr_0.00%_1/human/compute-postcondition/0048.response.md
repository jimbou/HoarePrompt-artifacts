The variables in the loop head are `R` and `L`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the difference between `R` and `L`. If `R` - `L` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `R` - `L` is either 50000 or 49999. For the loop to execute again, `R` - `L` must be greater than 1. Since `R` - `L` is either 50000 or 49999, we need to adjust `R` - `L` to be greater than 1. This can be achieved by adjusting `R` to be greater than `L` + 1.

State: **`L` is either 1 or 50001, `R` is greater than `L` + 1, `numCuts` is either 0 or greater than `k`, `n` and `k` are integers, `adj` is a list of n+1 lists representing pairs (a, b) read from stdin, `z` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than `z` + 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n` - 1, `a` and `b` are integers, `x` is 50001, and `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**
