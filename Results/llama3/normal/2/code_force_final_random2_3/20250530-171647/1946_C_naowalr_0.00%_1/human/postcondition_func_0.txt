This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the minimum value L such that the number of cuts (numCuts) is greater than a given integer k or (numCuts equals k and the leftover value is greater than or equal to L). The function iterates through multiple test cases, where each test case involves reading the number of vertices (n) and a non-negative integer k, constructing an adjacency list for a tree, and performing a binary search to find the minimum value L. The function prints the value of L for each test case.
