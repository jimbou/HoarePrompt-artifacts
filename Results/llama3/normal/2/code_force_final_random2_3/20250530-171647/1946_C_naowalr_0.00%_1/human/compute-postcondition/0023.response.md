The variables in the loop head are R and L, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables R and L. If R - L > 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, R - L is not greater than 1, so it needs to be adjusted to R - L > 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of `n` + 1 lists where the a-th list contains `b` and the b-th list contains `a` for all pairs (`a`, `b`) read from stdin, `z` is 0, `i` is `n` - 1, `x` is the average of `L` and `R`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, R - L > 1**
