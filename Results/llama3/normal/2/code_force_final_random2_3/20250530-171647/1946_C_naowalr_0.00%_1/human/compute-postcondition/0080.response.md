Output State: **`n` is at least `k`, `k` are integers, `adj` is a list of `n+1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` and the list at index `b` contains `a`, `z` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than `z + 1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are integers, `R` is greater than `L + 1`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `L` is `(L + R) // 2`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `adj`, `z`, `t`, `stdin`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `R`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` remain unchanged. The only change is that `L` is now assigned the value of `x`, which is the average of `L` and `R`.
