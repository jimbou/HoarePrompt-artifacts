The variables in the loop head are R and L, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables R and L. If R - L is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, R is greater than L + 1, so for the loop to be executed one more time, R must be greater than L + 2.

State: **n is at least k, k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, R is greater than L + 2, x is (L + R) // 2, numCuts is 0, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1). If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is (L + R) // 2. Otherwise, R is equal to (L + R) // 2.**
