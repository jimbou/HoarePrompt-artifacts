Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, stdin is empty, z is 0, i is n - 1, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, x is 50001, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

The code assigns the value of `(L + R) // 2` to `x`, making `x` equal to 50001. It then resets `numCuts` to 0. The third line assigns the result of the function call `dfs(1, 1)` to `leftover`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `stdin`, `z`, `i`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged.
