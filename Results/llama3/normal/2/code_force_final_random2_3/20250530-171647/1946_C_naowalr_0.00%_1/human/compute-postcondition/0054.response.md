Output State: **L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than the maximum possible value of L plus 1, numCuts is 0, n and k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists representing pairs (a, b), z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1), and x is the average of L and R.**

The code executes three lines. The first line calculates the average of L and R and assigns it to x. Since L is either 1 or 50001 and R is greater than the maximum possible value of L plus 1, the average will be a value between L and R. The second line resets numCuts to 0. The third line reassigns the result of dfs(1, 1) to leftover. The values of n, k, adj, z, t, stdin, i, a, and b remain unchanged.
