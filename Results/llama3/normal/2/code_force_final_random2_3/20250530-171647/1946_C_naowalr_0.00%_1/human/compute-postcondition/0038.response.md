Output State: **L is the minimum value such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= L), R is the minimum value such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < R), n must be at least 3, k is an integer, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is z + 1, t must be greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, a is an integer, b is an integer, adj[a] contains b, adj[b] contains a, a and b are assigned the values of the two integers from stdin.**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of L, R, n, k, z, t, i, or stdin. The only changes are to the values of a and b, which are assigned the values of the two integers from stdin, and the lists adj[a] and adj[b], which are appended with the values of b and a, respectively.
