Output State: **L is either 1 or 50001, R is the average of L and the original value of R, numCuts is 0, n and k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists representing pairs (a, b), z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, x is the average of L and the original value of R, and leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1).**

In this output state, the value of R has been updated to be the average of L and the original value of R. The original value of R was greater than L + 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
