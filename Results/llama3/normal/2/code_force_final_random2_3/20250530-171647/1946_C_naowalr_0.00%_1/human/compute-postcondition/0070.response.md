Output State: **n is at least n, k are integers, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1).**

The code snippet assigns the value 1 to L and the value 100001 to R. The value of numCuts is set to 0. No other variables are affected by the code. The state of all other variables remains the same as in the initial state.
