Output: **L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than the maximum possible value of L plus 1, numCuts is 0, n and k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists representing pairs (a, b), z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1). If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is the average of the initial L and R, and R is greater than the maximum possible value of the new L plus 1, and x is the average of the initial L and R. Otherwise, L is either 1 or 50001, R is the average of L and the maximum possible value of L plus 1, and x is the average of L and the maximum possible value of L plus 1. and the value of L which is either 1 or 50001 is being printed**
