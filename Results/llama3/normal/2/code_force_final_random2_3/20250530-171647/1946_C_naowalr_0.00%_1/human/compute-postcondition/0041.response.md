To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `R - L > 1` and adjust the states of `R` and `L` accordingly.

Given the initial states:
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001

The condition `R - L > 1` must be true for the loop to execute. Let's calculate the difference:
- `R - L` = 100001 - 1 = 100000

Since 100000 is indeed greater than 1, the initial states of `R` and `L` already satisfy the condition. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `R` and `L`.

However, to explicitly state the condition that allows the loop to execute, we can say that `R` must be greater than `L + 1`. Given the initial values, this condition is already met.

State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n+1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` and the list at index `b` contains `a` for all pairs `(a, b)` read from stdin, `z` is `z + 1`, `t` must be greater than `z + 1`, stdin is empty, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer**
