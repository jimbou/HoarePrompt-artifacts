Output State: **L is 50001, R is 100001, the current value of numCuts is greater than k or equals k, the current value of leftover is greater than or equal to 50001, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is z + 1, t must be greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, x is 50001, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1).**

In this output state, the value of L has been updated to 50001, which is the value of x. The other variables remain unchanged, and their previous values and conditions are still valid.
