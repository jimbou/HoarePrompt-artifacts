To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `R` and `L`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `R - L > 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `L` is either 1 or `x`, and `R` is either 50001 or 100001.

To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `R - L > 1`. If `L` is 1, then `R` must be greater than 2. If `L` is `x`, then `R` must be greater than `x + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `x`, we can't determine the exact value of `R`. However, we can conclude that `R` must be greater than `L + 1`.

State: **n is at least k, k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, R is greater than L + 1**
