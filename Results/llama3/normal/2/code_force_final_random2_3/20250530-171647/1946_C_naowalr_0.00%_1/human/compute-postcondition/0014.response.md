Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of `n` + 1 lists where the a-th list contains `b` and the b-th list contains `a` for all pairs (`a`, `b`) read from stdin, `z` is 0, `i` is `n` - 1, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, the current value of `numCuts` is either higher than `k` or equals `k` and the current value of `leftover` is higher or equal to 50001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

In this output state, the value of `L` has been updated to 50001, which is the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
