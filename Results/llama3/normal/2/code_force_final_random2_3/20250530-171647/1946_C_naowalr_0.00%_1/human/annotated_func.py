#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of lists where each inner list represents the adjacency list of a vertex in the tree, and the input is provided in the format specified in the problem description.
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for z in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        
        adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        L = 1
        
        R = int(100000.0 + 1)
        
        numCuts = 0
        
        while R - L > 1:
            x = (L + R) // 2
            numCuts = 0
            leftover = dfs(1, 1)
            if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
                L = x
            else:
                R = x
        
        print(L)
        
    #State: L is the minimum value such that numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= L), and R is the minimum value such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < R), and the value of L is being printed, and z equals t, and stdin is empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the minimum value L such that the number of cuts (numCuts) is greater than a given integer k or (numCuts equals k and the leftover value is greater than or equal to L). The function iterates through multiple test cases, where each test case involves reading the number of vertices (n) and a non-negative integer k, constructing an adjacency list for a tree, and performing a binary search to find the minimum value L. The function prints the value of L for each test case.
