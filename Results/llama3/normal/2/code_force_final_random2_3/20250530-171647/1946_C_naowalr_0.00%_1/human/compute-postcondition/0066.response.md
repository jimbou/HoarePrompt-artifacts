Output State: **n is at least 3, k are integers, L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than the maximum possible value of L plus 1, numCuts is 0, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1), a and b are integers read from stdin, adj[a] contains b, adj[b] contains a.**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to a and b. Since stdin is empty, this operation does not change the state of stdin. The code then appends b to the list at index a in adj and appends a to the list at index b in adj. This modifies the state of adj. The values of n, k, L, R, numCuts, z, t, i, and leftover remain unchanged.
