Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of lists where each inner list represents the adjacency list of a vertex in the tree, and stdin contains one less input: the first input has been read and assigned to `t`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to the integer value read from the first input, and the stdin now contains one less input. The values of `n`, `k`, and `adj` remain unchanged.
