Output State: **L is either 1 or 50001, R is greater than the maximum possible value of L plus 1, numCuts is 0, n and k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists representing pairs (a, b), z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1). If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is the average of the initial L and R, and R is greater than the maximum possible value of the new L plus 1, and x is the average of the initial L and R. Otherwise, L is either 1 or 50001, R is the average of L and the maximum possible value of L plus 1, and x is the average of L and the maximum possible value of L plus 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `L` is either 1 or 50001, `R` is greater than the maximum possible value of `L` plus 1, `numCuts` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers, `adj` is a list of `n+1` lists representing pairs `(a, b)`, `z` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than `z` + 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n` - 1, `a` and `b` are integers, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or equals `k` with `leftover` greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is the average of the initial `L` and `R`, and `R` is greater than the maximum possible value of the new `L` plus 1, and `x` is the average of the initial `L` and `R`. Otherwise, `L` is either 1 or 50001, `R` is the average of `L` and the maximum possible value of `L` plus 1, and `x` is the average of `L` and the maximum possible value of `L` plus 1.
