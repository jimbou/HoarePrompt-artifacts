The first line assigns the integer values of the next two inputs from stdin to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since stdin contains one less input, it is now empty. The second line creates a list of empty lists, where the number of inner lists is `n + 1`, and assigns it to `adj`. The third line does not affect any variables.

Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 empty lists, stdin is empty, z is 0**
