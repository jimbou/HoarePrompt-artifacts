Postcondition: ***n is at least k, k are integers, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a, z is incremented by 1, t is greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a and b are integers. If the current value of numCuts is greater than k or the current value of numCuts equals k and the current value of leftover is greater than or equal to x, then L is x and R is 100001. Otherwise, L is 1 and R is 50001, and numCuts is less than or equal to k and (numCuts is not equal to k or leftover is less than x).***
