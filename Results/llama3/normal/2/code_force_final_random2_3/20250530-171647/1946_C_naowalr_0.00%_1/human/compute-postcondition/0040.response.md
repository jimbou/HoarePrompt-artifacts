Output State: **L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, adj is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b and the list at index b contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is z + 1, t must be greater than z + 1, stdin is empty, i is n - 1, a is an integer, b is an integer.**

The code snippet assigns new values to L, R, and numCuts. L is set to 1, R is set to 100001 (which is the minimum value such that numCuts <= k and (numCuts < k or leftover < R)), and numCuts is initialized to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
