Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of `n` + 1 lists where the a-th list contains `b` and the b-th list contains `a` for all pairs (`a`, `b`) read from stdin, `z` is 0, `i` is `n` - 1, `x` is the average of `L` and `R`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `x`), then `L` is the average of `L` and `R`, and `R` is either 1 and 50001 or 50001 and 100001 depending on the previous values of `numCuts` and `leftover`. Otherwise, `L` is either 1 or 50001, and `R` is the average of `L` and `R`.**
