Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, stdin is empty, z is 0, i is n - 1, L is 1, R is 100001, numCuts is 0
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, if the current value of numCuts is higher than k or equals k and the current value of leftover is higher or equal to 50001, then L is 50001 and R is 100001. Otherwise, L is 1 and R is 50001, x is 50001, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of `n` + 1 lists where the a-th list contains `b` and the b-th list contains `a` for all pairs (`a`, `b`) read from stdin, `z` is 0, `i` is `n` - 1, `x` is the average of `L` and `R`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `x`), then `L` is the average of `L` and `R`, and `R` is either 1 and 50001 or 50001 and 100001 depending on the previous values of `numCuts` and `leftover`. Otherwise, `L` is either 1 or 50001, and `R` is the average of `L` and `R`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, numCuts is 0, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1). If numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), then L is updated to (L + R) // 2. Otherwise, R is updated to (L + R) // 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
