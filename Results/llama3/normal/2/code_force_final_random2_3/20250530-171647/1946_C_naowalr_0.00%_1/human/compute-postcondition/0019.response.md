Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, z is 0, i is n - 1, x is the average of L and R, numCuts is 0, leftover is the result of dfs(1, 1), L and R are either 1 and 50001 or 50001 and 100001 depending on the previous values of numCuts and leftover.**

The code executes three lines. The first line assigns the average of L and R to x. Since L and R are either 1 and 50001 or 50001 and 100001, x becomes either 25001 or 75001. The second line assigns 0 to numCuts. The third line assigns the result of dfs(1, 1) to leftover. The values of t, n, k, adj, z, and i remain unchanged.
