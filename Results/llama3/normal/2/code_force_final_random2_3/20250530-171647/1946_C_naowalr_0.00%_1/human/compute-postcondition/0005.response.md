The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must be at least 2.
State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer and must be at least 2, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a, stdin is empty, z is 0, i is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer**
