Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `adj` is a list of `n` + 1 lists where the a-th list contains `b` and the b-th list contains `a` for all pairs (`a`, `b`) read from stdin, `z` is 0, `i` is `n` - 1, `x` is the average of `L` and `R`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is the average of `L` and `R`, and `R` is either 1 and 50001 or 50001 and 100001 depending on the previous values of `numCuts` and `leftover`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `z`, `i`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` remain unchanged. The value of `L` is updated to be the average of its previous value and `R`, which means it now holds the same value as `x`. The value of `R` remains the same, which is either 1 and 50001 or 50001 and 100001 depending on the previous values of `numCuts` and `leftover`.
