Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, adj is a list of n + 1 lists where the a-th list contains b and the b-th list contains a for all pairs (a, b) read from stdin, stdin is empty, z is 0, i is n - 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the adjacency list `adj` has been populated with all the edges read from the standard input, and the loop counter `i` has reached its final value of `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
