Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `s` is a string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s` and is increased by 1, `lst` is a list containing the values `i + 1` where `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is 2, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element equals `mini`, `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, and `one` is `one + 1` if `s[i]` is not '0'. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains an additional element which is `i + 1`.**

The code increments the value of `zero` by 1, which affects the value of `zero_perc`. The other variables remain unchanged.
