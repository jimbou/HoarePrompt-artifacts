Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 3, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s` plus 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `z` is the count of '0' in `s` plus 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, if `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`, then `lst` is a list containing the value `i + 1`, otherwise `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1**
