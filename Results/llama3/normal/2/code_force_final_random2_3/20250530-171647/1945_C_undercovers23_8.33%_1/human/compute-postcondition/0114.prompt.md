Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is `n` - len(`lst`), `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `final` is an empty list, `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing 0. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing the value `n`. The first element of the `final` list is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is `n` - len(`lst`), `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `final` is a list containing either 0 or `n`, `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`, `elem` is the first element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then the first element of `lst` is added to `final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is `n` - len(`lst`) - 1, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `final` is a list containing either 0 or `n` or `n` and the second element in `lst`, `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`, `elem` is the second element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then the second element of `lst` is added to `final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is `n` - len(`lst`) - 1, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `final` is a list containing either 0 or `n` or `n` and the second element in `lst` and the third element in `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`, `elem` is the third element in `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
