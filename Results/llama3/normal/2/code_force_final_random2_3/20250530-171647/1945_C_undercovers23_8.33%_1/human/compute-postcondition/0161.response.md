According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in `lst`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `ele` is the third element in the list.
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `lst` is a list of indices that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the count of '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`n - 1`)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 1), `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.**
