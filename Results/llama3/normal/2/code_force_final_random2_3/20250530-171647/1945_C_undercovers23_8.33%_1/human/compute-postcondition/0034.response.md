To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `lst`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If `lst` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. 

At the start of the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, which means `n` must be at least 2 for `i` to be at least 0. Since `lst` contains values `i + 1` where `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`, `lst` must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `s` is a string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`, `one` is the count of '1' in `s`, `lst` is a list containing the values `i + 1` where `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` and must have at least 1 element, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is `n - 2`, `ele` is the first element in `lst`**
