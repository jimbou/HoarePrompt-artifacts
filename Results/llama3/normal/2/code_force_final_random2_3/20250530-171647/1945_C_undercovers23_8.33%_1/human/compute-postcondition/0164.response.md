Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `lst` is an empty list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the count of '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`n - 1`)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 1), `mini` is the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `final` is an empty list.**

The code creates a new empty list called `final`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `final` list is added to the output state as an empty list.
