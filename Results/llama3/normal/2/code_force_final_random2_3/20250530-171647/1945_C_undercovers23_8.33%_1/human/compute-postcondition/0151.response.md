Output State: **`lst` is a list, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 2)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((o - one - 1) * 100 / (n - i - 2)), `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `one` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `one` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `one_perc` is now calculated based on the updated value of `one`. The rest of the variables, including `lst`, `zero_perc`, `i`, and `n`, retain their original values and properties.
