Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer and must be greater than i, s is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the count of '1' in s, z is the count of '0' in s, zero is the count of '0' in s, one is the count of '1' in s, lst is a list containing the values i + 1 where zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50, mini is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between n // 2 and all elements in lst, i is n - len(lst), ele is the last element in lst, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst where the absolute difference between n // 2 and the element equals mini. If c1 is greater than or equal to 50, final is a list containing 0. Otherwise, final is a list containing the value n. The first element of the final list is being printed, pk is n // 2.**

In this output state, the value of pk has been updated to n // 2, which is the integer division of n by 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state. The first element of the final list is being printed, which depends on the value of c1 and the elements in lst.
