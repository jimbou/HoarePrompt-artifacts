Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is at least 3, s is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the count of '1' in s plus 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it remains the same, z is the count of '0' in s plus 2 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, zero_perc is the ceiling of (z * 100) / (i + 1), one_perc is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100) / (n - i - 1), lst is a list containing the value i + 1, mini is 100000000, i is 2, and one is increased by 1 if s[i] is '1'.**

The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is 2, the value appended to `lst` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
