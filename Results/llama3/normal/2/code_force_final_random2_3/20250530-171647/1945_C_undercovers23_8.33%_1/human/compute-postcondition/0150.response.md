The value of `zero` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. `lst` is still a list, `zero_perc` is still the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 2)), `one_perc` is still the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 2)), `i` is still `i + 2`, and `n` is still greater than `i + 2`. The value of `zero` is now `zero + 1`. 

Output State: **`lst` is a list, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of ((zero + 1) * 100 / (i + 2)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 2)), `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `zero` is `zero + 1`.**
