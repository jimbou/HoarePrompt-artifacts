Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the position of the house after which the road should be laid. It iterates through the string `s` and keeps track of the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the road. It checks if the condition of having at least half of the residents on each side satisfied with the choice is met, and if so, it adds the current position to the list `lst`. Finally, it finds the position with the minimum absolute difference from the middle of the village and outputs it.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including when the number of houses is even or odd, and when the road should be laid before the first house or after the last house. The use of `math.ceil` to calculate the percentage of satisfied residents on each side ensures that the condition is met correctly.

The program also correctly handles the case when there are multiple suitable positions with the minimum absolute difference from the middle of the village, by finding the smallest one.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
