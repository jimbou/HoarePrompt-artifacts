Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`. If `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, then `lst` is a list containing the values `i + 1` where `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is 2, `ele` is the last element in `lst` which is now `i + 1`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element equals `mini`.***
