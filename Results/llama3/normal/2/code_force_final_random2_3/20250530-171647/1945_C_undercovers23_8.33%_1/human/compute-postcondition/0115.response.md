Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `ele` is not defined, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing either 0 or `n` or `n` and some elements from `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`, `elem` is not defined.**

The code sorts the list `final` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
