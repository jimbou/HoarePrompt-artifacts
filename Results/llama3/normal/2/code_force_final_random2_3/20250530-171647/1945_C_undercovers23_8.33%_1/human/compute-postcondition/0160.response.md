Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `lst` is a list of indices that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the count of '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`n - 1`)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 1), `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `i`, `lst`, `ele`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged. The value of `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.
