To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is the number of test cases and stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases**
