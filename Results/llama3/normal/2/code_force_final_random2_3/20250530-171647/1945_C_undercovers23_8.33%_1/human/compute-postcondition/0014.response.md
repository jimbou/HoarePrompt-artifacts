Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. Otherwise, `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1.***
