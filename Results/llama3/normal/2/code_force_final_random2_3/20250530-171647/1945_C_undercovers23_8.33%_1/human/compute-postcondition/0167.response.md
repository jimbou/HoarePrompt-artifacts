Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the count of '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`n - 1`)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 1), `mini` is the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains `n - 1`. The list `lst` still has at least one element. The value of `elem` is still the first element in the list. The value of `ele` is still the last element in the original list. The counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2` remain the same. The percentages of '0' and '1' also remain the same. The value of `mini` is still the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and all elements in `lst`. The list `final` now contains the first element of `lst`.
