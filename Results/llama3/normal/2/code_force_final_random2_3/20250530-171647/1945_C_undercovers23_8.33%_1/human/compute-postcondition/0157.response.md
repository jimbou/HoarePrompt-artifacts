To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `lst`. The loop will execute if `lst` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `lst` to have at least one element, and `ele` will be the first element in `lst`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `lst` is a list of indices that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the count of '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`n - 1`)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 1)**
