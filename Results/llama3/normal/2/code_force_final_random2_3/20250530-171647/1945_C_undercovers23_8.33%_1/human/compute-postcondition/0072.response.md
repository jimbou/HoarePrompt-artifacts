Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `s` is a string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s` and equals `zero` + 1, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the values `i + 1` where `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is 0, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element equals `mini`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing 0. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing the value `n`. The first element of the `final` list is being printed. `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`. The current value of `s[i]` is '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `zero` has been incremented by 1, and it is now 1. The count of '0' in string `s` is also incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
