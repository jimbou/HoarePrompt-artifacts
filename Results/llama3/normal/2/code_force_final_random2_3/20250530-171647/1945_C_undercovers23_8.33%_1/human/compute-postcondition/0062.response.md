Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the first element of the `final` list.

The `final` list contains elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element equals `mini`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing 0. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing the value `n`.

Since `final` is a sorted list, the first element `final[0]` will be the smallest value in the list.

Output: **The smallest value in the final list, which is either 0 if c1 is greater than or equal to 50, or n if c1 is less than 50**
