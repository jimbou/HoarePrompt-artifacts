The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `elem`. If `elem` is the second element in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the first element in the list, `lst` has at least 1 element. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `elem` is the second element in the list.
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `lst` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the count of '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`n - 1`)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 1), `mini` is the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and all elements in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`. Otherwise, `final` remains an empty list.**
