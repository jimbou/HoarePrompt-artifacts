Output State: **`lst` is a list with an additional element `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 1)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)), `zero` and `one` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `lst` now has an additional element which is the current value of `i` plus one. The value of `i` is still two more than its original value. The value of `n` is still greater than `i` plus two. The percentages `zero_perc` and `one_perc` remain the same, calculated based on the original values of `zero`, `one`, `i`, `n`, and `o`. The values of `zero` and `one` have not changed.
