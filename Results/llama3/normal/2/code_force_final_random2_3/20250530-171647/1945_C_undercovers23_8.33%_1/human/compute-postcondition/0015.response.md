Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is at least 2, s is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the count of '1' in s, z is the count of '0' in s, lst is an empty list, mini is 100000000, i is 0, zero_perc is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 1)), one_perc is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)).**

The code calculates the percentage of zeros and ones in the string `s` up to the current index `i` and from the current index `i` to the end of the string, respectively. The `zero_perc` variable is assigned the ceiling of the product of `zero` and 100 divided by `i + 1`, while the `one_perc` variable is assigned the ceiling of the product of `o - one` and 100 divided by `n - i - 1`. The values of `zero` and `one` are determined by the character at index `i` of string `s`. If the character is '0', then `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0; otherwise, `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1.
