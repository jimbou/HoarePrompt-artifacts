Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an even integer, `s` is a string, `pk` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `pk` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by 2, which is an integer since `n` is even. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
