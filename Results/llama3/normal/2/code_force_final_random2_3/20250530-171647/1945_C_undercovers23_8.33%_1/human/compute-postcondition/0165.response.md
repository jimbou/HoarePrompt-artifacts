The only objects in the loop head are variables  elem and list  lst, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lst.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, lst is empty. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the elem is the first element in the list.
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the count of '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`n - 1`)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 1), `mini` is the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `final` is an empty list**
