Output State: **`zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `one` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `one` has been increased by 1, while the values of `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The relationship between `n` and `i` is still valid, with `n` being greater than `i + 1`.
