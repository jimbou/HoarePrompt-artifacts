Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `lst` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the count of '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`n - 1`)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 1), `mini` is the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and all elements in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`, the second element of `lst`, and the third element of `lst`. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing the second element of `lst` and the third element of `lst`.***
