The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs, the first input is an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 3*10^5). Therefore, the value of `t` is equal to the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.**
