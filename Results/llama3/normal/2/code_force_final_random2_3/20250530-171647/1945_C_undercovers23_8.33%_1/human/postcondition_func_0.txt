This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It calculates the percentage of 0s and 1s in the string and finds the indices where the percentage of 0s is at least 50% and the percentage of 1s is at least 50% in the remaining string. If such indices exist, it finds the index that is closest to the middle of the string and prints it. If no such indices exist, it prints 0 if the percentage of 1s in the entire string is at least 50%, and n otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the results.
