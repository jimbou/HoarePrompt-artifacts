Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 3, `s` is a string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s` plus 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `z` is the count of '0' in `s` plus 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `(z * 100) / (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `((o - one) * 100) / (n - i - 1)`, `lst` is a list containing the value `i + 1` if `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, otherwise it is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `z` has increased by 1, and the value of `zero_perc` has also changed due to the increase in `z`. The other variables remain unchanged.
