The only object in the loop head is variable  ele and list lst, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lst.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, lst has at least 2 elements, ele is the second element in the list, i is n - 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the ele is the third element in the list and i is n - 3.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `s` is a string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`, `one` is the count of '1' in `s`, `lst` is a list containing the values `i + 1` where `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` and must have at least 3 elements, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ele` is the third element in `lst`.**
