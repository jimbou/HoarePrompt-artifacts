Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `ele` is not defined, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `final` is a list containing 0, `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`, `elem` is not defined, `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 1, `n` is still an integer and greater than `i`, `s` is still a string, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is still a list of characters in `s`, `o` is still the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is still the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is still 0, `one` is still 0, `lst` is still an empty list, `i` is still `n`, `ele` is still not defined, `mini` is still the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `final` now contains 0, `pk` is still `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is still `n // 2`, `elem` is still not defined, and `c1` is still `o * 100 // n` and its value is still greater than or equal to 50.
