Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `zero_perc` is the ceiling of ((zero + 1) * 100 / (i + 2)) and `zero` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((o - one - 1) * 100 / (n - i - 2)) and `one` is increased by 1.***
