Output State: **`zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0, `lst` has an additional element which is `i + 1`, and the current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.**

In this output state, the values of `zero_perc` and `one_perc` remain unchanged. The list `lst` has been modified by appending the value of `i + 1`. The conditions that `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 are still valid.
