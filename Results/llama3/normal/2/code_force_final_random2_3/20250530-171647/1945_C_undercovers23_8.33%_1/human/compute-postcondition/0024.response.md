Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 3, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s` plus 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `z` is the count of '0' in `s` plus 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `(z * 100) / (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is the ceiling of `((o - one) * 100) / (n - i - 1)`, `lst` is a list containing the value `i + 1`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `lst` has been updated to include the value `i + 1`, which is 2, regardless of the values of `zero_perc` and `one_perc`. The other variables remain unchanged.
