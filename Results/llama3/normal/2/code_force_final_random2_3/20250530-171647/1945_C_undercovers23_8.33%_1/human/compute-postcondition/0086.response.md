Postcondition: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer and must be greater than 1, s is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the count of '1' in s, z is the count of '0' in s, lst is a list containing the values i + 1 where zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50, mini is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between pk and all elements in lst, i is 1, ele is the last element in lst, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst where the absolute difference between pk and the element equals mini, pk is n // 2 if n is even, otherwise pk is n // 2, zero_perc is math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)), one_perc is math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)), and one is one + 1 if s[i] is not '0'. If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then lst contains an additional element which is i + 1.**
