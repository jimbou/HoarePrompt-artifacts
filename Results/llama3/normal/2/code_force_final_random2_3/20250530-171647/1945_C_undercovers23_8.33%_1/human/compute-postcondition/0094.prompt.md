Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 1, n is an integer and must be greater than i, s is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the count of '1' in s, z is the count of '0' in s, zero is 0, one is 0, lst is a list containing the values i + 1 where zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50, mini is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between pk and all elements in lst, i is n - len(lst), ele is the last element in lst, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst where the absolute difference between pk and the element equals mini. If c1 is greater than or equal to 50, final is a list containing 0. Otherwise, final is a list containing the value n. The first element of the final list is being printed. pk is n // 2 if n is even, otherwise pk is n // 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 1, n is an integer and must be greater than 1, s is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the count of '1' in s, z is the count of '0' in s. If s[i] is '0', z equals zero + 1 and zero is 1. Otherwise, z equals zero and one is 1. lst is a list containing the values i + 1 where zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50, mini is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between pk and all elements in lst, i is 0, ele is the last element in lst, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst where the absolute difference between pk and the element equals mini. If c1 is greater than or equal to 50, final is a list containing 0. Otherwise, final is a list containing the value n. The first element of the final list is being printed. pk is n // 2 if n is even, otherwise pk is n // 2. zero_perc is math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)), one_perc is math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)). If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, lst contains the value i + 1. Otherwise, lst does not contain the value i + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 1, n is an integer and must be greater than 1, s is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the count of '1' in s, z is the count of '0' in s, lst is a list containing the values i + 1 where zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50, mini is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between pk and all elements in lst, i is 1, ele is the last element in lst, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst where the absolute difference between pk and the element equals mini, pk is n // 2 if n is even, otherwise pk is n // 2, zero_perc is math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)), one_perc is math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)), and one is one + 1 if s[i] is not '0'. If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then lst contains an additional element which is i + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`. If `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, then `lst` is a list containing the values `i + 1` where `zero_perc` >= 50 and `one_perc` >= 50, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is 2, `ele` is the last element in `lst` which is now `i + 1`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element equals `mini`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
