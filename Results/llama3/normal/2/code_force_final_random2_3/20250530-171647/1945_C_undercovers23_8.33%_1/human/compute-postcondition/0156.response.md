Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `lst` is a list of indices where `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, `zero` is the count of '0' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the count of '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`n - 1`)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 1).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop index `i` has reached the second last index of the string `s`, the list `lst` contains all the indices where the percentage of '0' and '1' in the string `s` up to that index are both greater than or equal to 50. The counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s` up to the second last index are stored in `zero` and `one` respectively. The percentages of '0' and '1' in the string `s` up to the second last index are stored in `zero_perc` and `one_perc` respectively.
