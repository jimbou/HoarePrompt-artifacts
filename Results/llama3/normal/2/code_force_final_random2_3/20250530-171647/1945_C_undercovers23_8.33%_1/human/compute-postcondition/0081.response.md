Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `s` is a string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s` and is increased by 1, `lst` is a list containing the values `i + 1` where `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is 1, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element equals `mini`, `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil((z+1) * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.**

The value of `z` is increased by 1, and the value of `zero_perc` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
