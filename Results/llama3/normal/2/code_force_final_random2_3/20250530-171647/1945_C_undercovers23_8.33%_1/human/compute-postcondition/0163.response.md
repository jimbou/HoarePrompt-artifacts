Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `lst` is an empty list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the count of '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`n - 1`)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 1), `mini` is the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and all elements in `lst`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that `i` remains at `n - 1`, `lst` becomes empty as all its elements have been iterated over, `ele` takes the value of the last element in the original `lst`, `zero` and `one` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` also remain unchanged for the same reason, and `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and all elements in `lst`.
