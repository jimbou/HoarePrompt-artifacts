Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `ele` is not defined, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `final` contains `n`, `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`, `elem` is not defined, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, and `c1` is less than 50**

The code appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is added to the list `final`, which was previously empty. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
