Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is `n` - len(`lst`) - 1, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `final` is a list containing either 0 or `n` or `n` and the second element in `lst`, `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`, `elem` is the second element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then the second element of `lst` is added to `final`.**

In this output state, the value of `final` has been updated to include the second element of `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
