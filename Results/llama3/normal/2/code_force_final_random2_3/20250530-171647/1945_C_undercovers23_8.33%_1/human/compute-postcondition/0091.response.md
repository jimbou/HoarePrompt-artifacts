Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer and must be greater than 2, s is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the count of '1' in s, z is the count of '0' in s, lst is a list containing the values i + 1 where zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50, mini is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between pk and all elements in lst, i is 2, ele is the last element in lst, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst where the absolute difference between pk and the element equals mini, pk is n // 2 if n is even, otherwise pk is n // 2, zero_perc is math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)), and one_perc is math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)).**

The code calculates the percentage of zeros and ones in the string `s` up to the current index `i`. The `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of the product of `zero` and 100 divided by `i + 1`, where `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`. The `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of the product of `o - one` and 100 divided by `n - i - 1`, where `o` is the count of '1' in `s` and `one` is the count of '1' in `s` up to the current index `i`. The values of `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are updated based on the current index `i` and the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
