Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `s` is a string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`, `one` is the count of '1' in `s`, `lst` is a list containing the values `i + 1` where `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` and must have at least 3 elements, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 3`, `ele` is the third element in `lst`.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
