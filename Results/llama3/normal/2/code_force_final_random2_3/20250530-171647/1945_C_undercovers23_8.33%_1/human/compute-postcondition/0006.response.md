Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an odd integer, `s` is a string, `pk` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `pk` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` is an odd integer, `pk` will be the largest integer less than or equal to half of `n`. The values of `t`, `s`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
