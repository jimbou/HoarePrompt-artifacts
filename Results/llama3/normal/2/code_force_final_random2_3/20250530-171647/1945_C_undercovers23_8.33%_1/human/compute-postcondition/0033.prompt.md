Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, n is an integer, s is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the count of '1' in s, z is the count of '0' in s, zero is 0, one is 0, lst is an empty list, mini is 100000000
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0, n is at least 2, s is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the count of '1' in s, z is the count of '0' in s, if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50, then lst is a list containing the value i + 1, otherwise lst is an empty list, mini is 100000000, i is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is greater than 0, n is at least 3, s is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the count of '1' in s plus 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it remains the same, z is the count of '0' in s plus 1 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, zero_perc is the ceiling of (z * 100) / (i + 1), one_perc is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100) / (n - i - 1), lst is a list containing the value i + 1 if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50, otherwise it is an empty list, mini is 100000000, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 0, n is at least 3, s is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the count of '1' in s plus 1 if s[i] is '1', otherwise it remains the same, z is the count of '0' in s plus 2 if s[i] is '0', otherwise it remains the same, zero_perc is the ceiling of (z * 100) / (i + 1), one_perc is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100) / (n - i - 1), if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50, then lst is a list containing the value i + 1, otherwise lst is an empty list, mini is 100000000, i is 2, and one is increased by 1 if s[i] is '1'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
