Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 1)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)), `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `one` is increased by 1. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` has an additional element `i + 1`.***
