The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i + 2`. 
State: **`lst` is a list, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 2)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 2)), `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2`.**
