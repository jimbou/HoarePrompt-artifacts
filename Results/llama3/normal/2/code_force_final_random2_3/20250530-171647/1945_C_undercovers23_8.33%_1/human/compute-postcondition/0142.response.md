To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `zero_perc` is 100
- `one_perc` is 0
- All other variables remain unchanged.

And the condition for `lst` to have an additional element is:
- `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50
- `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50

However, this condition does not directly affect the loop's continuation but rather the modification of `lst`. The loop's continuation depends solely on `i` and `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1 (since it's a `for` loop with a `range`), and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since we don't have the exact value of `n`, we can only say that `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i` plus 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration, considering only the variables in the loop head, is adjusted as follows:

- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (but we don't know the exact value, so we can say `i` is `i + 1`).
- `n` must be greater than the new value of `i` plus 1.

The other variables (`zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and the condition for `lst`) do not affect the loop's continuation directly, so their states are not adjusted in the context of the loop's execution.

State: **`zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
