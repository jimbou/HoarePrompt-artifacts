Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer and must be greater than i, s is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the count of '1' in s, z is the count of '0' in s, zero is 0, one is 0, lst is an empty list, i is n, ele is not defined, mini is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between pk and all elements in lst, pk is n // 2, elem is not defined. If final is empty, c1 is o * 100 // n. If c1 is greater than or equal to 50, final is a list containing 0. If c1 is less than 50, final contains n. The first element of the list final is being printed. The first element of final is either 0 or n. If the percentage of '1' in s is greater than or equal to 50, the first element of final is 0. If the percentage of '1' in s is less than 50, the first element of final is n, _ is t + 1**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of pk has been updated to be n // 2, which is the integer division of n by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
