Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is `n` - len(`lst`), `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst` and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element equals `mini`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing 0. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing the value `n`. The first element of the `final` list is being printed. `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element of `lst`. This means that `mini` now represents the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`, including the first element `ele`.
