Output State: **zero_perc is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 1)), one_perc is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)), i is i + 1, n is greater than i + 1. If s[i] is '0', then zero is increased by 1. Otherwise, one is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `zero_perc` and `one_perc` have been updated based on the calculations performed in the code. The value of `zero_perc` is now the ceiling of the result of multiplying `zero` by 100 and then dividing by `i + 1`. Similarly, the value of `one_perc` is now the ceiling of the result of multiplying `o - one` by 100 and then dividing by `n - i - 1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `n` is still greater than `i + 1`. The values of `zero` and `one` have also been updated based on the value of `s[i]`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` has been increased by 1; otherwise, `one` has been increased by 1.
