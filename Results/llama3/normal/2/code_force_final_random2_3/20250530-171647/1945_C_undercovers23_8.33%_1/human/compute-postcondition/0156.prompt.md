Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The program prints the first element of the list final, which is either 0 or n, based on the percentage of '1' in the string s. The value of n does not affect the outcome. The string s has been converted to a list sl. The count of '1' in sl is stored in o, and the count of '0' in sl is stored in z. The variables zero and one are initialized to 0. An empty list lst has been created. The variable mini has been assigned a large value, specifically 10 to the power of 8.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0, and all other variables remain unchanged. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` has an additional element which is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`lst` is a list, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 1)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)), `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `one` is increased by 1. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` has an additional element `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`lst` is a list, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 1)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)), `zero` and `one` remain unchanged. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` has an additional element `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
