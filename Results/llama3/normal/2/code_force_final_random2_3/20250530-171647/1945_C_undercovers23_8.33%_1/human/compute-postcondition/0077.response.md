Postcondition: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer and must be greater than 1, s is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the count of '1' in s, z is the count of '0' in s. If s[i] is '0', z equals zero + 1 and zero is 1. Otherwise, z equals zero and one is 1. lst is a list containing the values i + 1 where zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50, mini is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between pk and all elements in lst, i is 0, ele is the last element in lst, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst where the absolute difference between pk and the element equals mini. If c1 is greater than or equal to 50, final is a list containing 0. Otherwise, final is a list containing the value n. The first element of the final list is being printed. pk is n // 2 if n is even, otherwise pk is n // 2. zero_perc is math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)), one_perc is math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)). The current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50.**
