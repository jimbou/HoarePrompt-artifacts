Output State: **`lst` is a list with an additional element `i + 1`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 1)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)), `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `zero` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the list `lst` has been updated by appending the value `i + 1`. The values of `zero_perc` and `one_perc` remain the same as they were calculated based on the previous values of `zero`, `i`, `o`, `one`, and `n`. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The value of `n` is still greater than `i + 1`. The values of `zero` and `one` have been updated based on the value of `s[i]`.
