Output State: **`i` is `n`, `lst` is a list that must have at least `n` elements, `elem` is the last element in the list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the count of '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`n - 1`)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 1), `mini` is the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and all elements in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` is a sorted list containing all elements of `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`. Otherwise, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements of `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`, excluding the first element. `final` is an empty list, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, except for `c1`, which is newly assigned the value of `o * 100 // n`. The value of `c1` is calculated by multiplying `o` by 100 and then performing integer division by `n`. The other variables, including `i`, `lst`, `elem`, `ele`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `mini`, and `final`, remain unchanged.
