Output State: **`lst` is a list, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 1)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)), `zero` and `one` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `lst` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The value of `i` is still `i + 2` as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is still greater than `i + 2` as it is not modified by the code. The value of `zero_perc` is updated to the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 1)) and the value of `one_perc` is updated to the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)). The values of `zero` and `one` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
