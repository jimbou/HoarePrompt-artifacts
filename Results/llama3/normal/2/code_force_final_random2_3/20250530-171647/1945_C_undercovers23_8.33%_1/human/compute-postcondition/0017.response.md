Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `lst` is a list containing the value `i + 1`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0, the current value of `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (zero * 100 / (i + 1)) and is greater than or equal to 50, the current value of `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)) and is greater than or equal to 50.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `mini`, `i`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged. The list `lst` now contains the value `i + 1`, which is 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
