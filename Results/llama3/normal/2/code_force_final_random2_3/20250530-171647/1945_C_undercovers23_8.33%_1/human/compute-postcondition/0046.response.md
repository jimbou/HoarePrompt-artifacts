To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for elem in lst:`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If the list has at least one more element, the loop executes again.

At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 1 element, `elem` is the last element in `lst`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must have at least one more element, and `elem` must be the next element in `lst`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `s` is a string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`, `one` is the count of '1' in `s`, `lst` is a list containing the values `i + 1` where `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` and must have at least 2 elements, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is `n - len(lst)`, `ele` is the second last element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing the first element in `lst` if `pk` minus the first element in `lst` equals `mini`, otherwise `final` is an empty list, `elem` is the second element in `lst`.**
