Output State: **`zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `zero` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `zero_perc` and `one_perc` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still `i + 1`, indicating that it has been incremented by 1. The value of `n` is still greater than `i + 1`, maintaining the initial condition. Additionally, the value of `zero` has been incremented by 1, as specified in the code.
