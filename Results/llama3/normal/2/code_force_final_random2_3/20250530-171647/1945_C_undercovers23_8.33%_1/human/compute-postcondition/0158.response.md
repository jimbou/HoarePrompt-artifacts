Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `lst` is a list of indices that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the count of '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`n - 1`)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 1), `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The other variables remain unchanged.
