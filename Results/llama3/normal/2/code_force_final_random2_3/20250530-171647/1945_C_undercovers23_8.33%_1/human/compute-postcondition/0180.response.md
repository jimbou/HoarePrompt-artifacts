Output State: **`i` is `n`, `lst` is a list that must have at least `n` elements, `elem` is the last element in the list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the count of '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`n - 1`)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 1), `mini` is the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and all elements in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` is a sorted list containing all elements of `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`. Otherwise, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements of `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`, excluding the first element. `final` is a list containing 0, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. The current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `final` now contains the element 0, which was appended by the code. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
