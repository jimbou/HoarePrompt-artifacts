Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `s` is a string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`, `one` is the count of '1' in `s`, `lst` is a list containing the values `i + 1` where `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is `n - len(lst)`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `final` is an empty list, and `c1` is the percentage of '1' in `s` with respect to `n`. The current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.***
