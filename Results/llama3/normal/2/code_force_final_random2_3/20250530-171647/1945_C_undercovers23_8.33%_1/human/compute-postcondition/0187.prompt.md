Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        pk = n // 2
    else:
        pk = n // 2
    sl = list(s)
    o = sl.count('1')
    z = sl.count('0')
    zero, one = 0, 0
    lst = []
    mini = pow(10, 8)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            zero += 1
        else:
            one += 1
        zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
        one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
        if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
            lst.append(i + 1)
    for ele in lst:
        mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
    final = []
    for elem in lst:
        if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
            final.append(elem)
    final.sort()
    if len(final) == 0:
        c1 = o * 100 // n
        if c1 >= 50:
            final.append(0)
        else:
            final.append(n)
    print(final[0])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `s` is a string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is the count of '0' in `s`, `one` is the count of '1' in `s`, `lst` is a list containing the values `i + 1` where `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is `n - len(lst)`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element equals `mini`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing 0. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing the value `n`. The first element of the `final` list is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `s` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `ele` is not defined, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `pk` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is `n // 2`, `elem` is not defined. If `final` is empty, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a list containing 0. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` contains `n`. The first element of the list `final` is being printed. The first element of `final` is either 0 or `n`. If the percentage of '1' in `s` is greater than or equal to 50, the first element of `final` is 0. If the percentage of '1' in `s` is less than 50, the first element of `final` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n`, `lst` is a list that must have at least `n` elements, `elem` is the last element in the list, `ele` is the last element in the original `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `one` is the count of '1' in the string `s` up to index `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`n - 1`)), `one_perc` is the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / 1), `mini` is the minimum of its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and all elements in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` is a sorted list containing all elements of `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`. Otherwise, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements of `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini`, excluding the first element. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, then `final` is a list containing 0. If `c1` is less than 50, then `final` is a list containing `n`, and the first element of `final` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
