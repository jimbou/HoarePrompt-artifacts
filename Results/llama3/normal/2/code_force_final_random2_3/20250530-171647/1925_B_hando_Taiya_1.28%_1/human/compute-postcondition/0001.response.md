To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. Since `x` is already between 1 and 10^8, we can conclude that `x` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `i` is initialized to 1.

State: **stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), x is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 0, i is 1**
