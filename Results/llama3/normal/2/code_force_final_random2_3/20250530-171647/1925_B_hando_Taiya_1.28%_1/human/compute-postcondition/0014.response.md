Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), x is an integer greater than 3, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is either 0, i or the maximum of the previous value of ans and x // i, i is 2, if i is a divisor of x, then if n is less than or equal to x // i then ans is either 0 or i. If n is greater than x // i then ans is the maximum of the previous value of ans and x // i***
