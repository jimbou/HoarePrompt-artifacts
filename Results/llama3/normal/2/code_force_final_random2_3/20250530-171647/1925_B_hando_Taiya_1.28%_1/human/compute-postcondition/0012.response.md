Output State: **`ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `i`, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), if `i` is a divisor of `x`, then if `n` is less than or equal to `x` // `i` then `ans` is either 0 or `i`. If `n` is greater than `x` // `i` then `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x` // `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `i`, which is 2. The values of `x`, `n`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The relationship between `i`, `x`, and `n` also remains the same, with `i` being a divisor of `x` and `n` being between 1 and `x`.
