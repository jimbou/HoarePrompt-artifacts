The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`. Since `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`, the print statement will output the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.

Output: **the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to n**
