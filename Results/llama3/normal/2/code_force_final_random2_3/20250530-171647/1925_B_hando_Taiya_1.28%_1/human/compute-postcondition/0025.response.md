The code prints the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`, where `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, and `i` is the integer square root of `x` plus 1.
Output: **`stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is the integer square root of `x` plus 1, and the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` which is `ans` is being printed**
