Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer greater than 9, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is either 0, 3 or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x` // 3, `i` is 3. If `i` is a divisor of `x`, then if `n` is less than or equal to `x` // `i`, `ans` is either 0 or 3. If `n` is greater than `x` // `i`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x` // 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 3. The values of `stdin`, `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans` being 0, 3, or the maximum of its previous value and `x` // 3 still apply, depending on whether `i` is a divisor of `x` and the value of `n`.
