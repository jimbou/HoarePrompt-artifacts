The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `isqrt(x) + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `isqrt(x)` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), x is an integer greater than 3, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is either 0, i or the maximum of the previous value of ans and x // i, i is 2, if i is a divisor of x, then if n is less than or equal to x // i then ans is either 0 or i. If n is greater than x // i then ans is the maximum of the previous value of ans and x // i.**
