Output State: **`ans` is either 0, 2 or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // 2`, `x` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), if `i` is a divisor of `x`, then if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` then `ans` is either 0 or `i`. If `n` is greater than `x // i` then `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `i` being a divisor of `x` and the relationship between `n` and `x // i` still hold.
