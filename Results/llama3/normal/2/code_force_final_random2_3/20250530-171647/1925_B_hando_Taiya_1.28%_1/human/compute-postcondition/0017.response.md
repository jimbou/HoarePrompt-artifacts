The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `isqrt(x) + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 9.
State: **`stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer greater than 9, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is either 0, `i` or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x` // `i`, `i` is 3. If `i` is a divisor of `x`, then if `n` is less than or equal to `x` // `i`, `ans` is either 0 or `i`. If `n` is greater than `x` // `i`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x` // `i`.**
