Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), the current value of `i` is a divisor of `x`, and the current value of `n` is less than or equal to `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1, and `x` and `n` are still integers within their respective ranges. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each with two integers. The relationship between `i`, `x`, and `n` remains the same, with `i` being a divisor of `x` and `n` being less than or equal to `i`.
