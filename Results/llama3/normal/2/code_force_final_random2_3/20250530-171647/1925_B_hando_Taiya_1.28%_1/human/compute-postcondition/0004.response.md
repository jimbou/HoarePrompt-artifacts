Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or `i`, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 1, `i` is a divisor of `x`, `n` is less than or equal to `x` divided by `i`, and stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (0) and the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now either 0 or `i`, depending on whether `i` is greater than 0. The rest of the state remains the same, with `x` being an integer greater than 0, `n` being an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` being 1, `i` being a divisor of `x`, and `n` being less than or equal to `x` divided by `i`. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers.
