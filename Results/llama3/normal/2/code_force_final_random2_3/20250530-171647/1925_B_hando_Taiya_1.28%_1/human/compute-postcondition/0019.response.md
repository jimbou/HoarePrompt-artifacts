Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer greater than 9, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is either 0, `i` or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x` // `i`, `i` is 3. If `i` is a divisor of `x`, then if `n` is less than or equal to `x` // `i`, `ans` is either 0 or `i`. If `n` is greater than `x` // `i`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x` // `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x` divided by `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` and `n`. The value of `x` is still greater than 9, and `n` is still between 1 and `x`. The value of `i` is still 3.
