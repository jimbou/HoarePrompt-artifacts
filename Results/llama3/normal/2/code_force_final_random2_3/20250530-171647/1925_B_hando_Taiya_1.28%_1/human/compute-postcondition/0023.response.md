Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is the integer square root of `x` plus 1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same input format, with `x` and `n` being integers within the given ranges. The value of `ans` will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`, which means it will hold the largest factor of `x` that does not exceed `n`. The loop variable `i` will have a value equal to the integer square root of `x` plus 1, indicating that the loop has iterated up to the square root of `x`.
