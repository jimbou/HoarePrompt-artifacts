Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list containing a tuple (n, s) where n is an integer and s is a string, stdin is empty, _ is 1, n is an integer, s is a string**

The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since stdin is empty, this operation does not affect the state of stdin. The second line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `s`. Again, since stdin is empty, this operation does not affect the state of stdin. The third line appends a tuple containing the values of `n` and `s` to the `cases` list. The value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged.
