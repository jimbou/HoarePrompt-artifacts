Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list containing t tuples (n, s) where n is an integer and s is a string, stdin is empty, _ is t-1, n is an integer, s is a string**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t remains a positive integer, the list cases contains t tuples, each containing an integer n and a string s. The stdin is empty, indicating that all input lines have been read. The variable _ has reached the value t-1, indicating that the loop has executed t times. The variables n and s retain their last values from the input.
