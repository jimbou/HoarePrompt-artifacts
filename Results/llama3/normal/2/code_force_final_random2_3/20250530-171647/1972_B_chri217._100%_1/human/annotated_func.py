#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input: the first line contains a positive integer t, and for each of the t test cases, the first line contains a positive integer n and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of "U" and "D".
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        
        cases.append((n, s))
        
    #State: t is a positive integer, cases is a list containing t tuples (n, s) where n is an integer and s is a string, stdin is empty, _ is t-1, n is an integer, s is a string
    return cases
    #The program returns a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains an integer 'n' and a string 's'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads input from standard input, expecting a specific format: a positive integer t, followed by t test cases, each consisting of a positive integer n and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" characters. The function processes this input and returns a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains the integer n and the string s from each test case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a list of two elements, the first element is an integer and the second element is a string consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters.
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #The program returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the second element of the case list is odd, otherwise it returns 'NO'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether the number of 'U' characters in a given string is odd or even, returning 'YES' for odd counts and 'NO' for even counts.
