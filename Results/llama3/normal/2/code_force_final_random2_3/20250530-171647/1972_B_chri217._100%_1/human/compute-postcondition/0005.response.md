The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cases` is a list containing a tuple (n, s) where n is an integer and s is a string, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string**
