Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The problem asks to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` reads the input from stdin and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of coins and the string representing the coins. `func_2` takes a tuple as input and returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the string is odd, and 'NO' otherwise.

The key insight to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is essentially a parity game. The number of 'U' characters in the string represents the parity of the game state. If the number of 'U' characters is odd, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of 'U' characters, forcing him to lose. Conversely, if the number of 'U' characters is even, Bob can always make a move that will leave Alice with an odd number of 'U' characters, forcing her to lose.

The program correctly implements this insight by counting the number of 'U' characters in the string and returning 'YES' if the count is odd, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
