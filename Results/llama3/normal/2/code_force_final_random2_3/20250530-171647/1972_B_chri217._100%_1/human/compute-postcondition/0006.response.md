Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, cases is a list containing a tuple (n, s) where n is an integer and s is a string, stdin is empty, _ is 2, n is an integer, s is a string**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable n. Since stdin is empty, this line does not affect the state of the program. The second line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to the variable s. Again, since stdin is empty, this line does not affect the state of the program. The third line appends a tuple containing the values of n and s to the list cases. Since n and s are not modified by the code, their values remain the same. The list cases is updated to include the new tuple.

In summary, the code snippet does not modify the values of t, _, or the original values of n and s. The list cases is updated to include a new tuple containing the values of n and s. The final state of the program is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the new tuple in the list cases.
