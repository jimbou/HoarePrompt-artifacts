Postcondition: ***_t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer equal to the value of the input, s is a binary string of the same length as t, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is being printed. If cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 is odd or cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is being printed. If cnt1 is less than or equal to 2 and '11' is in s, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed.***
