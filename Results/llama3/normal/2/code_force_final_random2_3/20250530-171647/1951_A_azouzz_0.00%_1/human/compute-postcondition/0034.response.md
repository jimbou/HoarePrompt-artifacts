Output State: **_t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer equal to the value of the input, s is a binary string of the same length as t, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code snippet reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, and reads a binary string from stdin and assigns it to `s`. It then counts the number of '1's in `s` and assigns the result to `cnt1`. The values of `_t` and `_` remain unchanged. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that one test case has been processed.
