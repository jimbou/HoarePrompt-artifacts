Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string of the same length. It counts the number of '1's in the binary string and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the count and the presence of consecutive '1's in the string. The function iterates through all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
