The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`**
