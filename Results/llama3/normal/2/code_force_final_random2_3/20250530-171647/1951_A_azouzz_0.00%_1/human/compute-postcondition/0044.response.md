Postcondition: ***_t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer equal to the value of the input, s is a binary string of the same length as t, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1), 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, if '11' is in s, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed.***
