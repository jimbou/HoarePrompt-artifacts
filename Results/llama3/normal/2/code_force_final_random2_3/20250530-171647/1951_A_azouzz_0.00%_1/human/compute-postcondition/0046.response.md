Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and equal to 0, _ is equal to the initial value of t, n is an integer equal to the value of the input, s is a binary string of the same length as t, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s, stdin contains no test cases. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and cnt1 is odd or cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t will be equal to 0, the variable _ will be equal to the initial value of t, the variable n will be equal to the value of the input, the variable s will be a binary string of the same length as t, the variable cnt1 will be equal to the number of '1's in s, and there will be no more test cases in stdin. The loop will print 'YES' if cnt1 is greater than 2 and even, 'NO' if cnt1 is greater than 2 and odd or equal to 1, 'NO' if '11' is in s, and 'YES' otherwise.
