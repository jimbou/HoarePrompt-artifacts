Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a binary string of the same length as t, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0 as it is not used or modified in the code. The value of `n` is assigned the integer value of the input from stdin, which is a binary string of the same length as `t`. The value of `s` is assigned the binary string input from stdin. The value of `cnt1` is assigned the count of '1's in the binary string `s`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one as one test case is consumed by the code.
