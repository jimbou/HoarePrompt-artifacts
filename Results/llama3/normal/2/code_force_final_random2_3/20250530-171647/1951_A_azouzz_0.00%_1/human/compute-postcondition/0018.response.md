Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, s is a binary string of the same length as t, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and either cnt1 is an odd number or cnt1 is equal to 1, then 'NO' is printed. If cnt1 is less than or equal to 2 or cnt1 is an even number, then if the binary string s contains the substring '11', 'NO' is printed, otherwise 'YES' is printed.***
