The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two inputs: an integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer. Since `t` accepts the first input, which is an integer, the stdin now contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was just inputted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`.**
