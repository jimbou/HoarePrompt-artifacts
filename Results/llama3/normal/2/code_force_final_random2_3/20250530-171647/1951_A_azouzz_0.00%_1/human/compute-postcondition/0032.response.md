Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, s is a binary string of the same length as t, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and cnt1 is odd or cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
