The only variable in the loop head is variable _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ is 2 and t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2.
State: **_t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, s is a binary string of the same length as t, cnt1 is an integer equal to the number of '1's in s, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and cnt1 is even, 'YES' is printed. If cnt1 is greater than 2 and cnt1 is odd or cnt1 is 1, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if '11' is in s, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
