Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the number of lamps is 2 and the desired configuration is "11". In this case, the program should print "NO" because it is not possible to turn on both lamps by choosing two non-adjacent lamps that are currently turned off. However, the program prints "YES" in this case.

Here is the incorrect output:

```
1
2
11
YES
```

The correct output should be:

```
1
2
11
NO
```

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
