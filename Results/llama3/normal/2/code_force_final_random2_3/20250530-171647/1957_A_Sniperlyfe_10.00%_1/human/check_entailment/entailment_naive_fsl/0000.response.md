Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], the program will output 2, but the correct output should be 2 (two squares of side length 2 and one square of side length 3). The program is not considering the case where the frequency of a number is not a multiple of 4, but it can still be used to form a polygon.

The program is only considering the case where the frequency of a number is a multiple of 4, and it is not considering the case where the frequency of a number is not a multiple of 4, but it can still be used to form a polygon. For example, if the input is [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], the program will output 2, but the correct output should be 2 (two squares of side length 2 and one square of side length 3).

The program should be modified to consider all possible cases, not just the case where the frequency of a number is a multiple of 4.
