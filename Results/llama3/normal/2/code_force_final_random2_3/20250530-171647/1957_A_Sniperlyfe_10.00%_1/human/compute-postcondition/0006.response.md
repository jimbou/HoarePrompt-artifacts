Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that has at least 3 integers, each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in `arr` and the value is 1, and the key is the second integer in `arr` and the value is at least 1, and the key is the third integer in `arr` and the value is at least 2, `n` is the third integer in the list `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `freq[n]` has been incremented by 1, since `n` is the third integer in the list `arr` and its frequency was at least 1 before the code was executed. The other variables remain unchanged.
