Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where each key is an integer from `arr` and the value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, `n` is the last integer in the list `arr`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same list `arr` as the initial state, but the dictionary `freq` will now contain key-value pairs for each unique integer in `arr`, where the key is the integer and the value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`. The variable `n` will be the last integer in the list `arr`.
