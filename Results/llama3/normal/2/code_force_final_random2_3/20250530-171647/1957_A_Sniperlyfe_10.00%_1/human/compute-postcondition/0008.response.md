Output State: **The program returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the list `arr` by 4.**

In this output state, the frequency of each integer in the list `arr` is obtained from the dictionary `freq`, where each key is an integer from `arr` and the value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`. The integer division of each frequency by 4 is calculated, and the results are summed up to produce the final output.
