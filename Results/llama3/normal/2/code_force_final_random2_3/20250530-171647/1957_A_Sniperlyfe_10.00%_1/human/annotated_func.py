#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where each key is an integer from `arr` and the value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, `n` is the last integer in the list `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the list `arr` by 4.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each integer in the input list by 4. It accepts a list of integers as input, where each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and returns an integer value representing the sum of the frequency divisions. The function does not modify the input list.
