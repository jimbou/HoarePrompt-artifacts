Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is an empty dictionary**.

In this output state, the value of `arr` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `freq` and assigned it an empty dictionary.
