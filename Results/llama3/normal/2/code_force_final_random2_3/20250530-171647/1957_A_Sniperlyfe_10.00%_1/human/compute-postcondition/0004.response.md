Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that has at least 2 integers, each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in `arr` and the value is 1, and the key is the second integer in `arr` and the value is at least 1, `n` is the second integer in the list `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `freq[n]` has been updated to be at least 1, which means the frequency of the second integer in the list `arr` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
