The only variables in the loop head are variables  n and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `arr`. If arr is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, arr is a list of integers, each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `arr` is not empty and n is now the first integer in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is an empty dictionary, n is the first integer in the list**
