The only variable in the loop head is variable `n` and list `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in `arr` and the value is 1, `n` is the first integer in the list `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `n` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that has at least 2 integers, each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in `arr` and the value is 1, `n` is the second integer in the list `arr`.**
