The code `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1` updates the frequency dictionary `freq` by incrementing the count of the integer `n` (which is the first integer in the list `arr`) by 1. If `n` is not already a key in `freq`, it is added with a count of 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that is not empty, each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in `arr` and the value is 1, `n` is the first integer in the list `arr`.**

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged, but the dictionary `freq` now contains at least one key-value pair, where the key is the first integer in `arr` (i.e., `n`) and the value is 1, indicating that this integer has been seen once. The value of `n` remains the same, which is the first integer in the list `arr`.
