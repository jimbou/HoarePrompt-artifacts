The code prints the difference between the element at index `(d - 1) * 2` and the element at index `(c - 1) * 2` in the list `b`. 

Since `b` is a list containing two zeros, the last two elements of `b` are updated, and `b[-2]` is updated to `b[-2] + v`, the list `b` has the form `[0, b[-2], 0, b[-1]]`. 

Given that `c` is less than `d`, `(c - 1) * 2` is less than `(d - 1) * 2`. 

Since `b` has only four elements, `(c - 1) * 2` and `(d - 1) * 2` can only be 0 or 2. 

If `(c - 1) * 2` is 0, then `(d - 1) * 2` is 2. 

In this case, `b[(d - 1) * 2]` is `b[2]` which is 0 and `b[(c - 1) * 2]` is `b[0]` which is 0. 

So `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` is 0 - 0 which is 0.

If `(c - 1) * 2` is 2, then `(d - 1) * 2` is not a valid index for `b`. 

However, since `c` is less than `d`, `(c - 1) * 2` can only be 0 or 2. 

Therefore, `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` is 0.

Output: **0**
