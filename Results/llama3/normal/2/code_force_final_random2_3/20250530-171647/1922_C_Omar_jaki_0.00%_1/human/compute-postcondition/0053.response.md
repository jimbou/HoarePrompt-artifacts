Output: **t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 * number of iterations elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2 * number of iterations additional elements calculated based on the values of v, x, y, z, and w, u is not zero and is one less than its original value, c and d are the new values returned by the function r(), w, x, y, z are the last four values from the zipped list, v is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, and stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations less input. The current value of c is less than the current value of d, and the difference between the (d-1)th and (c-1)th elements of list b is being printed, where the (d-1)th element is b[(d - 1) * 2] and the (c-1)th element is b[(c - 1) * 2]**
