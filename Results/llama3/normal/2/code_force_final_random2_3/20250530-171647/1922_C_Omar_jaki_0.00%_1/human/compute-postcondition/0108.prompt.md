Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, `a` is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function `r()`, and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 * number of iterations + 1 elements, `b` is a list containing two zeros, the last two elements of `b` are updated, `c` and `d` are the new values returned by the function `r()`, `u` is the new value returned by the function `r()`, `w` is the (number of iterations - 1)th value returned by the function `r()`, `x` is the (number of iterations)th value returned by the function `r()`, `y` is the (number of iterations + 1)th value returned by the function `r()`, `z` is the (number of iterations + 2)th value returned by the function `r()`, `v` is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations + 1 less input, `b[-2]` is updated to `b[-2]` + `v`, and this is printed: the list `b` containing two zeros with the last two elements updated, and the string 'B'.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 * number of iterations + 1 elements, b is a list containing two zeros, the last two elements of b are updated, c and d are the new values returned by the function r(), u is falsy, w is the (number of iterations - 1)th value returned by the function r(), x is the (number of iterations)th value returned by the function r(), y is the (number of iterations + 1)th value returned by the function r(), z is the (number of iterations + 2)th value returned by the function r(), v is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations + 1 less input, b[-2] is updated to b[-2] + v, and this is printed: the list b containing two zeros with the last two elements updated, and the string 'B'. If the current value of c is less than the current value of d, the difference between the (d - 1) * 2th element of the list b and the (c - 1) * 2th element of the list b is printed. If c is greater than or equal to d, the difference between the (2 * c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2 * d - 1)th element of the list b is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *t is greater than the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 * number of iterations + 1 elements, b is a list containing two zeros, the last two elements of b are updated, c and d are the new values returned by the function r(), w is the (number of iterations - 1)th value returned by the function r(), x is the (number of iterations)th value returned by the function r(), y is the (number of iterations + 1)th value returned by the function r(), z is the (number of iterations + 2)th value returned by the function r(), v is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations + 1 less input, b[-2] is updated to b[-2] + v, and this is printed: the list b containing two zeros with the last two elements updated, and the string 'B'. If the current value of c is less than the current value of d, the difference between the (d - 1) * 2th element of the list b and the (c - 1) * 2th element of the list b is printed. If c is greater than or equal to d, the difference between the (2 * c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2 * d - 1)th element of the list b is printed, and u is truthy.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 * number of iterations + 1 elements, b is a list containing two zeros, the last two elements of b are updated, c and d are the new values returned by the function r(), w is the (number of iterations - 1)th value returned by the function r(), x is the (number of iterations)th value returned by the function r(), y is the (number of iterations + 1)th value returned by the function r(), z is the (number of iterations + 2)th value returned by the function r(), v is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations + 1 less input, b[-2] is updated to b[-2] + v, and this is printed: the list b containing two zeros with the last two elements updated, and the string 'B'. If the current value of c is less than the current value of d, the difference between the (d - 1) * 2th element of the list b and the (c - 1) * 2th element of the list b is printed. If c is greater than or equal to d, the difference between the (2 * c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2 * d - 1)th element of the list b is printed, and u is 0 and must be truthy.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
