Output: **t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 * number of iterations elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2 * number of iterations additional elements calculated based on the values of v, x, y, z, and w, u is zero, stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations less input, c and d are the values returned by the function r(), w, x, y, z are the last four values from the zipped list, v is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, and this is printed: the list b and the string 'B'**
