Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus one, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros, u is zero, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input, c and d are the values returned by the function r().
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus one, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and two additional elements calculated based on the values of v, x, y, z, and w, u is zero, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input, c and d are the values returned by the function r(), w is -1000000000.0, x is the first value returned by the function r(), y is the second value returned by the function r(), z is the third value returned by the function r(), v is the difference between y and x

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus one, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 8 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and four additional elements calculated based on the values of v, x, y, z, and w, u is zero, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input, c and d are the values returned by the function r(), w is the fourth value returned by the function r(), x is the fifth value returned by the function r(), y is the sixth value returned by the function r(), z is the seventh value returned by the function r(), v is the difference between y and x and is used to calculate the last two elements of list b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus one, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 12 elements, b is a list containing two zeros and six additional elements calculated based on the values of v, x, y, z, and w, u is zero, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input, c and d are the values returned by the function r(), w is the next value from the zipped list, x is the next value from the zipped list, y is the next value from the zipped list, z is the next value from the zipped list, v is the difference between the new y and x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
