Output: **t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from v, where v is the difference between consecutive elements in list a, u is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input, c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c < d, the difference between the 2*(d-1)th element of list b and the 2*(c-1)th element of list b is being printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th and (2*d - 1)th elements of list b is being printed.**
