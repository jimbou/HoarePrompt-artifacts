Output State: **t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus one, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros, u is zero, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input, c and d are the values returned by the function r().**

The first line decrements the value of t by 1. The second line calls the function r(), but its return values are not assigned to any variables, so they are discarded. The third line reassigns the list a to contain -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0. The fourth line initializes the list b with two zeros. The values of u, stdin, c, and d remain unchanged.
