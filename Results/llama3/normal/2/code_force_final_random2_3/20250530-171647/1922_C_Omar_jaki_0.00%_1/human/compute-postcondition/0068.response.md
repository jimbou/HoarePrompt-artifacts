Output: **t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 * number of iterations elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2 * number of iterations additional elements calculated based on the values of v, x, y, z, and w, u is greater than 0 and is at least 1, c and d are the new values returned by the function r(), w, x, y, z are the last four values from the zipped list, v is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, and stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations less input, and the difference between the (d-1)th and (c-1)th elements of the list b is being printed**
