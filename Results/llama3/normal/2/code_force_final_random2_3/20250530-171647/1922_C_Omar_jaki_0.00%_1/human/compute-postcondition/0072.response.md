Output State: **t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 * number of iterations elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2 * number of iterations additional elements calculated based on the values of v, x, y, z, and w, u is zero, c and d are the new values returned by the function r(), w, x, y, z are the last four values from the zipped list, v is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, and stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations less input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `t` is reduced by the number of iterations of the loop.
- The list `a` contains the initial value -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function `r()` during each iteration, and the final value 2000000000.0. The list must have at least 4 times the number of iterations elements.
- The list `b` contains two zeros and additional elements calculated based on the values of `v`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`. The number of additional elements is twice the number of iterations.
- The value of `u` is zero, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
- The values of `c` and `d` are the new values returned by the function `r()` during the last iteration.
- The values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are the last four values from the zipped list.
- The value of `v` is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list.
- The stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations less input.
