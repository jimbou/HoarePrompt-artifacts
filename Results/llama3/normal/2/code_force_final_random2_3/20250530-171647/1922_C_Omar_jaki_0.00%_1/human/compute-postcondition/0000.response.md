Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input, t is an integer.**

The first line defines a lambda function `r` that takes no arguments and returns a map object that converts the input into integers and splits it into a sequence of values. The second line uses this function to read the first input, an integer `t`, from stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. As a result, stdin now contains one less input. The value of `t` is an integer, but its specific value is not determined by this code snippet alone.
