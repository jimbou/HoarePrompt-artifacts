Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, `a` is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function `r()`, and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 * number of iterations elements, `b` is a list containing two zeros and 2 * number of iterations additional elements calculated based on the values of `v`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`, `u` is the value returned by the function `r()`, `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`, `w`, `x`, `y`, `z` are the last four values from the zipped list, `v` is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, and this is printed: the list `b` and the string 'B', stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations less input.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 * number of iterations elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2 * number of iterations additional elements calculated based on the values of v, x, y, z, and w, u is not zero and is one less than its original value, c and d are the new values returned by the function r(), w, x, y, z are the last four values from the zipped list, v is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, and stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations less input. If c is less than d, the difference between the (d-1)th and (c-1)th elements of list b is printed, where the (d-1)th element is b[(d - 1) * 2] and the (c-1)th element is b[(c - 1) * 2]. Otherwise, the difference between the (2 * c - 1)th and (2 * d - 1)th elements of list b is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 * number of iterations elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2 * number of iterations additional elements calculated based on the values of v, x, y, z, and w, u is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, c and d are the new values returned by the function r(), w, x, y, z are the last four values from the zipped list, v is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, and stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations less input. If c is less than d, the difference between the (d - 1) * 2th element and the (c - 1) * 2th element of list b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the element at index (c * 2 - 1) and the element at index (d * 2 - 1) of list b is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 * number of iterations elements, b is a list containing two zeros and 2 * number of iterations additional elements calculated based on the values of v, x, y, z, and w, u is greater than 0 and is at least 1, c and d are the new values returned by the function r(), w, x, y, z are the last four values from the zipped list, v is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, and stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations less input. If c is less than d, the difference between the (d-1)th and (c-1)th elements of the list b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2*d - 1)th element of the list b is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
