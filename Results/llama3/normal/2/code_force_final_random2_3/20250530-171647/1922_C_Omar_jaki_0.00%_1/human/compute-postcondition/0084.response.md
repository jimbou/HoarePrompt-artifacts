Output State: **`t` is greater than the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, `a` is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function `r()`, and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 * number of iterations + 1 elements, `b` is a list containing two zeros, the last two elements of `b` are updated, `c` and `d` are the new values returned by the function `r()`, `u` is the new value returned by the function `r()`, `w` is the (number of iterations - 1)th value returned by the function `r()`, `x` is the (number of iterations)th value returned by the function `r()`, `y` is the (number of iterations + 1)th value returned by the function `r()`, `z` is the (number of iterations + 2)th value returned by the function `r()`, `v` is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations + 1 less input, `b[-2]` is updated to `b[-2]` + `v`, and this is printed: the list `b` containing two zeros with the last two elements updated, and the string 'B'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `u` is updated to the new value returned by the function `r()`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains the same elements, including the values returned by the function `r()` and the two extreme values. The list `b` still contains two zeros, but its last two elements are updated. The values of `c`, `d`, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are still the same. The value of `v` is still the difference between the last two values from the zipped list. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with number of iterations + 1 less input. The list `b` with the last two elements updated and the string 'B' are still printed.
