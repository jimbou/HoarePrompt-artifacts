Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, `a` is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function `r()`, and 2000000000.0, `b` is a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from `v`, where `v` is the difference between consecutive elements in list `a`, `u` is the value returned by the function `r()`, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input, and this is printed: a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from `v`, where `v` is the difference between consecutive elements in list `a`, and the string 'B'
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from v, where v is the difference between consecutive elements in list a, u is not zero and is one less than its original value, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input, and this is printed: a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from v, where v is the difference between consecutive elements in list a, and the string 'B', c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the value at index (d - 1) * 2 and the value at index (c - 1) * 2 in list b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the value at index (2*c - 1) in list b and the value at index (2*d - 1) in list b is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from v, where v is the difference between consecutive elements in list a, u is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input, c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c < d, the difference between the 2*(d-1)th element of list b and the 2*(c-1)th element of list b is being printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th and (2*d - 1)th elements of list b is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from v, where v is the difference between consecutive elements in list a, u is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input, c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c < d, the difference between the 2*(d-1)th element of list b and the 2*(c-1)th element of list b is being printed. Otherwise, the difference between the (2*c - 1)th and (2*d - 1)th elements of list b is being printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
