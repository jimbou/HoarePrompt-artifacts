Output State: **t is greater than the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 6 elements, b is a list containing two zeros, the last two elements of b are updated, c and d are the new values returned by the function r(), u is zero, w is the second value returned by the function r(), x is the third value returned by the function r(), y is the fourth value returned by the function r(), z is the fifth value returned by the function r(), v is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations + 1 less input, b[-2] is updated to b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] is updated to b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)**
