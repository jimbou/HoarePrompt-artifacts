Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros, two zeros, and two values calculated from v, v is the difference between the third and second elements in list a, w is the first element in the list, x is the second element in the list, y is the third element in the list, and z is the fourth element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, with at least 4 more elements, b is a list containing two zeros, two zeros, and two values calculated from v, v is the difference between the third and second elements in list a, w is the fifth element in the list, x is the sixth element in the list, y is the seventh element in the list, z is the eighth element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input, b has two additional elements calculated from v and the last two elements of b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus 1, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, with at least 4 more elements, v is the difference between the eighth and seventh elements in list a, w is the sixth element in the list, x is the seventh element in the list, y is the eighth element in the list, z is the ninth element in the list, b is a list containing two zeros, two zeros, two values calculated from v, and two additional elements calculated from v and the last two elements of b, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
