#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer t, then an integer n, then a list of n unique integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in ascending order, then an integer m, and finally m pairs of integers x_i and y_i (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n, x_i != y_i).
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        r()
        
        a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
        
        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        print(b, 'B')
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: t is zero, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from v, where v is the difference between consecutive elements in list a, u is zero, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations less input, and this is printed: a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from v, where v is the difference between consecutive elements in list a, and the string 'B', c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the value at index (d - 1) * 2 and the value at index (c - 1) * 2 in list b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the value at index (2*c - 1) in list b and the value at index (2*d - 1) in list b is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of four inputs: an integer t, an integer n, a list of n unique integers in ascending order, and an integer m, followed by m pairs of integers. The function calculates a list of values based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list of integers and prints this list along with the string 'B'. Then, for each pair of integers, it prints the difference between specific values in the calculated list, depending on whether the first integer is less than the second. The function continues processing test cases until the input is exhausted.
