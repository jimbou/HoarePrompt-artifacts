You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer t, then an integer n, then a list of n unique integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in ascending order, then an integer m, and finally m pairs of integers x_i and y_i (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n, x_i != y_i).
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        r()
        
        a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
        
        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        print(b, 'B')
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: t is zero, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from v, where v is the difference between consecutive elements in list a, u is zero, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations less input, and this is printed: a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from v, where v is the difference between consecutive elements in list a, and the string 'B', c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the value at index (d - 1) * 2 and the value at index (c - 1) * 2 in list b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the value at index (2*c - 1) in list b and the value at index (2*d - 1) in list b is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: t is zero, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from v, where v is the difference between consecutive elements in list a, u is zero, stdin contains multiple test cases with the number of iterations less input, and this is printed: a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from v, where v is the difference between consecutive elements in list a, and the string 'B', c and d are the values returned by the function r(). If c is less than d, the difference between the value at index (d - 1) * 2 and the value at index (c - 1) * 2 in list b is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the value at index (2*c - 1) in list b and the value at index (2*d - 1) in list b is printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
