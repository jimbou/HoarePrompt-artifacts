This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of four inputs: an integer t, an integer n, a list of n unique integers in ascending order, and an integer m, followed by m pairs of integers. The function calculates a list of values based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list of integers and prints this list along with the string 'B'. Then, for each pair of integers, it prints the difference between specific values in the calculated list, depending on whether the first integer is less than the second. The function continues processing test cases until the input is exhausted.
