Postcondition: **t is greater than the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, and must have at least 4 * number of iterations + 1 elements, b is a list containing two zeros, the last two elements of b are updated, c and d are the new values returned by the function r(), w is the (number of iterations - 1)th value returned by the function r(), x is the (number of iterations)th value returned by the function r(), y is the (number of iterations + 1)th value returned by the function r(), z is the (number of iterations + 2)th value returned by the function r(), v is the difference between the last two values from the zipped list, stdin contains multiple test cases with number of iterations + 1 less input, b[-2] is updated to b[-2] + v, and this is printed: the list b containing two zeros with the last two elements updated, and the string 'B'. If the current value of c is less than the current value of d, the difference between the (d - 1) * 2th element of the list b and the (c - 1) * 2th element of the list b is printed. If c is greater than or equal to d, the difference between the (2 * c - 1)th element of the list b and the (2 * d - 1)th element of the list b is printed, and u is 0 and must be truthy.**
