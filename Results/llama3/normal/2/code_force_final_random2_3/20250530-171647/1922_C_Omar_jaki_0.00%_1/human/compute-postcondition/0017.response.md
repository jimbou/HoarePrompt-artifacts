Output: **t is a non-zero integer equal to its original value minus the number of iterations of the loop, a is a list containing -1000000000.0, the values returned by the function r(), and 2000000000.0, b is a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from v, where v is the difference between consecutive elements in list a, u is not zero and is one less than its original value, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less input, and this is printed: a list containing two zeros, followed by pairs of values calculated from v, where v is the difference between consecutive elements in list a, and the string 'B', c and d are the values returned by the function r(). The current value of c is lower than the current value of d. The difference between the value at index (d - 1) * 2 and the value at index (c - 1) * 2 in list b is being printed**
