Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities. It first calculates the cumulative sum of distances between cities in both forward and backward directions, taking into account the special case where the closest city is chosen with a cost of 1 coin. Then, for each query, it simply subtracts the cumulative sum at the starting city from the cumulative sum at the destination city to get the minimum cost.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including the case where the starting city is the first city, the destination city is the last city, and the case where the starting city is the same as the destination city (although this case is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, the program handles it correctly by returning 0).

The use of bitwise operations to calculate the cumulative sum is a clever optimization, and the program correctly handles the case where the distance between two cities is greater than the distance between the current city and its closest city.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
