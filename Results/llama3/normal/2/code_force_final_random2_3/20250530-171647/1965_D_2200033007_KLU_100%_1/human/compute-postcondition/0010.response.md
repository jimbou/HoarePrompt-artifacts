Output State: **odds is a list of integers that must have at least 2 odd integers, n is an odd positive integer, a is a list of n integers where a[idx] and a[n - 1 - idx] are both equal to (x - prev) // 2, prev is the first odd integer in the list, idx is the integer part of (n-1)/2 - 1, x is the second odd integer in the list**

In this output state, the values of `odds`, `n`, `prev`, `idx`, and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only modifications are to the list `a`, where the elements at indices `idx` and `n - 1 - idx` are both assigned the value of `(x - prev) // 2`. This means that these two elements in the list `a` are now equal to half the difference between the second odd integer `x` and the first odd integer `prev`.
