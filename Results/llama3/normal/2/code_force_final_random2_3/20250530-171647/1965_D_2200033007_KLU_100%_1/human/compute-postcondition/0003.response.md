Output State: **bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, the length of smallList is greater than 0, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal if the original lists had more than two elements. If the original lists had only two elements, bigList and smallList are empty lists.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each removing the last element from bigList and smallList, respectively. Since the last elements of both lists were equal, removing them will either leave the lists with equal last elements (if they had more than two elements) or empty lists (if they had only two elements). The length of smallList is now greater than 0 only if it originally had more than two elements. The relative lengths of bigList and smallList remain the same, with bigList being longer than smallList.
