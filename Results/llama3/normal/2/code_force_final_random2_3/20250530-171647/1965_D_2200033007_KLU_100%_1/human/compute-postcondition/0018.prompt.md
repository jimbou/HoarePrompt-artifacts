Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: odds is a list of integers, n is an odd positive integer, a is a list of n zeros, prev is 0, and idx is the integer part of (n-1)/2.
Code of the loop:
for x in odds:
    if idx == n - 1 - idx:
        a[idx] = x
    else:
        a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
    prev = x
    idx = idx - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `odds` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 odd integer, `n` is an odd positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `prev` is the first odd integer in the list, `idx` is the integer part of (n-1)/2 - 1, `x` is the first odd integer in the list. If `idx` is equal to n - 1 - idx, then the integer at index `idx` in `a` is `x` and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, the integers at index `idx` and n - 1 - idx in `a` are both equal to (x - prev) // 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `odds` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 odd integers, `n` is an odd positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `prev` is the second odd integer in the list, `idx` is the integer part of (n-1)/2 - 2, `x` is the second odd integer in the list. If `idx` is equal to `n - 1 - idx`, then the integer part of (n-1)/2 - 2 index in list `a` is the second odd integer in the list. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both equal to `(x - prev) // 2`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: prev is the third odd integer in the list, idx is the integer part of (n-1)/2 - 3, n is an odd positive integer, a is a list of n integers, odds is a list of integers that must have at least 3 odd integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
