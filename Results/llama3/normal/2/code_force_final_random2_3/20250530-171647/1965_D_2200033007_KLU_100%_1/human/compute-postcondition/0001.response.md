Output State: **bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each removing the last element from `bigList` and `smallList`, respectively. Since the last elements of both lists were equal before the code execution, removing them does not change the fact that the remaining last elements are equal. The relative lengths of the lists also remain unchanged, as both lists have one element removed. Therefore, the output state maintains the same properties as the initial state, with the only difference being that both lists are now one element shorter.
