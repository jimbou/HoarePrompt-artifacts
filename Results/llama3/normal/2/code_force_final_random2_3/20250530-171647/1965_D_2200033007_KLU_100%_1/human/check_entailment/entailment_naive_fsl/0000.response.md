Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly recovers a possible palindrome array `a` from the given sums of its distinct subarrays.

Here's a brief explanation of how the program works:

1. Function `func_1` generates all possible subarray sums of the input array `a` and sorts them.
2. Function `func_2` removes duplicates from the sorted list of subarray sums, leaving only the odd counts.
3. Function `func_3` constructs the palindrome array `a` from the odd counts. It starts from the middle of the array and works its way outwards, assigning values to the array elements based on the differences between consecutive odd counts.
4. Function `func_4` is not actually used in the program, but it appears to be a helper function to remove common elements from the end of two lists.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the fact that the input array `a` is a palindrome and that there is always at least one valid solution.

I couldn't find any potential cases where the program would not work as expected, and the examples provided in the problem description are correctly solved by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
