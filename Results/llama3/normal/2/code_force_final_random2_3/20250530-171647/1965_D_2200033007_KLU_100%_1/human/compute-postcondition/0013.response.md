The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list odds, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the odds.  If the list has at least 3 odd integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, odds has at least 2 odd integers, x is the second odd integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 odd integers and the x is the third odd integer in the list.
State: **`odds` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 odd integers, `n` is an odd positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `prev` is the second odd integer in the list, `idx` is the integer part of (n-1)/2 - 2, `x` is the third odd integer in the list**
