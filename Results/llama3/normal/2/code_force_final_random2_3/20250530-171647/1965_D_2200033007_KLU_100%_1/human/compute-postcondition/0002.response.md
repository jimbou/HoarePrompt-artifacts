The variables in the loop head are smallList and bigList, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables smallList and bigList. If the length of smallList is greater than 0 and the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the length of smallList is greater than 0 and the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the length of smallList must be greater than 1 and the last elements of bigList and smallList must be equal.
State: **bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, the length of smallList is greater than 1, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal**
