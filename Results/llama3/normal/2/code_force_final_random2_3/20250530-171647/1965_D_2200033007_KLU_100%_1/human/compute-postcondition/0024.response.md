Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers with length at least 4, cts is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of a plus the sum of the first 4 elements of a, i is 2, sm is equal to the sum of the first 4 elements of a, j is 3**

The code block modifies the `sm` variable by adding the value of the element at index `j` in list `a` to it. Since `j` is 3, this means the fourth element of `a` is added to `sm`. As a result, `sm` now equals the sum of the first 4 elements of `a`.

The code also appends the new value of `sm` to the `cts` list. Since `sm` now represents the sum of the first 4 elements of `a`, this means `cts` now contains the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` plus the sum of the first 4 elements of `a`.

The variables `a`, `i`, and `j` are not modified by the code block, so they retain their initial values.
