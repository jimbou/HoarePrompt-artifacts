Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 odd integers, `n` is an odd positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers where the integer part of (n-1)/2 - 1 index is the second odd integer in the list, `prev` is the first odd integer in the list, `idx` is the integer part of (n-1)/2 - 1, `x` is the second odd integer in the list**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` has been modified such that the element at the index `idx` (which is the integer part of `(n-1)/2 - 1`) is now the second odd integer `x` in the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
