Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 odd integers, `n` is an odd positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers where the integer at index `idx` is the third odd integer in the list, `prev` is the second odd integer in the list, `idx` is the integer part of (n-1)/2 - 2, `x` is the third odd integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `a[idx]` has been updated to be the third odd integer in the list, which is `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` now has the third odd integer at the index `idx`, which is the integer part of `(n-1)/2 - 2`. The rest of the variables maintain their original values and properties.
