According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `smallList` and `bigList`. If `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` if the original lists had more than two elements. If the original lists had only two elements, `bigList` and `smallList` are empty lists. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `smallList` must have more than one element and `bigList[-1]` must be equal to `smallList[-1]`. Also, `bigList` must be longer than `smallList`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, `bigList` is longer than `smallList`, `len(smallList)` must be greater than 1, and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal**
