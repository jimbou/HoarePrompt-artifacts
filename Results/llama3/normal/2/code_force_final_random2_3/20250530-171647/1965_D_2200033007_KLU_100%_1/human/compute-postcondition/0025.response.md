To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `j`, `i`, and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3, and `a` has a length of at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 4.

The other variables in the loop head, `i` and `a`, do not need to be adjusted. `i` is not used in the loop condition, and `a` is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers with length at least 4, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` plus the sum of the first 4 elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `sm` is equal to the sum of the first 4 elements of `a`, `j` is 4**
