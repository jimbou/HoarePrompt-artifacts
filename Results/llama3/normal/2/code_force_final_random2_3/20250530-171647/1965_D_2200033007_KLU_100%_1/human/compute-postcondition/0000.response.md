To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head. The loop head contains two conditions:

1. `len(smallList) > 0`
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`

Given the initial state:

- `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers.
- `bigList` is longer than `smallList`.
- The last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to verify that both conditions in the loop head are met.

1. For `len(smallList) > 0` to be true, `smallList` must not be empty. Given that `smallList` is already a list of integers and its last element is equal to `bigList`'s last element, we don't need to adjust its state further regarding its length, as the condition is already satisfied by the fact that it has at least one element (the last one that is equal to `bigList`'s last element).

2. For `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, this condition is already satisfied according to the given state. Therefore, no adjustment is needed here.

Given these considerations, the state does not need any adjustments to ensure the loop can execute at least once, as both conditions are already satisfied by the given state.

State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers, `bigList` is longer than `smallList`, and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal.**
