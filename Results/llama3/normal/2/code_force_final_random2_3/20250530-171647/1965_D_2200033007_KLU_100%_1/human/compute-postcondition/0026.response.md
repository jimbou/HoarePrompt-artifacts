Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers with length at least 4, cts is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of a plus the sum of the first 4 elements of a plus the sum of the first 5 elements of a, i is 2, sm is equal to the sum of the first 5 elements of a, j is 4**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `cts` is updated to include the cumulative sum of the elements of `a` plus the sum of the first 4 elements of `a` plus the sum of the first 5 elements of `a`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `sm` is updated to be equal to the sum of the first 5 elements of `a`. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
