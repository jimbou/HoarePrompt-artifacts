The only variables in the loop head are variables  j, i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i` and `a`. If `j` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `i` is 2, `a` has a length of at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3, and `a` must have a length of at least 4.
State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers with length at least 4, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` plus the sum of the first 3 elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `sm` is equal to the sum of the first 3 elements of `a`, `j` is 3**
