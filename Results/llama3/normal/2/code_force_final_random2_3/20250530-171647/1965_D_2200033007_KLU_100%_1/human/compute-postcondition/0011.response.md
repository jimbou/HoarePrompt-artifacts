Postcondition: ***`odds` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 odd integers, `n` is an odd positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `prev` is the first odd integer in the list, `idx` is the integer part of (n-1)/2 - 1, `x` is the second odd integer in the list. If `idx` is equal to `n - 1 - idx`, then the integer part of (n-1)/2 - 1 index in list `a` is the second odd integer in the list. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both equal to `(x - prev) // 2`***
