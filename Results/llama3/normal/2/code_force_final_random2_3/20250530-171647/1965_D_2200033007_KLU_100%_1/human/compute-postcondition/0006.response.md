Output State: **bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are not equal.**

The loop will continue to execute until either the length of smallList is 0 or the last elements of bigList and smallList are not equal. After the loop finishes executing, bigList and smallList will still be lists of integers, and bigList will still be longer than smallList. However, the last elements of bigList and smallList will no longer be equal, as the loop will have removed the equal elements from the end of both lists.
