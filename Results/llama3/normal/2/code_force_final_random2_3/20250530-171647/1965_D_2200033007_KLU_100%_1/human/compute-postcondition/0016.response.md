Postcondition: ***`odds` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 odd integers, `n` is an odd positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers. If `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then the integer at index `idx` is the third odd integer in the list. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both equal to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` is the second odd integer in the list, `idx` is the integer part of `(n-1)/2 - 2`, and `x` is the third odd integer in the list.***
