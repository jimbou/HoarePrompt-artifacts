Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 odd integers, `n` is an odd positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `prev` is the second odd integer in the list, `idx` is the integer part of (n-1)/2 - 2, `x` is the second odd integer in the list. If `idx` is equal to `n - 1 - idx`, then the integer part of (n-1)/2 - 2 index in list `a` is the second odd integer in the list. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are both equal to `(x - prev) // 2`**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to be the second odd integer in the list, which was previously stored in `x`. The value of `idx` has been decremented by 1, changing its value to the integer part of `(n-1)/2 - 2`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
