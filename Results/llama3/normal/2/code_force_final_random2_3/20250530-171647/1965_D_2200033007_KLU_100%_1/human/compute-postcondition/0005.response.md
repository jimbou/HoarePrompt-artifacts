Output State: **bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, len(smallList) is greater than 0, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each removing the last element from `bigList` and `smallList`, respectively. Since the last elements of both lists were equal before the code execution, removing them will not change their relative lengths or the equality of their last elements. However, the length of `smallList` is now greater than 0, as one element has been removed. The lists remain lists of integers, and `bigList` is still longer than `smallList`.
