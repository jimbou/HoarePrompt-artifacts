Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `cts` is a sorted list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` plus the sum of all elements of `a`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `sm` is equal to the last element of `a`, `j` is the last index of `a`.**

The code sorts the list `cts` in ascending order, but does not change the values of the other variables. The list `cts` now contains the same cumulative sums and total sum, but in a sorted order. The other variables `a`, `i`, `sm`, and `j` remain unchanged.
