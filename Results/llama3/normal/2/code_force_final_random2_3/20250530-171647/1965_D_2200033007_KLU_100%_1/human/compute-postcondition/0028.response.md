Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers, cts is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of a plus the sum of all elements of a, i is equal to the length of a, sm is equal to the last element of a, j is the last index of a**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` remains unchanged, the list `cts` contains the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` plus the sum of all elements of `a`, the variable `i` is equal to the length of `a`, the variable `sm` is equal to the last element of `a`, and the variable `j` is equal to the last index of `a`.
