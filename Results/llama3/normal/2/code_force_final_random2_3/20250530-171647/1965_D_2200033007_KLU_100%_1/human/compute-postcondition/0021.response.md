To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `i`, and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`. Since `i` is 2, we need to ensure that the length of `a` is at least 3.

State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers with length at least 3, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of `a`, `i` is 2, `sm` is 0, `j` is 2**
