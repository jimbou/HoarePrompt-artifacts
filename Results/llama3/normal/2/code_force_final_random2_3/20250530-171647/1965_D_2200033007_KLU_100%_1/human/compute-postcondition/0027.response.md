Output State: **a is a list of non-negative integers with length greater than 2, cts is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements of a plus the sum of all elements of a, i is 2, sm is equal to the sum of all elements of a, j is the last index of a**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: the list `a` remains unchanged, the list `cts` now contains the cumulative sums of the elements of `a` plus the total sum of all elements of `a`, the variable `i` remains at 2, the variable `sm` now holds the total sum of all elements of `a`, and the variable `j` has reached the last index of `a`.
