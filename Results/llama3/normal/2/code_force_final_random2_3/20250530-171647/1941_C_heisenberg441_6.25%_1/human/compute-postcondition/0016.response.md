Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed and has 'pie' instead of 'ie', then 'pie' is removed from the string, ans is the number of times 'map' appeared in the initial string plus three**

The code snippet modifies the string `s` and the variable `ans`. The first line of code removes the substring 'pie' from `s`, effectively replacing it with an empty string. The second line increments the value of `ans` by 1. 

Since `s` initially had all occurrences of 'map' removed and 'pie' instead of 'ie', after the code execution, `s` will have 'pie' removed from the string. The value of `ans` is initially the number of times 'map' appeared in the initial string plus two, and after the code execution, it becomes the number of times 'map' appeared in the initial string plus three.
