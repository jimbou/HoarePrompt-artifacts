The variable in the loop head is s, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable s. If s.find('pie') is not equal to -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed and has 'pie' instead of 'ie', then 'pie' is removed from the string. So for the loop to be executed one more time s must have 'pie' again.
State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed and has 'pie' instead of 'ie', ans is the number of times 'map' appeared in the initial string plus two**
