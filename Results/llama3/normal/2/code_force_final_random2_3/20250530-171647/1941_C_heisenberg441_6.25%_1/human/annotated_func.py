#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    if (s == 'mapie') :
        return 1
        #The program returns the number 1
    #State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and s is not equal to 'mapie'
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed, ans is the number of times 'map' appeared in the initial string.
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed and all occurrences of 'pie' removed, ans is the number of times 'map' appeared in the initial string plus the number of times 'pie' appeared in the initial string.
    return ans
    #The program returns the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the original string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input and returns the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the original string. If the input string is exactly 'mapie', it returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' from the string and returns the count of removed substrings.
