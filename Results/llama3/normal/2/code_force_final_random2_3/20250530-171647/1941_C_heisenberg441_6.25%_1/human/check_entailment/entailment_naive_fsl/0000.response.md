Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the string contains both "map" and "pie" and they overlap. For example, if the input string is "mapiepie", the program will remove the first "map" and then the first "pie", but it will not remove the second "pie" because it is not found by the `find` method after the first "pie" is removed. Therefore, the program will return 2, but the correct answer is 3.

Here is an example of how the program can be corrected:

```
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i:i+3] == 'map':
            ans += 1
            i += 3
        elif s[i:i+3] == 'pie':
            ans += 1
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return ans
```

This corrected program iterates over the string character by character, and whenever it finds "map" or "pie", it increments the answer and moves the index 3 characters forward. This way, it correctly handles overlapping substrings.
