According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable s. If s.find('map') is not equal to -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with 'map' removed. So for the loop to be executed one more time s must contain 'map' again.
State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with 'map' removed and s contains 'map', ans is 1**
