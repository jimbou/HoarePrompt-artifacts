Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the total number of occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the original string. If the input string is exactly "mapie", it returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string and returns the count of removed substrings.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly identifies the substrings "map" and "pie" and removes them from the string. The use of the `find()` method to locate the substrings and the slicing operation to remove them is efficient and accurate.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. In the case where the input string is exactly "mapie", the program returns 1, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 2, because both "map" and "pie" need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
