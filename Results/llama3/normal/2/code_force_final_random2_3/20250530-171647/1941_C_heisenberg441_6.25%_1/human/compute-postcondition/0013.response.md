The variable in the loop head is variable s, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable s.  If s.find('pie') != -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed and has 'ie' instead of 'pie'. So for the loop to be executed one more time s must have 'pie' instead of 'ie'.
State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed and has 'pie' instead of 'ie', ans is the number of times 'map' appeared in the initial string plus one**
