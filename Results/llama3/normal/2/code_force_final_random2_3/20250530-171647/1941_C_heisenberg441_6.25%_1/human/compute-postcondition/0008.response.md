The only variable in the loop head is variable s, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable s.  If s.find('map') is not equal to -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with 'map' removed. So for the loop to be executed one more time s must contain 'map' again.
State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with 'map' removed and 'map' is in s, ans is 2**
