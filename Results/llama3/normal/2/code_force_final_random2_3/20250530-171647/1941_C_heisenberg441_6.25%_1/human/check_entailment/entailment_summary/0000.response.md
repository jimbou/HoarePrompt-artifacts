Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. It first checks if the string is exactly 'mapie' and returns 1 in that case. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' from the string and returns the count of removed substrings. This approach ensures that the string is made beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters.

Correctness: **True**
