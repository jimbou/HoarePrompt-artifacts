Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets over n days, considering a maximum purchase limit of m tickets per day. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, m, k) and a list of n integers representing ticket prices.

The program sorts the ticket prices in ascending order, which is a crucial step in finding the minimum cost. It then iteratively calculates the minimum cost by buying the minimum of m and k tickets at the lowest price, and updates the remaining tickets to buy (k). The program also takes into account the increase in ticket prices due to previous purchases.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the edge cases properly. For example, it checks if k is greater than or equal to m before buying tickets, and it updates the remaining tickets to buy (k) accordingly.

However, there is a minor issue with the program. The line `c = k * k / 2` is not necessary and can be removed. The variable `c` is used to store the total minimum cost, and it is updated correctly in the loop.

Despite this minor issue, the program's correctness is not affected, and it produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
