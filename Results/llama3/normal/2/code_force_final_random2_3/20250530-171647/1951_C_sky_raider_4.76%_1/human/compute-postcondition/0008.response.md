Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, k is an integer equal to its original value minus n times the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k * k / 2 plus the sum of l[i] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 for i from 0 to n-1, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be the same as the number of iterations, `m` will remain unchanged, `k` will be reduced by `n` times the minimum of `m` and `k`, the list `l` will remain sorted, `s` will still be the minimum of `m` and `k`, `c` will be the sum of the products of each element in `l` and the minimum of `m` and `k`, minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2, for all indices from 0 to `n-1`, and `i` will be equal to `n`. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged.
