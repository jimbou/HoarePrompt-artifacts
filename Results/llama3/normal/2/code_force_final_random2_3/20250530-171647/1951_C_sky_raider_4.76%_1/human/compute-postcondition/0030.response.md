Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, k is an integer equal to its original value minus n times the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k * k / 2 plus the sum of l[i] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 for all i in range(n), i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains the same as it was initially.
* The value of `m` remains the same as it was initially.
* The value of `k` is reduced by `n` times the minimum of `m` and `k`.
* The list `l` remains the same as it was initially.
* The value of `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
* The value of `c` is the sum of `k * k / 2` and the sum of `l[i]` times the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2 for all `i` in range(`n`).
* The value of `i` is `n`.
* The stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2.

Note that the values of `n`, `m`, `l`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body. Only the values of `k`, `s`, `c`, and `i` are updated based on the loop's execution.
