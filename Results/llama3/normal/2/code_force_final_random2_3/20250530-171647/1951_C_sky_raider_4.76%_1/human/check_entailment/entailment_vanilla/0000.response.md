Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, given the constraints of the problem. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought (k).

3. It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days and stores them in a list (l).

4. The program sorts the list of prices in ascending order.

5. It initializes two variables, s and c. s is used to keep track of the number of tickets purchased on each day, and c is used to keep track of the total cost.

6. The program then iterates over the sorted list of prices. For each price, it calculates the number of tickets that can be purchased on that day (s) as the minimum of m and k. It then subtracts s from k and adds the cost of purchasing s tickets on that day to c. The cost is calculated as the price of the ticket multiplied by s minus s squared divided by 2 (to account for the increase in price due to purchasing tickets).

7. After iterating over all the prices, the program prints the total cost (c) as the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program is not correctly calculating the cost of purchasing tickets. The cost should be calculated as the price of the ticket multiplied by the number of tickets purchased, plus the increase in price due to purchasing tickets. The increase in price should be calculated as the number of tickets purchased squared divided by 2, not subtracted from the cost.

Therefore, the Correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
