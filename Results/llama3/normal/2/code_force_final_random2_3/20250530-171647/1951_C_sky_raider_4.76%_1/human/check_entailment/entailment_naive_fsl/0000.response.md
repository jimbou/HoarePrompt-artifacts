Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The problem description states that the price per ticket increases by x if x tickets are purchased on a day, but the program does not take this into account. It simply sorts the prices and then tries to buy as many tickets as possible on each day, without considering the price increase.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will sort the prices to get [2, 4, 6, 8] and then try to buy 2 tickets on the first day (price 2), 1 ticket on the second day (price 4), and 0 tickets on the remaining days. However, this is not the optimal solution. A better solution would be to buy 1 ticket on the third day (price 4) and 2 tickets on the fourth day (price 6), which would result in a total cost of 10.

The program does not correctly handle the price increase and therefore does not always find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.
