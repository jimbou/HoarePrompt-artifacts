Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, m is an integer, k is an integer equal to its original value minus the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k * k / 2 plus l[0] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `m` also remains the same. The value of `k` is reduced by the minimum of `m` and `k`, which is assigned to `s`. The list `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`. The value of `c` is updated by adding the product of the first element of `l` and `s`, minus the square of `s` divided by 2. The value of `i` remains 0 as it is not modified. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2.
