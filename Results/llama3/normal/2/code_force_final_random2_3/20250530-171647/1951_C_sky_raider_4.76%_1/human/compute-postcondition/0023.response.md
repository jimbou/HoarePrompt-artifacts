Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers, s is 0, c is k * k / 2, i is n + 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integer values read from the input. The list `l` is updated to a sorted list of integers read from the input. The variable `s` is reset to 0. The variable `c` is updated to the value of `k * k / 2`. The variable `i` is not affected by the code and remains `n + 1`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 2, as two lines of input are read.
