Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, m is an integer, k is an integer equal to its original value minus three times the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k * k / 2 plus l[0] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 plus l[1] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 plus l[3] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2, i is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `s`, `k`, and `c`. The first line assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to `s`, which is already the case in the initial state, so `s` remains the same. The second line subtracts the value of `s` from `k`, making `k` equal to its original value minus three times the minimum of `m` and `k`. The third line increments `c` by the value of `l[i]` times `s` minus the square of `s` divided by 2. Since `i` is 3, this adds `l[3]` times the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2 to `c`. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2.
