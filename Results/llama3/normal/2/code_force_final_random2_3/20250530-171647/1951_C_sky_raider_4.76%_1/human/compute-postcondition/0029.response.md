Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, m is an integer, k is an integer equal to its original value minus three times the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k * k / 2 plus l[0] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 plus l[1] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 plus l[3] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2, i is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `m` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `k` is updated to be its original value minus three times the minimum of `m` and `k`, as the code subtracts `s` from `k` and `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`. The value of `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `s` is updated to be the minimum of `m` and `k`, as the code assigns the minimum of `m` and `k` to `s`. The value of `c` is updated to be `k` * `k` / 2 plus `l[0]` times the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2 plus `l[1]` times the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2 plus `l[3]` times the minimum of `m` and `k` minus the square of the minimum of `m` and `k` divided by 2, as the code adds `l[i]` * `s` - `s` * `s` / 2 to `c` and `i` is 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of stdin is updated to contain multiple test cases minus 2, as the code does not modify the number of test cases in stdin.
