Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, m is an integer, k is an integer equal to its original value minus three times the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k * k / 2 plus l[0] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 plus l[1] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 plus l[3] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2, i is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `m` also remains the same as it is not modified. The value of `k` is updated to be its original value minus three times the minimum of `m` and `k`, as the first line assigns the minimum of `m` and `k` to `s`, and the second line subtracts `s` from `k`. The value of `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified. The value of `s` is updated to be the minimum of `m` and `k`. The value of `c` is updated to include the additional term `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, where `i` is 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2.
