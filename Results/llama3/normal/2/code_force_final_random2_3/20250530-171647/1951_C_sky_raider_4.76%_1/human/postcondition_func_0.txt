This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function sorts the integers, calculates a value c based on the sorted integers and the minimum of m and k, and prints the integer value of c. The function repeats this process for all test cases in the input.
