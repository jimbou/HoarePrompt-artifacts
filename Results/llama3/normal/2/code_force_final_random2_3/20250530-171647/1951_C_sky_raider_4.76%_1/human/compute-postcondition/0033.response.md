Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, k is an integer equal to its original value minus n times the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k * k / 2 plus the sum of l[i] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 for all i in range(n), i is n, stdin contains no test cases, and the integer value of c is being printed.**

This output state means that the loop has executed for all test cases in the input, and the final values of the variables are as follows:

- n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, indicating the number of days for the last test case.
- m is an integer, representing the maximum amount of tickets that can be purchased each day for the last test case.
- k is an integer equal to its original value minus n times the minimum of m and k, indicating the remaining number of tickets to be bought after the last test case.
- l is a sorted list of integers, containing the prices per ticket for each day of the last test case.
- s is the minimum of m and k, representing the number of tickets that can be bought on the last day of the last test case.
- c is the total cost of buying the tickets for the last test case, calculated as k * k / 2 plus the sum of l[i] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 for all i in range(n).
- i is n, indicating that the loop has executed for all days of the last test case.
- stdin contains no test cases, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- The integer value of c is being printed, which is the total cost of buying the tickets for the last test case.
