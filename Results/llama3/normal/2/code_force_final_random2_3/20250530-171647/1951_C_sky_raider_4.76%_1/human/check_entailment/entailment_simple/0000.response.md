Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements a greedy algorithm to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The program first sorts the list of ticket prices in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the sorted list, purchasing the minimum of m and k tickets on each day. The cost of purchasing these tickets is added to the total cost, and the number of remaining tickets to be purchased is updated. The program also takes into account the increase in ticket prices due to previous purchases.

The time complexity of the program is O(n log n) due to the sorting of the list, where n is the number of sale days. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the list of ticket prices.

The program correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day (m) and the total number of tickets to be purchased (k).

Correctness: **True**
