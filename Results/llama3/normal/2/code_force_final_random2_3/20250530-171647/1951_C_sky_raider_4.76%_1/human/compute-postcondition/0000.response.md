The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is now 0 and the input must be at least 1.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, `i` is 0, the input must be at least 1**
