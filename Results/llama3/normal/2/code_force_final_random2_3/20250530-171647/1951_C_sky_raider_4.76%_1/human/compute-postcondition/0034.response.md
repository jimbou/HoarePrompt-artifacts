Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, m, k) and a list of n integers representing ticket prices. It calculates the minimum cost to buy k tickets over n days, considering a maximum purchase limit of m tickets per day. The function sorts the ticket prices, iteratively calculates the minimum cost by buying the minimum of m and k tickets at the lowest price, and updates the remaining tickets to buy (k). Finally, it prints the total minimum cost for each test case.**
