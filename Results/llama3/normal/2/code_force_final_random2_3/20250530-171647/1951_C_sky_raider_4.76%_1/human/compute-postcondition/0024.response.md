To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is initialized to `n + 1` before the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range of `n`. 

State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `s` is 0, `c` is `k` * `k` / 2, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2**
