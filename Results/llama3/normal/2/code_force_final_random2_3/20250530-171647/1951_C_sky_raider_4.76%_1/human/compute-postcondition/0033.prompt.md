Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= min(n*m, 10^9)) — the number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought at the end. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    s = 0
    c = k * k / 2
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        k -= s
        c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, k is an integer equal to its original value minus n times the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k * k / 2 plus the sum of l[i] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 for i from 0 to n-1, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, and the integer value of c is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, k is an integer equal to its original value minus n times the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k * k / 2 plus the sum of l[i] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 for all i in range(n), i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, and the integer value of c is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, k is an integer equal to its original value minus n times the minimum of m and k, l is a sorted list of integers, s is the minimum of m and k, c is k * k / 2 plus the sum of l[i] times the minimum of m and k minus the square of the minimum of m and k divided by 2 for all i in range(n), i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, and this is printed: the integer value of c




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
