To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains `t` strings `s` (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'**
