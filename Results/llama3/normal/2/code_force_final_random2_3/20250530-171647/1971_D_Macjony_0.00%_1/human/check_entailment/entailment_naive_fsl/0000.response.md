Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program works by iterating through the input string and counting the number of times the character changes from '0' to '1' or vice versa. This count represents the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the string into, because each change in character requires a new piece.

The program also handles the case where the string is already sorted, in which case it returns 1, because no cuts are needed.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. It does not contain any errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
