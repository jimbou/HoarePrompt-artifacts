Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', s is a string of length at least 5 and at most 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', flag is True, count is 4. If the current value of s[j] is not equal to the current value of s[j + 1], then j is 5 if the current value of s[4] is '1' and the current value of s[5] is '0', otherwise j is 4. Otherwise, j is 3 and j is less than len(s) - 1, and the current value of s[j] is '1'.***
