Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` strings `s` (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1`, `s` is a string of length at least 2 and at most 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1` and is the last string read from `stdin`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `j` is 1, `count` is 2, `flag` is True if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` is False. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `j` is 0, `count` is 1, and `flag` is False.***
