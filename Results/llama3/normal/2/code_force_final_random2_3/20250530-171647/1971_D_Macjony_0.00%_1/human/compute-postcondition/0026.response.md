Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', s is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', j is equal to the length of string s minus 1. If there exists a pair of adjacent characters in string s where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1', then count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in string s that are different minus 1. Otherwise, count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in string s that are different.***
