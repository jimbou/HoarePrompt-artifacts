Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` strings, `s` is a string of length at least 3 consisting of characters '0' and '1` and is the last string read from `stdin`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', `j` is either 2 or 3, `count` is either 2 or 3, and `flag` is True. Otherwise, `j` is 1, `count` is 2, and `flag` is False. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `j` is 1, `count` is 1, and `flag` is False.***
