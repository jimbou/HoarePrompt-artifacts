Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin contains t-3 strings s (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', s is a string of length at least 4 and at most 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', count is 3, flag is True. If the current value of s[j] is '0' and the current value of s[j + 1] is '1', then j is 3 and j is less than len(s) - 1. Otherwise, j is 2 and j is less than len(s) - 1, and the current value of s[j] is '1'.***
