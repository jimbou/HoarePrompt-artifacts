Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', s is a string of length at least 2 consisting of characters '0' and '1', count is 2. If the current character at index j in string s is '0' and the character at index j + 1 is '1', then flag is True, j is 1, and the current character at index j in string s is '1'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
