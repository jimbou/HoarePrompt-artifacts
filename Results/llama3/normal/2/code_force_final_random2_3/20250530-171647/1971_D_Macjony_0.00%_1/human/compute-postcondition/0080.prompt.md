Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', s is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1' and is the last string read from stdin, j is 0, count is 1, flag is False.
Code of the loop:
while j < len(s) - 1:
    if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
        count += 1
        if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
            flag = True
            j += 1
    j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` strings, `s` is a string of length at least 2 and at most 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1` and is the last string read from `stdin`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `j` is 2, `count` is 2, `flag` is True if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` is False. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `j` is 1, `count` is 1, and `flag` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-6` strings, `s` is a string of length at least 3 consisting of characters '0' and '1` and is the last string read from `stdin`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', `j` is either 3 or 4, `count` is either 2 or 3, and `flag` is True. Otherwise, `j` is 2, `count` is 2, and `flag` is False. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `j` is 2, `count` is 1, and `flag` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-7` strings if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-6` strings, `s` is a string of length at least 4 consisting of characters '0' and '1` and is the last string read from `stdin`, `j` is either 4 or 5 if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `j` is either 3, 4 or 5, `j` is less than `len(s) - 1`, `count` is increased by 1 and `flag` is True if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
