Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is 2, stdin contains t-5 strings s (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', s is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1' and is the last string read from stdin, j is equal to len(s) - 1, count is the number of times '0' and '1' alternate in s plus 1, and the current value of flag is True, indicating that '0' and '1' alternate in s and the first character of s is '0'.**
