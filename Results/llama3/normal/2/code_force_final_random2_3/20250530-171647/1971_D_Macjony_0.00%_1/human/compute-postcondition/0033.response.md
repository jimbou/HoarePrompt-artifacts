Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings `s` (1 <= len(s) <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string of length at least 2 and at most 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `j` is 0, `count` is 2, `flag` is False. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[j + 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 2. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `s[j]` and `s[j + 1]` still hold.
