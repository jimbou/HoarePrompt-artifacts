Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is 3 and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt[x]` being 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still has at least 3 elements, and `x` is still the third element in the list. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the variable `_` remains 0.
