Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and the rest are the number of occurrences of their respective indices in `a`, `x` is the last element in the list `a`, `ans` is undefined, `stdin` contains no input, _ is n+1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the count of each integer in list `a` stored in the corresponding index of list `cnt`. The variable `x` will hold the last element of list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
