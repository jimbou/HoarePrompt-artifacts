The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`. 

Since `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, and `a` is an empty list, all elements in `cnt` are 0.

Therefore, `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` will be 0, and the sum of these values will also be 0.

Output: **0**
