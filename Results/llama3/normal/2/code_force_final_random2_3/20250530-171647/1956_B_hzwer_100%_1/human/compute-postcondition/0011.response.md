Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains a positive integer, the list `a` is still empty, the variable `x` is still undefined, the list `cnt` still contains the count of occurrences of each index in the original list `a`, and a new variable `ans` is introduced with a value of 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the variable `_` remains 0.
