Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) â€” the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. input is now set to sys.stdin.readline**

The code sets the input function to sys.stdin.readline, which allows for faster input reading. The initial state of the stdin remains the same, with multiple test cases containing two inputs each: an integer n and a list of n integers. The values of n and the list of integers are still valid and unchanged.
