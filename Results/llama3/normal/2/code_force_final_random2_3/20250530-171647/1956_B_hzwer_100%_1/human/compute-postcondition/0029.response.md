Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is an empty list, cnt is a list of n+1 integers where cnt[x] is increased by 1 for all x in a, x is the last element in the cnt, ans is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all x in cnt, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 1**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because all its elements have been processed, the count of each element in `a` will be stored in the corresponding index of the list `cnt`, the variable `x` will hold the last element of the list `cnt`, and the variable `ans` will hold the sum of the maximum of 0 and each element in `cnt` minus 1. The other variables `n`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged.
