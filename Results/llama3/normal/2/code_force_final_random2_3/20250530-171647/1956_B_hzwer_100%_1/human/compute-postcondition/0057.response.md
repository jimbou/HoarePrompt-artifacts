The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated sum of max(0, y - 1) for all y in cnt.

Since `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and the rest are the number of occurrences of their respective indices in `a`, and `ans` is the sum of max(0, y - 1) for all y in cnt, the print statement will output the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between each count and 1.

In other words, for each count in `cnt`, if the count is greater than 1, the difference between the count and 1 is added to the sum; otherwise, 0 is added to the sum.

Output: **the sum of max(0, y - 1) for all y in cnt (where y represents the counts in cnt)**
