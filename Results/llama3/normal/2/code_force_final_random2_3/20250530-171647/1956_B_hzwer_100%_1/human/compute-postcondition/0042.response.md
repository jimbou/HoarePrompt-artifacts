According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of n+1 zeros, `x` is undefined, `ans` is undefined, `stdin` contains no input, and `_` is n+1. For the loop to be executed, `a` must have at least 1 element and `x` is the first element in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is a list of n+1 zeros, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, `ans` is undefined, `stdin` contains no input, _ is n+1**
