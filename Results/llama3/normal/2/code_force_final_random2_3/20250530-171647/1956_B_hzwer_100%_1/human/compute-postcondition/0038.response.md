The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.

Since `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1 for all `x` in `a`, and `a` is an empty list, `cnt[x]` is 0 for all `x` in `cnt`. Therefore, `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` is 0 for all `x` in `cnt`.

The sum of 0 for all `x` in `cnt` is 0.

Output: **0**
