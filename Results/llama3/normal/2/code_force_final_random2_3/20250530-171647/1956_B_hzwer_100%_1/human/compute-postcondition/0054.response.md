To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for x in cnt:`, which means the loop iterates over the elements of the list `cnt`. The only object in the loop head is `x`, which takes on the value of each element in `cnt` during each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the second element in the list `cnt`. For the loop to execute again, `x` should be the next element in the list `cnt`.

Since `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers, and `x` is currently the second element, the next element would be the third element in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and the rest are the number of occurrences of their respective indices in `a` and `cnt` is not empty, `x` is the third element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is 2*max(0, x - 1), `stdin` contains no input, _ is n+1**

Note that only the state of `x` has changed, as it is the only object in the loop head. The other variables remain unchanged.
