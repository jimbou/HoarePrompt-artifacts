Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) â€” the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. input is now set to sys.stdin.readline
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] += 1
    ans = 0
    for x in cnt:
        ans += max(0, x - 1)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is the last element in the `cnt`, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a` and must have at least `n+1` elements, `ans` is equal to the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, and the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1 for all `x` in `a`, `x` is the last element in `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n+1` inputs, `_` is `n`, and the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and the rest are the number of occurrences of their respective indices in `a` and `cnt` is not empty, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of max(0, y - 1) for all y in cnt, `stdin` contains no input, _ is n+1, and the sum of max(0, y - 1) for all y in cnt which is equal to ans is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
