To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for x in a:`, which means the loop iterates over the elements of list `a`. The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `n` is a positive integer
* `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements
* `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1
* `x` is the second element in the list `a`
* `ans` is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all x in cnt
* stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs
* _ is 1

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head. Since the loop iterates over the elements of list `a`, we need to move to the next element in the list.

The only object in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `x`, which is the current element being processed. Since `x` is currently the second element in the list `a`, we need to move to the next element in the list.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all x in cnt, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 1**
