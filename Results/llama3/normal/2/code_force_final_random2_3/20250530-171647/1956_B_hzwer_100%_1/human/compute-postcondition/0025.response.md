To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` must be the second element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all x in cnt, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 1**
