According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cnt`. If `cnt` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and the rest are the number of occurrences of their respective indices in `a`, so it needs to be adjusted to `cnt` is not empty and `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`. 
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and the rest are the number of occurrences of their respective indices in `a` and `cnt` is not empty, `x` is the first element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, _ is n+1**
