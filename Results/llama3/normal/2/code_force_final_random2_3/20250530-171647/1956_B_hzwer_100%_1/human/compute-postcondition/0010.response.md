Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 0**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because the loop iterates over all its elements. The variable `x` will be undefined because it is no longer being assigned a value from the list `a`. The list `cnt` will contain the count of each integer from 0 to `n` based on their occurrences in the original list `a`. The other variables `n`, stdin, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
