The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and cnt, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cnt.  If the cnt has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, ans is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the cnt must have at least 1 element and the x is the first element in the cnt.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is the first element in the cnt, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a` and must have at least 1 element, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 0**
