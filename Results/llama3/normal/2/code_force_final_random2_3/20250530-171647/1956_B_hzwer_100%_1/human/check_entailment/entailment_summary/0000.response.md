Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The program reads the input, counts the occurrences of each integer in the list, and calculates the sum of the maximum of 0 and the count minus 1 for each integer. This sum represents the maximum number of points the player can get by taking their turns optimally.

The program uses a list `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. It then iterates over the `cnt` list and calculates the sum of the maximum of 0 and the count minus 1 for each integer. This sum is stored in the variable `ans`. Finally, the program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of integers in the list. This is because the program iterates over the list twice: once to count the occurrences of each integer and once to calculate the sum.

The space complexity of the program is also O(n), as it uses a list of size n+1 to count the occurrences of each integer.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
