The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the range of the loop. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the range of the loop. If `_` is less than the range of the loop, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `n`, the range of the loop is `n+1`. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again the range of the loop must be greater than `n+1`. Also, the range of the loop is defined by the number of inputs in stdin, so for the loop to execute again stdin must contain at least one more input.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1 for all `x` in `a`, `x` is the last element in `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, stdin contains at least one input, `_` is `n+1`, and the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` is printed**
