Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game, assuming the opponent plays optimally. The game involves distributing 2n cards between two players, with each card having an integer from 1 to n. The player's goal is to maximize their score by selecting cards that will give them points.

The provided program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and iterating over each case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cards (n) and the integers on the cards in the player's hand (a).
3. It initializes a count array (cnt) of size n+1 to keep track of the frequency of each integer.
4. It iterates over the integers in the player's hand and increments the corresponding count in the cnt array.
5. It initializes a variable (ans) to store the maximum number of points the player can score.
6. It iterates over the cnt array and adds the maximum of 0 and the count minus 1 to the ans variable. This is because the player can score points only if they have more than one card with the same integer.
7. Finally, it prints the maximum number of points the player can score.

The program's approach is correct because it:

* Accurately counts the frequency of each integer in the player's hand.
* Correctly calculates the maximum number of points the player can score by considering only the integers with more than one occurrence.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the output will match the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
