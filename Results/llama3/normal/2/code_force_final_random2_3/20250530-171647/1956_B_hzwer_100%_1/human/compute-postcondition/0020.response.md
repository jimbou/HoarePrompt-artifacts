Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is the last element in the `cnt`, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a` and must have at least `n+1` elements, `ans` is equal to the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0, and the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` is being printed**
