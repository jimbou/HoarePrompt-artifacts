Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1 for all `x` in `a`, `x` is the third element in `cnt`, `ans` is `4 * max(0, x - 1)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `_` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `4 * max(0, x - 1)`, which is twice its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, and the value of `_` remains 2.
