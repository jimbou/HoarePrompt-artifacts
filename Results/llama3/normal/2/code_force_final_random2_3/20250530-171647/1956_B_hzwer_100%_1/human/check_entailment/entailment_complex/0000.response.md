Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in the player's hand.
3.  It initializes a list `cnt` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. This is done to efficiently count the occurrences of each integer in the list.
4.  The program then iterates over the list `cnt` and calculates the sum of the maximum of 0 and the count minus 1 for each integer. This is done to calculate the maximum number of points the player can score.
5.  Finally, the program prints the calculated sum for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately solves the problem. The use of the `cnt` list to count the occurrences of each integer is efficient, and the calculation of the sum of the maximum of 0 and the count minus 1 for each integer is correct.

Therefore, the correctness of the given Python program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
