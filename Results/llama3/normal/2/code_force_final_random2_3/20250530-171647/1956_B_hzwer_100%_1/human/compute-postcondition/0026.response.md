Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all x in cnt, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 1**

The code increments the value of `cnt[x]` by 1, where `x` is the second element in the list `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The state of `cnt` is updated to reflect the increment of `cnt[x]`. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
