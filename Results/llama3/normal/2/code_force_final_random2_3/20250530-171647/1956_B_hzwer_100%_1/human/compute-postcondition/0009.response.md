Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is undefined, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where each `cnt[i]` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 0

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because all its elements have been processed, `x` will be undefined because it's no longer being assigned a value, and `cnt` will contain the count of each integer from 0 to `n` based on their occurrences in the original list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
