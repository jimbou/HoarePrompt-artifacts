Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1 for all `x` in `a`, `x` is the last element in `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n+1` inputs, `_` is `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains a positive integer, `a` remains an empty list, `cnt` remains a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cnt[x]` is increased by 1 for all `x` in `a`, `x` is now the last element in `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n+1` inputs, and `_` is now `n`.
