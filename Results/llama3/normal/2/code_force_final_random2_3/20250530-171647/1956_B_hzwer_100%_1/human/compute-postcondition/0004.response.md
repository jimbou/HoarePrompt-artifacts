Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is 1 and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1, making it 1, while the rest of the elements in the `cnt` list remain 0. The other variables, `n`, `a`, `x`, and `_`, retain their original values, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
