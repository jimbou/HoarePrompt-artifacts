Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers, cnt is a list of n+1 zeros, x is the last element in the cnt, ans is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all x in cnt, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 1**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Then, it assigns a list of `n` integers from the input to `a`. The third line creates a list of `n+1` zeros and assigns it to `cnt`. The value of `x` is still the last element in the `cnt`, which is 0. The value of `ans` is still the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, which is 0. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The value of `_` remains 1.
