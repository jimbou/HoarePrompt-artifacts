Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all x in cnt, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt[x]` is increased by 1, where `x` is the first element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `cnt` now has `n+1` integers where the value at index `x` is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables and stdin remain the same as in the initial state.
