Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. It initializes a list `cnt` of size `n+1` to keep track of the count of each integer from 1 to `n` in the list `a`. This is done to count the occurrences of each integer in the list.

3. It then iterates over the list `a` and increments the count of each integer in the list `cnt`.

4. After that, it initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum number of points that can be scored.

5. It then iterates over the list `cnt` and for each count `x`, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans`. This is because if the count of an integer is greater than 1, it means that the integer appears at least twice in the list `a`, and therefore, the player can score at least one point by playing the integer. The `max` function is used to ensure that the score is not negative.

6. Finally, it prints the maximum number of points that can be scored, which is stored in `ans`.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player, and it handles all the possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
