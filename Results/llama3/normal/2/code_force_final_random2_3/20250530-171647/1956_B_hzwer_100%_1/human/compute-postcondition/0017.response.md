Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is the third element in the `cnt`, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a` and must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is equal to `3*max(0, x - 1)`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `3*max(0, x - 1)`, which is the result of adding `max(0, x - 1)` to its previous value `2*max(0, x - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
