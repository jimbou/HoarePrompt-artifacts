The only object in the loop head is variable `x` and list `cnt`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cnt`. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1 for all `x` in `a`, `x` is the last element in `cnt`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the `x` is the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1 for all `x` in `a`, `x` is the first element in `cnt`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1**
