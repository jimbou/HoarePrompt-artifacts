Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and the rest are the number of occurrences of their respective indices in `a`, `x` is the last element in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, _ is n+1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `cnt` still contains the count of occurrences of each element in `a` and the count of occurrences of their respective indices in `a`. The variable `x` is still the last element in the list `a`. The input `stdin` is still empty, and the value of `_` is still `n+1`.
