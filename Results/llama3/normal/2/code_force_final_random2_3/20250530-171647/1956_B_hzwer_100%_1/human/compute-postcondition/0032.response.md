Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1 for all `x` in `a`, `x` is the first element in `cnt`, `ans` is `max(0, x - 1)`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1**

The value of `ans` is increased by the maximum of 0 and `x - 1`, where `x` is the first element in `cnt`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
