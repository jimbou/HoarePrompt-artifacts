Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is 2 and the rest are 0, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `ans` is undefined, `stdin` contains no input, _ is n+1**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been updated to 2, as it was incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `cnt` still has n+1 elements, but now `cnt[x]` has a value of 2, while the rest of the elements are still 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `x`, `ans`, `stdin`, and `_` are the same as in the initial state.
