To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `x` and the list `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of `n` integers, we can conclude that `a` has at least 1 element.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to ensure it has at least 1 element, and we can also adjust the state of `x` to be the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, `ans` is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all x in cnt, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 1**
