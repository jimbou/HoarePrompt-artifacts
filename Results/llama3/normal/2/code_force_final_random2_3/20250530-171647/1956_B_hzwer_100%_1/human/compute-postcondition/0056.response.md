Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and the rest are the number of occurrences of their respective indices in `a` and `cnt` is not empty, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of max(0, y - 1) for all y in cnt, `stdin` contains no input, _ is n+1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has iterated over all elements in the `cnt` list, and the value of `ans` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and each element in `cnt` minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
