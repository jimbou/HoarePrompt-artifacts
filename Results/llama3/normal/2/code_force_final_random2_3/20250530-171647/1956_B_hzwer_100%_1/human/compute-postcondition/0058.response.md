The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `max(0, y - 1)` for all `y` in `cnt`. Here, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and the rest are the number of occurrences of their respective indices in `a`. Since `cnt` is not empty, `ans` will be a non-negative integer.

Output: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and the rest are the number of occurrences of their respective indices in `a` and `cnt` is not empty, `x` is the last element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of max(0, y - 1) for all y in cnt, `stdin` contains no input, _ is n+1, and the sum of max(0, y - 1) for all y in cnt which is equal to ans is being printed**
