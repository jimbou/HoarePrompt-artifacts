Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers, cnt is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 0**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `input()` is greater than 0, `n` becomes a positive integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The third line initializes `cnt` as a list of `n+1` zeros. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
