Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1 for all `x` in `a`, `x` is the last element in `cnt`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `_` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `cnt` still has `n+1` integers, but its values are not affected by the code. The list `a` is still empty, and `x` is still the last element in `cnt`. The input in stdin is also unaffected, with multiple test cases minus 2 inputs remaining. The variable `_` is still equal to 1.
