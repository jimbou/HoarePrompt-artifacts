The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, x is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the x is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is 2 and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 0**
