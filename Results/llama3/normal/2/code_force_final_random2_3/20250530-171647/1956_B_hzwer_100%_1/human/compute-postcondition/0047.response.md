Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is 3 and the rest are 0, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `ans` is undefined, `stdin` contains no input, _ is n+1**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been updated to 3, as it was incremented by 1 from its initial value of 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
