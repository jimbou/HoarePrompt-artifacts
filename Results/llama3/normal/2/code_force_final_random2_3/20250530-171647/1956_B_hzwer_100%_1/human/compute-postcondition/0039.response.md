Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cnt[x]` is increased by 1 for all `x` in `a`, `x` is the last element in `cnt`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n+1` inputs, `_` is `n`, and the sum of `max(0, cnt[x] - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` is printed**
