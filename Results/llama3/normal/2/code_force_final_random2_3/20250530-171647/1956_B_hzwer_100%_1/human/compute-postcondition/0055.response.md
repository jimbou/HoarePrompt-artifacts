Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is the number of occurrences of `x` in `a` and the rest are the number of occurrences of their respective indices in `a` and `cnt` is not empty, `x` is the third element in the list `cnt`, `ans` is 3*max(0, x - 1), `stdin` contains no input, _ is n+1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 3 times the maximum of 0 and `x-1`, where `x` is the third element in the list `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.
