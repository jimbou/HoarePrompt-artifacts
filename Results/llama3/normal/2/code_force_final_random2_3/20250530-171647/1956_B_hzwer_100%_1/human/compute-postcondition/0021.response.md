The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the range, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the range. If `_` is less than the range, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and the range is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 1 and the range must be at least 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `x` is the last element in the `cnt`, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the original list `a` and must have at least `n+1` elements, `ans` is equal to the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, `_` is 1, and the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` is being printed**
