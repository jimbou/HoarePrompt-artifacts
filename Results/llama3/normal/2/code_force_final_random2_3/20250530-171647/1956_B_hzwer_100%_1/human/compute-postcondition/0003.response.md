The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, cnt is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the x is the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list, `cnt` is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, _ is 0**
