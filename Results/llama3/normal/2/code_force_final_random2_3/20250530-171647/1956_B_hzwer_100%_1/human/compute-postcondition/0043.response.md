Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is a list of n+1 integers where `cnt[x]` is 1 and the rest are 0, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, `ans` is undefined, `stdin` contains no input, _ is n+1**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other elements of `cnt` remain 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `x`, `ans`, `stdin`, and `_` are unchanged.
