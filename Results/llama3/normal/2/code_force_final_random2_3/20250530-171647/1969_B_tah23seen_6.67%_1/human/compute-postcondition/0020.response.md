To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `left < len(s) and s[left] != '1'`.

Given the initial state:

- `sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1'.
- `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`.
- `i` is the last character in the string.
- `right` is less than `len(s)` and points to a character that is '0' or `right` is equal to `len(s)`.

However, the loop condition involves `left` and `s[left]`, but the initial state does not specify `left`. Since `left` is not defined in the initial state, we must infer its necessary condition from the loop condition itself.

For the loop to execute at least once, two conditions must be met:

1. `left` must be less than `len(s)`.
2. `s[left]` must not be '1'.

Given that `sChar`'s first character is '1' and this is reflected in `s`, for `s[left]` to not be '1', `left` must not point to the first character of `s` initially. However, without a specific value for `left`, we can only ensure the loop executes by making sure `left` is within the bounds of `s` and does not point to the first character ('1').

Thus, the adjusted state to ensure the loop can execute at least once, focusing only on the variables involved in the loop condition (`left` and `s[left]`), is:

State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1', `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string, `right` is less than `len(s)` and points to a character that is '0' or `right` is equal to `len(s)`, and `left` is greater than 0 and less than `len(s)`.**

This adjustment ensures that `left` is within the bounds of `s` and does not point to the first character ('1'), thus allowing the loop to potentially execute at least once based on the condition `s[left] != '1'`.
