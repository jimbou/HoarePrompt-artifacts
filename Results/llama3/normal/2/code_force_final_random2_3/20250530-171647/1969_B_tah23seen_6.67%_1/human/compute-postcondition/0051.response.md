The variables in the loop head are `right` and `s[right]`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `right` and `s[right]`. If `right` is less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` is not equal to `'0'`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is either less than `len(s)` or equal to `len(s)`, and `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`. Since `right` being equal to `len(s)` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, we need to adjust it to `right` is less than `len(s)`. Additionally, since `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, we need to adjust `s[right]` to be not equal to `'0'`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`right` is less than `len(s)`, `s[right]` is not equal to `'0'`, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)-1`, `s[left]` is equal to `'1'`**
