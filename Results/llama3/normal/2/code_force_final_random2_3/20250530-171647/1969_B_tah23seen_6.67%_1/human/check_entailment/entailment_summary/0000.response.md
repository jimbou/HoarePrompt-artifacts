Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `sChar` as input and returns the minimum total cost.

The function `func_1` works by iterating through the string from left to right, swapping adjacent 0s and 1s whenever it encounters a pair of characters that are in the wrong order. The cost of each swap is calculated as the distance between the two characters being swapped, plus 1. The total cost is accumulated and returned at the end of the function.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. The execution summary confirms that the program modifies the input string in-place by swapping the characters and returns the total number of swaps performed as the cost.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. The problem statement allows for cyclic shifts, which means that the program should be able to handle cases where the optimal solution involves shifting the entire string. The current implementation does not explicitly handle this case, and it may not produce the correct result for inputs where the optimal solution involves a cyclic shift.

For example, consider the input string "10". The optimal solution is to perform a cyclic shift, resulting in the string "01", which has a cost of 2. However, the current implementation would swap the two characters, resulting in a cost of 1, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
