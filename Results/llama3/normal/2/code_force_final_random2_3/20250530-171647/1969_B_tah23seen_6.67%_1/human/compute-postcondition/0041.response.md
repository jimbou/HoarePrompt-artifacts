According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `s[left]`. If `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not equal to `'1'`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, and `s[left]` is not equal to `'1'`. However, `left` being less than or equal to `len(s)` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `left` is less than `len(s)`. Additionally, `s[left]` being not equal to `'1'` is already satisfied, so no adjustment is needed for `s[left]`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, and `s[left]` is not equal to `'1'`**
