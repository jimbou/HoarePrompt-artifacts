Output State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, and `s[left]` is not equal to `'1'`**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been incremented by 1, making it less than or equal to `len(s)`. The other conditions remain the same, as the values of `right`, `s[right-1]`, and `s[left]` are not affected by the code.
