Postcondition: ***`right` is equal to `len(s)-1`, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)-1`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, and `s[left]` is equal to `'1'`. If `s[right]` is `'0'` and `s[left]` is `'1'`, then `right` is equal to `len(s)-1`, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)-1`, `s[right-1]` is equal to `'1'`, `s[left]` is not equal to `'0'`, and `cost` is increased by `right - left + 1`.***
