Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input string "101". The program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1. The program is not correctly implementing the cyclic shift operation.

In the given program, the function `func_1` is trying to sort the binary string by swapping '0' and '1' characters. However, it is not considering the cyclic shift operation correctly. The program is only checking for adjacent '0' and '1' characters and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. But this approach is not sufficient to solve the problem.

A correct approach would be to count the number of '1' characters in the string and then find the minimum cost to move all '1' characters to the right side of the string. This can be done by finding the longest contiguous substring of '0' characters and then moving all '1' characters to the right of this substring.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
