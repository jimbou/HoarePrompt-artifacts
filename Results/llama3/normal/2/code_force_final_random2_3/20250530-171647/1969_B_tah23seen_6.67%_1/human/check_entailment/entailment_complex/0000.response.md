Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts.

The program iterates through the string from left to right, swapping adjacent 0s and 1s whenever it encounters a 0 followed by a 1. The cost of each swap is added to the total cost. The program uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to keep track of the current position in the string. The `left` pointer moves to the right whenever it encounters a 1, and the `right` pointer moves to the right whenever it encounters a 0.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the string is already sorted or when the string consists of only 0s or only 1s.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because it makes a single pass through the string. The space complexity is O(n) because it creates a list to store the characters of the string.

Therefore, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
