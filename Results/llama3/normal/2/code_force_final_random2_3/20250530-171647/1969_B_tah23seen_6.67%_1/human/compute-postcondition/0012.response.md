Postcondition: ***`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `left` is 1, `right` is 0, the character at the `right` index of `s` is '1', the character at the `left` index of `s` is '0', and `cost` is 2. Otherwise, the values of `left`, `right`, `s[right]`, `s[left]`, and `cost` remain unchanged.***
