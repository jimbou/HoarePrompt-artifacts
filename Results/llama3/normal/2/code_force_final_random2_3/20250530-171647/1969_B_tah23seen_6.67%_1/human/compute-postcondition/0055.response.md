Output State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, `s[left-1]` is equal to `'0'`**

The code increments the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was initially less than or equal to `len(s)-1`, after the increment, it is now less than or equal to `len(s)`. The other conditions remain the same: `right` is still equal to `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, and since `left` was incremented, `s[left-1]` is now equal to `'0'`.
