Functionality: **This function takes a string of 0s and 1s as input, swaps adjacent 0s and 1s in the string from left to right, and returns the total number of swaps performed. The function modifies the input string in-place by swapping the characters. The final state of the program is that the input string has been modified to have all 0s on the right and all 1s on the left, and the total number of swaps performed is returned as the cost.**
