The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `right` was greater than or equal to `left` and less than `len(s)`, so the new value of `right` is either equal to `len(s)` or still less than `len(s)`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`left` is less than `len(s)`, `right` is either equal to `len(s)` or greater than `left` and less than `len(s)`.**
