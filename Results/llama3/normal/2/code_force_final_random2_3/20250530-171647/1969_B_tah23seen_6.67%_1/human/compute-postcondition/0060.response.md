Output State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, `left` is equal to `len(s)`, `s[left-1]` is not equal to `'1'`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop finishes executing, the value of `left` will be equal to the length of the string `s`, and the character at the index `left-1` will not be `'1'`. The value of `right` remains unchanged, equal to the length of the string `s`, and the character at the index `right-1` is still not equal to `'0'`.
