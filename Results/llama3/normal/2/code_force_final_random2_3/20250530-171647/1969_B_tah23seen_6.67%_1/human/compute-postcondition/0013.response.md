To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `right < len(s)` and `s[right] != '0'`.

1. **`right < len(s)`**: This condition is already satisfied because `right` is initialized to 0, and the length of `s` (which is the same as the length of `sChar`) is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). Therefore, `right` is less than `len(s)`.

2. **`s[right] != '0'`**: This condition needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute. Since `right` is 0, `s[right]` refers to the first character of `s` (or `sChar`). For this condition to be true, the first character of `sChar` must not be '0'. It must be '1'.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that the first character of `sChar` is '1'.

State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1', `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string.**
