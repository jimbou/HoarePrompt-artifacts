To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `right` and `s` (or more specifically, the character at index `right` in `s`).

1. `right` needs to be less than `len(s)`, which means it should not have reached the end of the string `s`. Since `right` is increased by 1 in each iteration, we can ensure this by making sure `right` is still less than `len(s) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

2. `s[right]` should not be '0'. Since `s[right]` is the character at index `right` in `s`, we need to ensure that this character is not '0'. However, we cannot directly change the character in `s`, as we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head. Instead, we can adjust the state of `right` to point to a character that is not '0'.

Considering these adjustments, the modified state would be:

State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1', `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string, and `right` is less than `len(s) - 1` and points to a character that is not '0'**
