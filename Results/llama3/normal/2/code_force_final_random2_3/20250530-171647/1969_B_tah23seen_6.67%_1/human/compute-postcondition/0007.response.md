Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the string `sChar` remains unchanged, still consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). The list `s` now contains all characters of `sChar`, effectively becoming a copy of `sChar` but in list form. The variable `i` holds the last character of the string `sChar`.
