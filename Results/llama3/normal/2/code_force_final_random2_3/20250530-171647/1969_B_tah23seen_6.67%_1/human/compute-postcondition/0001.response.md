According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sChar`. If `sChar` has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the string `sChar` must have at least 1 character and the variable `i` is the first character in the string.
State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is an empty list, `i` is the first character in the string**
