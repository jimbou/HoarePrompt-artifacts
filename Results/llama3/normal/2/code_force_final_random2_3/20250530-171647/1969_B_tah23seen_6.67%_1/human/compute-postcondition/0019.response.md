Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1', `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string, and `right` is less than `len(s)` and points to a character that is '0' or `right` is equal to `len(s)`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `sChar` remains unchanged, consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1'. The list `s` still contains all characters of `sChar`, and `i` remains the last character in the string. The variable `right` will either point to a character that is '0' or will be equal to the length of the string `s`, indicating that it has reached the end of the string or found a '0' character.
