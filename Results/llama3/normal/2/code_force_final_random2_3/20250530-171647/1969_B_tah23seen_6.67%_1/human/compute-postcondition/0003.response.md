To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head consists of the variable `i` and the string `sChar`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a list containing the first character of `sChar`, and `i` is the first character in the string.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be the next character in the string `sChar`. Since `i` is currently the first character, it should be the second character in the next iteration. Also, `sChar` should have at least one more character for the loop to execute again.

State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 3 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a list containing the first character of `sChar`, `i` is the second character in the string**
