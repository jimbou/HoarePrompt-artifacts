Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 3 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a list containing the first three characters of `sChar`, `i` is the third character in the string**

In this output state, the length of `sChar` remains the same, and it still consists of only 0-s and/or 1-s. The list `s` now contains the first three characters of `sChar`, which were previously the first two characters and the third character `i`. The value of `i` remains the same, which is the third character in the string `sChar`.
