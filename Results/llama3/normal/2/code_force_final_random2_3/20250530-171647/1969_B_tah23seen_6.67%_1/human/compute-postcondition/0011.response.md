Output State: **sChar is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), s is a list containing all characters of sChar, i is the last character in the string, left is 1, right is 0, the character at the right index of s is '1' and the character at the left index of s is '0', cost is 2.**

The code snippet swaps the characters at the `right` and `left` indices of the list `s`, and then increments the `cost` by the difference between `right` and `left` plus 1. Since `right` is initially 1 and `left` is initially 0, the characters at these indices are swapped, and `cost` is incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
