Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1', `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string, `right` is less than `len(s)` and points to a character that is '0' or `right` is equal to `len(s)`, and `left` is greater than 1 and less than `len(s)`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The string `sChar` remains the same, consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is still '1'. The list `s` also remains the same, containing all characters of `sChar`. The variable `i` still points to the last character in the string. The variable `right` still points to a character that is '0' or is equal to `len(s)`. The only change is that the variable `left` has been incremented by 1, so it is now greater than 1 and less than `len(s)`.
