The variables in the loop head are left, right, and s, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables left, right, and s. If left is less than or equal to right and right is less than len(s) and left is less than len(s), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, left is equal to len(s), so for the loop to be executed one more time left must be less than len(s) and right must be greater than or equal to left and right must be less than len(s).
State: **left is less than len(s), right is greater than or equal to left and right is less than len(s)**
