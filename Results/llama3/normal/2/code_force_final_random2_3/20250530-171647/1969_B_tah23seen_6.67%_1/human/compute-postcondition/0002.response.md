Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a list containing the first character of `sChar`, `i` is the first character in the string**

In this output state, the string `sChar` remains unchanged, still consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is still between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). The list `s` now contains the first character of `sChar`, which is also the value of `i`. The value of `i` itself remains the same, still being the first character in the string `sChar`.
