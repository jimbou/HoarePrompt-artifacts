Output State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, and `s[left]` is equal to `'1'`**

The loop will continue to execute as long as `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not equal to `'1'`. After each iteration, `left` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the loop will terminate when `left` is equal to `len(s)` or when `s[left]` is equal to `'1'`. At this point, `right` will still be equal to `len(s)`, and `s[right-1]` will still not be equal to `'0'`.
