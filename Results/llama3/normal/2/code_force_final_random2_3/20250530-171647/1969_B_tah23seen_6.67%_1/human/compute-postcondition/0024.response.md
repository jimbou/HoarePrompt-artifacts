To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `left` and `s[left]` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not '1'. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is '0', and `left` is increased by 1.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `left` to be less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` to be '0'. Since `left` is increased by 1, we need to make sure that `left` is still less than `len(s)` after the increment.

State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1', `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string, `right` is less than `len(s)` and points to a character that is '0' or `right` is equal to `len(s)`, and `left` is less than `len(s) - 1` and `s[left]` is '0' and `s[left + 1]` is '0'**
