The variables in the loop head are `left` and `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `s`. If `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not equal to `'1'`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, `s[left-1]` is equal to `'0'`. `left` being less than or equal to `len(s)` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `left` is less than `len(s)`. Also, `s[left-1]` being equal to `'0'` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `s[left]` is not equal to `'1'`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, `left` is less than `len(s)`, `s[left]` is not equal to `'1'`**
