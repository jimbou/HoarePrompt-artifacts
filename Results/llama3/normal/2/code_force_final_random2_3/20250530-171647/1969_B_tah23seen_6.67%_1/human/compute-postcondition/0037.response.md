To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved accordingly. The loop head is `while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':`.

1. **Condition 1: `left < len(s)`**
   - Right before the loop, `left` is less than `len(s)`, which already satisfies this condition. No adjustment is needed for `left` regarding this condition.

2. **Condition 2: `s[left] != '1'`**
   - Right before the loop, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, but there's no information about `s[left]`. For the loop to execute, `s[left]` must not be `'1'`. Since we cannot change the value of `s[right-1]` (as it's not part of the loop condition), we need to ensure `s[left]` is not `'1'`. However, we cannot directly adjust `s[left]` to a specific value, but we can infer that for the loop to proceed, `s[left]` must be different from `'1'`.

Given these considerations, the state adjustments focus on ensuring that `s[left]` is not `'1'`, as `left` being less than `len(s)` is already satisfied by the initial conditions.

State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, and `s[left]` must not be `'1'`**
