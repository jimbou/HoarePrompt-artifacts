Output State: **left is equal to len(s), right is equal to len(s), s[right-1] is not equal to '0', s[left-1] is not equal to '1'**.

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `left` and `right` pointers have reached the end of the string `s`, and the last character of the string is not '0' and the second last character of the string is not '1'.
