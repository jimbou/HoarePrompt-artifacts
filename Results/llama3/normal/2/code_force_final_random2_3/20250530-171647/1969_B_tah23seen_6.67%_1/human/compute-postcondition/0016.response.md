Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1', `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string, and `right` is less than or equal to `len(s) - 1` and points to a character that is not '0'**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, but it is still less than or equal to `len(s) - 1` because the length of `s` is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). The other variables remain unchanged.
