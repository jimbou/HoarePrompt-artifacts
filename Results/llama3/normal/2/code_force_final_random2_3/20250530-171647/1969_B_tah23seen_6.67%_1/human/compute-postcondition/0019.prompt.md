Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `left` is 1, `right` is 0, the character at the `right` index of `s` is '1', the character at the `left` index of `s` is '0', and `cost` is 2. Otherwise, the values of `left`, `right`, `s[right]`, `s[left]`, and `cost` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1', `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string, and `right` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1', `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string, and `right` is less than or equal to `len(s) - 1` and points to a character that is not '0'
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1', `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string, and `right` is less than `len(s)` and points to a character that is not '0', and `s[right + 1]` is not '0' and `right` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
