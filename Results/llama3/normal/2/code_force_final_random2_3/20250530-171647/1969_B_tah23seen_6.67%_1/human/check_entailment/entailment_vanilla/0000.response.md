Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program uses a two-pointer approach to iterate through the string, swapping '0's and '1's when necessary and incrementing the cost accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by converting the input string into a list of characters for easier manipulation.
2. It initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the first and second characters of the string, respectively.
3. The program then enters a while loop that continues until `right` reaches the end of the string or `left` reaches the end of the string.
4. Inside the loop, the program checks if the character at the `right` index is '0' and the character at the `left` index is '1'. If this condition is true, it swaps the characters at the `right` and `left` indices and increments the cost by the length of the substring from `left` to `right` (inclusive).
5. After swapping the characters, the program increments `right` until it finds a '0' or reaches the end of the string.
6. Similarly, the program increments `left` until it finds a '1' or reaches the end of the string.
7. The loop repeats steps 4-6 until the end of the string is reached.
8. Finally, the program returns the total cost accumulated during the iterations.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few minor issues with the code:

* The function name `func_1` is not descriptive and could be renamed to something more meaningful, such as `min_cost_to_sort`.
* The variable names `sChar` and `s` could be more descriptive, such as `input_string` and `char_list`, respectively.
* The loop condition `while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):` could be simplified to `while right < len(s):`, as the other conditions are implied by the loop's logic.

Correctness: **True**
