Output State: **sChar is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), s is a list containing all characters of sChar, i is the last character in the string, left is 0, cost is 0, right is 1**

The code snippet initializes three new variables: `left`, `cost`, and `right`. The first line assigns the value 0 to `left`. The second line assigns the value 0 to `cost`. The third line assigns the value 1 to `right`. These assignments do not affect the existing variables `sChar`, `s`, and `i`. Therefore, the final output state includes the initial state of `sChar`, `s`, and `i`, along with the newly assigned values of `left`, `cost`, and `right`.
