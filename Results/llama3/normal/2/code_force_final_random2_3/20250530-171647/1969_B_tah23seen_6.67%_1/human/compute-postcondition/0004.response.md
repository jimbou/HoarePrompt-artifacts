Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 3 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a list containing the first two characters of `sChar`, `i` is the second character in the string**

In this output state, the length and content of `sChar` remain unchanged. The list `s` now contains the first two characters of `sChar`, which are the first character (already present in `s`) and the second character `i` (appended to `s`). The value of `i` remains the same, which is the second character in the string `sChar`.
