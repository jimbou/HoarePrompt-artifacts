To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `right < len(s)` and `s[right] != '0'`.

1. **`right < len(s)`**: This condition must be true for the loop to continue. Since `right` is less than or equal to `len(s) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `right` is still less than `len(s)` for the next iteration. This implies that `right` should be less than `len(s) - 1` to guarantee that the loop can execute again.

2. **`s[right] != '0'`**: This condition must also be true for the loop to continue. Since `right` points to a character that is not '0' at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the character at the next position (`right + 1`) is also not '0'. This implies that `s[right + 1]` should not be '0'.

Considering these conditions, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `right` should be less than `len(s) - 1` to guarantee that the loop can execute again.
* `s[right + 1]` should not be '0' to ensure that the loop condition `s[right] != '0'` is still true for the next iteration.

The other states, such as `sChar`, `s`, and `i`, do not need to be adjusted since they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1', `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string, and `right` is less than `len(s) - 1` and points to a character that is not '0', and `s[right + 1]` is not '0'**
