Output State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1', `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string, and `right` is less than `len(s)` and points to a character that is not '0', and `s[right + 1]` is not '0' and `right` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `sChar` still consists of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is still between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is still '1'. The list `s` still contains all characters of `sChar`. The variable `i` still points to the last character in the string. The variable `right` is still less than the length of `s` but its value is increased by 1 and it still points to a character that is not '0', and the character next to it (`s[right + 1]`) is also not '0'.
