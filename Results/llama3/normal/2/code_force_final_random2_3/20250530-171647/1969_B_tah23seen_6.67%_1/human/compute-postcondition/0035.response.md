Output State: **`left` is less than `len(s)`, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to '0'**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, so it is now one position to the right of its original position. The value of `left` remains unchanged. The condition `s[right] is not equal to '0'` is no longer valid because `right` has moved one position to the right, but we know that `s[right-1]` is not equal to '0' because it was the value at the original `right` position. The condition `right` is less than `len(s)` is now `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)` because `right` could be equal to `len(s)` after the increment.
