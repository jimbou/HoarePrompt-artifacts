The variables in the loop head are left and s, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables left and s. If left is less than len(s) and s[left] is not '1', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, left is greater than 1 and less than len(s), and s[left] is not '1'. left being greater than 1 and less than len(s) does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to left is less than len(s). s[left] being not '1' does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to s[left] is '0'. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and its first character is '1', `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string, `right` is less than `len(s)` and points to a character that is '0' or `right` is equal to `len(s)`, and `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is '0'**
