Output State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, and `s[left]` must not be `'1'`**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to `len(s)`. The other conditions remain the same: `right` is still equal to `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, and `s[left]` must not be `'1'`.
