Postcondition: ***left is less than len(s), right is greater than or equal to left and right is less than len(s). If s[right] equals '0' and s[left] equals '1', then the characters at indices left and right have been swapped in s, and cost has been incremented by the value of right - left + 1. Otherwise, no changes have been made to s or cost.***
