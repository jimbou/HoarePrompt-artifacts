The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `right` was less than `len(s)`, so the new value of `right` is either less than or equal to `len(s)`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`right` is either less than or equal to `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)-1`, `s[left]` is equal to `'1'`**
