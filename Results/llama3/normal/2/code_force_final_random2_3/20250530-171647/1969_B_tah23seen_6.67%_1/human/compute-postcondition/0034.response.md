The variables in the loop head are `right` and `s[right]`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `right` and `s[right]`. If `right` is less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` is not equal to '0', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, and `s[right-1]` is not equal to '0'. `right` being less than or equal to `len(s)` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `right` is less than `len(s)`. Also, `s[right-1]` is not equal to '0' does not ensure that `s[right]` is not equal to '0', so it needs to be adjusted to `s[right]` is not equal to '0'. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`left` is less than `len(s)`, `right` is less than `len(s)`, `s[right]` is not equal to '0'**
