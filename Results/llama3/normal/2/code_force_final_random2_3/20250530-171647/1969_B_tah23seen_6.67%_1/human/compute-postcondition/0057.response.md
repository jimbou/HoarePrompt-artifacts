Output State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, `s[left-1]` is not equal to `'1'`**

In this output state, the value of `left` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to `len(s)`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Note that `s[left-1]` is not equal to `'1'` because `s[left]` was not equal to `'1'` initially, and `left` has been incremented by 1.
