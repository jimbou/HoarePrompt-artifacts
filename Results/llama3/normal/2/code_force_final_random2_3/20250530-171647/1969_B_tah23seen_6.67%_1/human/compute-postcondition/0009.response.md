To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the relevant variables accordingly. The loop head contains the conditions `left <= right`, `right < len(s)`, and `left < len(s)`.

Given the initial states:

- `sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive).
- `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`.
- `i` is the last character in the string.
- `left` is 0.
- `cost` is 0.
- `right` is 1.

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. `left <= right`: This condition is already satisfied since `left` is 0 and `right` is 1.

2. `right < len(s)`: Since `right` is 1, this condition requires that `len(s)` must be greater than 1. Given that `sChar`'s length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and `s` contains all characters of `sChar`, `len(s)` will indeed be greater than 1, satisfying this condition without needing any adjustments.

3. `left < len(s)`: Since `left` is 0, this condition is also satisfied because `len(s)` is at least 2, as per the given constraints.

Considering these points, all conditions for the loop to execute the first time are already met with the given states. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary.

State: **`sChar` is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`, `i` is the last character in the string, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1**
