According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `s[left]`. If `left` is less than `len(s)` and `s[left]` is not equal to `'1'`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)`, so it needs to be adjusted to `left` is less than `len(s)`. `s[left]` must not be `'1'`, so it needs to be adjusted to `s[left]` is not equal to `'1'`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`right` is equal to `len(s)`, `left` is less than `len(s)`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, and `s[left]` is not equal to `'1'`**
