According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `right` and `s[right]`. If `right` is less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` is not equal to `'0'`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is less than or equal to `len(s)-1`, `s[right-1]` is not equal to `'0'`, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)-1`, and `s[left]` is equal to `'1'`. `right` being less than or equal to `len(s)-1` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `right` is less than `len(s)`. `s[right-1]` being not equal to `'0'` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `s[right]` is not equal to `'0'`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`right` is less than `len(s)`, `s[right]` is not equal to `'0'`, `left` is less than or equal to `len(s)-1`, `s[left]` is equal to `'1'`**
