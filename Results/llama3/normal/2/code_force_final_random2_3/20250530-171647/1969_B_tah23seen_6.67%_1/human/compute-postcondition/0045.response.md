Output State: **right is equal to len(s)-1, left is less than or equal to len(s)-1, s[right-1] is equal to '1', s[left] is not equal to '0', cost is increased by right - left + 1**

In this final state, the values of `right` and `left` remain unchanged. The swapping operation in the first line of the code snippet exchanges the characters at indices `right` and `left` in the string `s`. As a result, `s[right-1]` becomes `'1'` and `s[left]` becomes not equal to `'0'`. The second line increments the `cost` variable by the value of `right - left + 1`, which is a positive integer. All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain valid and unchanged.
