Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers. If n equals 1, the value of k which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 is being printed. If n is larger than 1, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is a list of length n containing the values (1 << i+1) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) - 1 zeros, i is the largest integer such that 2^(i+1) is less than k, and temp is 2^(i+1), and the elements of ans are printed. The current value of temp is less than or equal to half of k.**

The code block modifies the values of `temp` and `i`. The first line doubles the value of `temp`, making it `2^(i+1)`. The second line increments `i` by 1, making it the largest integer such that `2^(i+1)` is less than `k`. The value of `ans` is updated to include the new value `(1 << (i+1)) - 1`, and the number of zeros at the end of `ans` is reduced by 1. The value of `k` remains unchanged. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unaffected.
