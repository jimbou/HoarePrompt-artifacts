Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is an empty list, i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is no longer less than k, and temp is the largest power of 2 less than k.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables not affected by the loop head and body (n, k, stdin, arr, k0, ans) remain unchanged. The variable i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is no longer less than k, and temp is the largest power of 2 less than k.
