Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each containing two integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t - 1 lines of input, each containing two integers. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the program will exit the current loop or conditional statement.
