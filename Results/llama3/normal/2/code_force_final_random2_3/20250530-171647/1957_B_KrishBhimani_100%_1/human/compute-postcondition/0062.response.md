Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is an empty list, temp is larger than or equal to k/2, i is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `temp` is doubled, making it larger than or equal to `k/2`, and the value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The stdin remains unchanged as no input operations are performed in the code snippet.
