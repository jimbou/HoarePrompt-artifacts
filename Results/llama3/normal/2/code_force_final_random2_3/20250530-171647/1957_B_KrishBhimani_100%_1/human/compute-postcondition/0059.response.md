Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each containing two integers, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `temp` is 1, and `temp` is larger than or equal to `k/2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The state of all variables remains the same as in the initial state, with the additional information that we have exited the innermost loop or if statement.
