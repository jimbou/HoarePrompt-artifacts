Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, i is 0, ans is an empty list, temp is 1.**

The code initializes several variables: `arr` is set to an empty list, `k0` is set to the value of `k`, `i` is set to 0, `ans` is set to an empty list, and `temp` is set to 1. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as no input is read or modified.
