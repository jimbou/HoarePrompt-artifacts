Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is a list of length n containing the values (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros, i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than k, and temp is 2^i.**

The code block modifies the `ans` list by appending three values: `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - sum(ans)`, and `n - len(ans)` zeros. The value of `i` is the largest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k`, and `temp` is equal to `2^i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
