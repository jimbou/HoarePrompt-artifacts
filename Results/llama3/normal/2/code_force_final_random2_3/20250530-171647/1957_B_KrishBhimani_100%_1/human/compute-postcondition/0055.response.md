Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is an empty list, i is 0, and temp is 1**
