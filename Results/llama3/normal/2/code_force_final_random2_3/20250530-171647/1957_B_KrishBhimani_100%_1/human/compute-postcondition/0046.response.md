Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers. If n equals 1, the value of k which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 is being printed. If n is larger than 1, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is a list of length n containing the values (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) - 1 zeros, i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to k, and temp is 2^i, and the elements of ans are printed.**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged, as does the value of `k`. The `stdin` still contains `t-1` lines of input, each with two integers. If `n` is 1, the value of `k` is printed. If `n` is larger than 1, the list `arr` remains empty, and `k0` remains equal to `k`. The list `ans` now contains one more element, `(1 << i) - 1`, and its length is increased by 1. The value of `i` remains the largest integer such that `2^i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `temp` remains `2^i`. The elements of `ans` are printed.
