Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is an empty list. If temp * 2 is less than k, then temp is larger than or equal to k/2 and i is 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables n, k, stdin, arr, k0, and ans remain unchanged. The condition "If temp * 2 is less than k, then temp is larger than or equal to k/2 and i is 2" is still valid, but since we break out of the loop, the value of i is not updated.
