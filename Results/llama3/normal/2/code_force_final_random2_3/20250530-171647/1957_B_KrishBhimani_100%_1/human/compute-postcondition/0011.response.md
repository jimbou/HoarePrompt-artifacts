Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to `k`, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1, and `temp * 2` is larger than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each with two integers. The lists `arr` and `ans` remain empty, and the values of `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, and `temp` are unchanged.
