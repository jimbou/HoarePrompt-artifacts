You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        
        n, k = list(map(int, l1))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin is empty, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is a list of length n containing the values (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros if n is larger than 1 and k is larger than 2^i, otherwise n - len(ans) - 1 zeros, i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to k, and temp is 2^i. If n is 1, k is printed. Otherwise, the largest power of 2 less than k minus 1, the remaining value after subtracting the sum of the first element and the zeros from k, and a list of zeros with a length of n minus the length of ans are printed.

```

Return Postconditions: n is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin is empty, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is a list of length n containing the values (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros if n is larger than 1 and k is larger than 2^i, otherwise n - len(ans) - 1 zeros, i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to k, and temp is 2^i. If n is 1, k is printed. Otherwise, the largest power of 2 less than k minus 1, the remaining value after subtracting the sum of the first element and the zeros from k, and a list of zeros with a length of n minus the length of ans are printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
