Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and if temp * 2 is less than k, then i is 1 and temp is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each with two integers. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, if the condition temp * 2 is less than k is true, then the value of i is 1 and temp is 2.
