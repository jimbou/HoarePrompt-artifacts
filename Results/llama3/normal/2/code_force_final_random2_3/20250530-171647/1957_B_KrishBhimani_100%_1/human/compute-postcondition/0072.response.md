The code prints the elements of the list `ans` which contains three elements: `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - sum(ans)`, and `n - len(ans)` zeros.
Since `i` is the number of times `temp` can be doubled before it is no longer less than `k`, and `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, we can infer that `(1 << i) - 1` is the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1.
The second element of `ans` is `k - sum(ans)`, which means it is the remaining value after subtracting the sum of the first element and the zeros from `k`.
The third element of `ans` is `n - len(ans)` zeros, which means it is a list of zeros with a length of `n` minus the length of `ans`.
Output: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is a list containing three elements: (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros, i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is no longer less than k, and temp is the largest power of 2 less than k, and this is printed: the largest power of 2 less than k minus 1, the remaining value after subtracting the sum of the first element and the zeros from k, and a list of zeros with a length of n minus the length of ans**
