Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is an empty list. If temp * 2 is less than k, then i is 1 and temp is 2. Otherwise, if temp * 2 is larger than or equal to k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
