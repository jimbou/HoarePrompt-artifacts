Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is an empty list, i is 0, and temp is 1.**

The provided code snippet initializes several variables, but does not modify the existing state of `n`, `k`, `stdin`, `k0`, or `ans`. The variable `arr` is reassigned to an empty list, `i` is set to 0, and `temp` is set to 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `stdin`, `k0`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
