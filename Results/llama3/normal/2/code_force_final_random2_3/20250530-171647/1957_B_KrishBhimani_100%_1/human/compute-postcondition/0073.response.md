Postcondition: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is a list of length n containing the values (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros if n is larger than 1 and k is larger than 2^i, otherwise n - len(ans) - 1 zeros, i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to k, and temp is 2^i. If n is 1, k is printed. Otherwise, the largest power of 2 less than k minus 1, the remaining value after subtracting the sum of the first element and the zeros from k, and a list of zeros with a length of n minus the length of ans are printed.**
