The only object in the loop head is variable `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin.  If the stdin has at least t lines the loop executes again for the t-th time. At the end of the last iteration, stdin has t-1 lines of input. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must have at least t lines.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t lines of input, each containing two integers. If n equals 1, the value of k which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 is being printed. If n is larger than 1, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is a list of length n containing the values (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros, i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than k, and temp is 2^i, and the elements of ans are printed.**
