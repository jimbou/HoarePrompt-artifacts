The code reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into a list of strings using space as the delimiter, and assigns it to `l1`. Then, it converts the first two elements of `l1` to integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers.**
