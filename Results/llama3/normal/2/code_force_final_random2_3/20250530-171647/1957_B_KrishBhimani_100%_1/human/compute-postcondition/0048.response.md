Output: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers. If n equals 1, the value of k which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 is being printed. If n is larger than 1, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is a list of length n containing the values (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) - 1 zeros, i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to k, and temp is 2^i, and the elements of ans are printed.**
