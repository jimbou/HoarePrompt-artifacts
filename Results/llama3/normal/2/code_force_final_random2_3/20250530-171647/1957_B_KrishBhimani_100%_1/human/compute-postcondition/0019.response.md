Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions related to `temp` and `i` are no longer applicable as we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
