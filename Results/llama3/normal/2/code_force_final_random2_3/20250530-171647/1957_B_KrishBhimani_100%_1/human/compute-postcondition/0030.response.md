Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers. If n equals 1, the value of k which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 is being printed. If n is larger than 1, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is a list of length n containing the values (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros, i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than k, and temp is 2^i, and the elements of ans are printed.**

The code initializes several variables: `arr` as an empty list, `k0` as a copy of `k`, `ans` as an empty list, `i` as 0, and `temp` as 1. These assignments do not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or the contents of `stdin`. The initial state remains valid for these variables. The code does not modify `n`, `k`, or `stdin`, so their states remain unchanged. The only changes are the introduction of new variables with their respective initial values.
