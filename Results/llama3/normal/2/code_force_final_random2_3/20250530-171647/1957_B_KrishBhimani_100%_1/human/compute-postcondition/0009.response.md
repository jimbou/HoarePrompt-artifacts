The first line multiplies the current value of `temp` by 2, making it 2. The second line increments the value of `i` by 1, making it 1. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, i is 1, ans is an empty list, and temp is 2.**
