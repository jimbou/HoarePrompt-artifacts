Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin is empty, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is a list of length n containing the values (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros if n is larger than 1 and k is larger than 2^i, otherwise n - len(ans) - 1 zeros, i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to k, and temp is 2^i. If n is 1, k is printed. Otherwise, the largest power of 2 less than k minus 1, the remaining value after subtracting the sum of the first element and the zeros from k, and a list of zeros with a length of n minus the length of ans are printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input has been fully processed, and the output has been printed. The values of n and k are still within their respective ranges, but stdin is now empty since all input has been consumed. The variables arr, k0, ans, i, and temp still hold their respective values, but their values are no longer being updated since the loop has finished executing. The output has been printed according to the conditions specified in the loop body.
