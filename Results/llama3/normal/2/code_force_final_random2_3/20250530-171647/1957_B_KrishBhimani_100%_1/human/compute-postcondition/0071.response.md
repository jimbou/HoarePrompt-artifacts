The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. The list `ans` contains three elements: `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - sum(ans)`, and `n - len(ans)` zeros.

Here's a breakdown of each element:

1. `(1 << i) - 1`: This is the largest power of 2 less than `k`. The value of `i` is the number of times `temp` can be doubled before it is no longer less than `k`. Since `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, `(1 << i) - 1` represents this largest power of 2.

2. `k - sum(ans)`: This is the difference between `k` and the sum of the elements in the list `ans`. Since `ans` contains `(1 << i) - 1` and `n - len(ans)` zeros, the sum of `ans` is `(1 << i) - 1` plus the sum of the zeros, which is 0. Therefore, `k - sum(ans)` is equal to `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`.

3. `n - len(ans)` zeros: These are the remaining elements in the list `ans`, which are all zeros. The number of zeros is `n - len(ans)`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^5.

Output: **(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1), and n - len(ans) zeros (where i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is no longer less than k, and n is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^5)**
