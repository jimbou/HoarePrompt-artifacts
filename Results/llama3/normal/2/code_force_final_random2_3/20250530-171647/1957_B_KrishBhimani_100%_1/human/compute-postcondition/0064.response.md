Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is an empty list. If temp * 2 is less than k, then temp is larger than or equal to k/2 and i is 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
