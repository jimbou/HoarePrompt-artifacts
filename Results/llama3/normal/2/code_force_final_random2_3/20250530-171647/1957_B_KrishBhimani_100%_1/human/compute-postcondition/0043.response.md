Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers. If `n` equals 1, the value of `k` which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 is being printed. If `n` is larger than 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to `k`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values (1 << `i`) - 1, `k` - sum(`ans`), and `n` - len(`ans`) zeros, `i` is the largest integer such that 2^`i` is less than `k`, and `temp` is 2^`i`, and the elements of `ans` are printed. If `temp` * 2 is less than `k`, then the list `ans` contains the values (1 << `i+1`) - 1, `k` - sum(`ans`), and `n` - len(`ans`) - 1 zeros, `i` is the largest integer such that 2^(`i+1`) is less than `k`, and `temp` is 2^(`i+1`), and the elements of `ans` are printed. Otherwise, the elements of `ans` are printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and now we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `i`, and `temp` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
