Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers. If n equals 1, the value of k which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 is being printed. If n is larger than 1, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is a list of length n containing the values (1 << i+1) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) - 1 zeros, i is the largest integer such that 2^(i+1) is less than k, and temp is 2^(i+1), and the elements of ans are printed.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been doubled, and the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The list `ans` now contains the values `(1 << i+1) - 1`, `k - sum(ans)`, and `n - len(ans) - 1` zeros. The elements of `ans` are printed. The values of `n`, `k`, `stdin`, `arr`, and `k0` remain unchanged.
