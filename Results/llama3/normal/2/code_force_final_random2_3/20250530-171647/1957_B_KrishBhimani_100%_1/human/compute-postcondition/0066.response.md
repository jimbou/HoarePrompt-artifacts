Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is an empty list, temp is larger than or equal to k/2 and less than k, i is 3.**

The code multiplies `temp` by 2 and increments `i` by 1. Since `temp * 2` is less than `k`, `temp` is larger than or equal to `k/2` and `i` is 2 before the code executes. After the code executes, `temp` is still larger than or equal to `k/2` but less than `k`, and `i` becomes 3. No other variables are affected.
