The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input has at least t lines the loop executes again for the t-th time. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must contain t lines of input, each containing two integers.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is a list of length n containing the values (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros if n is larger than 1 and k is larger than 2^i, otherwise n - len(ans) - 1 zeros, i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to k, and temp is 2^i**
