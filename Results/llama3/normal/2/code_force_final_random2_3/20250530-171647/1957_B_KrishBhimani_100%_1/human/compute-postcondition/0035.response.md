Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers. If `n` equals 1, the value of `k` which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 is being printed. If `n` is larger than 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to `k`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values (1 << `i`) - 1, `k` - sum(`ans`), and `n` - len(`ans`) zeros, `i` is the largest integer such that 2^`i` is less than `k`, and `temp` is 2^`i`, and the elements of `ans` are printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `temp` * 2 is larger than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers. If n equals 1, the value of k is being printed, and if n is larger than 1, the elements of ans are printed.
