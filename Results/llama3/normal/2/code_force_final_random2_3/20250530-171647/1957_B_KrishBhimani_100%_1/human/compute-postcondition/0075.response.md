Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It reads multiple lines of input, where the first line contains a single integer t, and each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k. For each pair of n and k, if n is 1, it prints k. Otherwise, it calculates the largest power of 2 less than k, subtracts 1 from it, and prints this value along with the remaining value after subtracting the sum of this value and n-2 zeros from k, and a list of zeros with a length of n-2. The function continues this process until it has processed all input lines, at which point stdin is empty.**
