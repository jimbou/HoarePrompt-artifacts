Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is an empty list, temp is 4, i is 2.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `temp` and `i`. Initially, `temp` is 2 and `i` is 1. The first line multiplies `temp` by 2, making it 4. The second line increments `i` by 1, making it 2. No other variables are affected by the code. The values of `n`, `k`, `stdin`, `arr`, `k0`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
