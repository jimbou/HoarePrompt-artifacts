Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is an empty list. i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than k, and temp is 2^i.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables not affected by the loop (n, k, stdin, arr, k0, ans) remain unchanged. The variable i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than k, and the variable temp is 2^i. This means that the loop continues to double the value of temp and increment i until temp * 2 is no longer less than k, at which point the loop breaks.
