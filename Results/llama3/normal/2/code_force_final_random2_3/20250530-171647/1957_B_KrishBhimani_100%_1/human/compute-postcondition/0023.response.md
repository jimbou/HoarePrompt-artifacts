The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list.

Based on the initial state, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - sum(ans)`, and `n - len(ans)` zeros.

Here's a breakdown of the values in the `ans` list:

* `(1 << i) - 1`: This is a value calculated using the bitwise left shift operator (`<<`). It shifts the binary representation of `1` to the left by `i` places, effectively multiplying it by `2^i`. Then, it subtracts `1` from the result. Since `i` is the largest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k`, this value will be the largest power of `2` less than `k`, minus `1`.
* `k - sum(ans)`: This is the difference between the value of `k` and the sum of all elements in the `ans` list. Since `ans` contains the values `(1 << i) - 1` and `n - len(ans)` zeros, the sum of `ans` will be the sum of these values. Subtracting this sum from `k` will give the remaining value.
* `n - len(ans)` zeros: These are the remaining elements in the `ans` list, which are all zeros.

When the `print(*ans)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the `ans` list, separated by spaces. The output will be a sequence of values, starting with the largest power of `2` less than `k`, minus `1`, followed by the remaining value `k - sum(ans)`, and then the `n - len(ans)` zeros.

Output: **(1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), 0, 0, ..., 0 (where i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than k, and the zeros are repeated n - len(ans) times)**
