Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is an empty list, i is 1, and the current value of temp is less than k.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `temp` has been doubled. The value of `temp` is now less than `k`, but still greater than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
