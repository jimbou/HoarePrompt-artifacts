Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5, k is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each containing two integers, arr is an empty list, k0 is an integer between 1 and 10^9 equal to k, ans is a list containing three elements: (1 << i) - 1, k - sum(ans), and n - len(ans) zeros, i is the number of times temp can be doubled before it is no longer less than k, and temp is the largest power of 2 less than k.**

Here's a description of the final state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5. The value of `k` also remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^9. The contents of `stdin` are unaffected, still containing `t - 1` lines of input, each with two integers. The `arr` list remains empty. The value of `k0` remains equal to `k`, still an integer between 1 and 10^9. The `ans` list now contains three elements: the first element is `(1 << i) - 1`, the second element is `k - sum(ans)`, and the remaining `n - len(ans)` elements are zeros. The value of `i` remains unchanged, still the number of times `temp` can be doubled before it is no longer less than `k`. The value of `temp` also remains unchanged, still the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
