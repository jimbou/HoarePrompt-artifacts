Postcondition: ***mexsize is equal to maxsize + 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, stdin contains no inputs, tc is 2, t is greater than 2, and sz is the last element in a. If mexsize is greater than maxsize, 'Alice' is printed if mexsize is even, otherwise 'Bob' is printed. If mexsize is less than or equal to maxsize, 'Alice' is printed if mexsize is odd, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.***
