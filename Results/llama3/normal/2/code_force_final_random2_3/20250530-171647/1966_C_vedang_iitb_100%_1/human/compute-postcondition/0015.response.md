The code prints 'Alice' if the smallest integer that is not in the list `a` is even, otherwise it prints 'Bob'. Since the current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, we can't determine the exact parity of `mexsize`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'Alice' or 'Bob' depending on whether `mexsize` is even or odd.
Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is even, 'Bob' if mexsize is odd**
