The value of `mexsize` is incremented by 1. The value of `mexsize` can be 1 or 2, so the value of `mexsize` is 2 or 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `mexsize` is either 2 or 3; `n` is an integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`; `stdin` contains no inputs; `tc` is 2; `t` is greater than 2; and `sz` is the second element in `a`.
