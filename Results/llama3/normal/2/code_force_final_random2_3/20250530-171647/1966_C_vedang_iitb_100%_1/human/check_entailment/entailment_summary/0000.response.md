Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for determining the winner of the game based on the size of the piles. The program first sorts the list of pile sizes and then finds the maximum size. It then calculates the minimum excluded size (mexsize) by iterating through the sorted list and finding the smallest size that is not present in the list. If mexsize is greater than the maximum size, it means that Alice can win by choosing a size that is not present in the list, and the program prints 'Alice' if mexsize is even and 'Bob' if mexsize is odd. If mexsize is less than or equal to the maximum size, it means that Alice cannot win by choosing a size that is not present in the list, and the program prints 'Alice' if mexsize is odd and 'Bob' if mexsize is even.

Correctness: **True**
