Output State: **mexsize is equal to maxsize + 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, stdin contains no inputs, tc is equal to t, and sz is the last element in a. If mexsize is greater than maxsize, 'Alice' is printed if mexsize is even, otherwise 'Bob' is printed. If mexsize is less than or equal to maxsize, 'Alice' is printed if mexsize is odd, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be such that `mexsize` will be one more than the maximum value in the list `a`, `n` will be an integer, `a` will be a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` will be the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` will contain no inputs, `tc` will be equal to `t`, and `sz` will be the last element in `a`. The output will be either 'Alice' or 'Bob' depending on whether `mexsize` is even or odd, and whether `mexsize` is greater than or less than or equal to `maxsize`.
