Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, if the first element `sz` in the list is equal to `mexsize` (which is 1), then `mexsize` is updated to 2 and `sz` is equal to `mexsize` (which is 2). Otherwise, no changes are made.***
