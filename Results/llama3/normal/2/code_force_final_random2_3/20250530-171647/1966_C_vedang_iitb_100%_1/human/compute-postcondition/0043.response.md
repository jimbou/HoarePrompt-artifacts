To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `sz` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, we can assume that the first element in `a` will be assigned to `sz` at the start of the loop.

State: **`mexsize` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs, `tc` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `sz` is the first element in `a`**
