Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: mexsize is 1, sz is the last element in the sorted list a, tc is 1, t is greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, stdin contains no inputs
Code of the loop:
for sz in a:
    if sz == mexsize:
        mexsize = mexsize + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`mexsize` is either 1 or 2, `sz` is the first element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 2 and `sz` is not equal to `mexsize`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`mexsize` is either 2 or 3, `sz` is the second element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs. If `sz` was equal to `mexsize` before the if statement, then `mexsize` is updated to 2 and `sz` is not equal to `mexsize` after the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`mexsize` is either 2, 3 or 4, `sz` is the third element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs. If `sz` was equal to `mexsize` before the if statement, then `mexsize` is updated to 2 and `sz` is not equal to `mexsize` after the if statement. Otherwise, `mexsize` is either 2 or 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
