Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers in ascending order, maxsize is the maximum value in a, mexsize is 1, tc is 0**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input because two lines have been consumed by the `input()` function calls. The variable `n` now holds the value of the first integer input, and the list `a` contains the `n` integers from the second input line, sorted in ascending order. The variable `maxsize` holds the maximum value among the integers in `a`. The variable `mexsize` is initialized to 1, and `tc` remains 0 as it is not modified by the code.
