Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a` (potentially updated if the next `sz` is larger), and `sz` is the next element in `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
