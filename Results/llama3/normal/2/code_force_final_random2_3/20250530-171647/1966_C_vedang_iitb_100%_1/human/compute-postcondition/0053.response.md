Output State: **mexsize is equal to maxsize + 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, stdin contains no inputs, tc is 2, t is greater than 2, and sz is the last element in a**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable mexsize will be equal to maxsize + 1, which means it will be one more than the maximum value in the list a. The other variables remain unchanged, with n being an integer, a being a sorted list of integers, maxsize being the maximum value in a, stdin containing no inputs, tc being 2, and t being greater than 2. The variable sz will be the last element in the list a.
