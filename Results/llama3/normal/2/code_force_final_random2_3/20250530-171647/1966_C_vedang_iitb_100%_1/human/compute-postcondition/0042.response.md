Output State: **mexsize is 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, stdin contains no inputs, tc is 2, t is greater than 2, sz is not defined**

The code snippet first assigns an integer value from stdin to `n`, but since stdin contains no inputs, this line does not affect the state of `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`, but since stdin contains no inputs, this line does not affect the state of `a`. The third line assigns the maximum value in `a` to `maxsize`, but since `a` is not modified, `maxsize` remains the maximum value in `a`. The fourth line sorts `a` in ascending order, but since `a` is already sorted, this line does not affect the state of `a`. The fifth line assigns 1 to `mexsize`, overwriting its previous value.

Note that the variables `sz`, `tc`, and `t` are not modified by the code snippet, so their values remain the same as in the initial state. However, since `sz` is not defined in the initial state, it is not included in the output state.
