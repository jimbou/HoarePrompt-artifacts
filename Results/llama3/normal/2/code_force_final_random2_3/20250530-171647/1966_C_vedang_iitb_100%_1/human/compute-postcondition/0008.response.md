Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a` (potentially updated if the next `sz` is larger), `sz` is the next element in `a`, and `mexsize` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The input `stdin` still contains `t-1` lines of input, and the list `a` remains a sorted list of `n` integers with at least 2 elements. The maximum value in `a` is still potentially updated if the next `sz` is larger, and `sz` is still the next element in `a`.
