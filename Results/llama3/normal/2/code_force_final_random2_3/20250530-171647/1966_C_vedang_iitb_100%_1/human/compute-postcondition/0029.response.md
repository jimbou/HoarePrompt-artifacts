Postcondition: ***`mexsize` is either 2 or 3, `sz` is the second element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs. If `sz` was equal to `mexsize` before the if statement, then `mexsize` is updated to 2 and `sz` is not equal to `mexsize` after the if statement.***
