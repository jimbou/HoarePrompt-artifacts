The code prints 'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, otherwise it prints 'Bob'. Since `mexsize` is either 2 or `maxsize` + 1, and `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, we can conclude that `mexsize` is either 2 (even) or `maxsize` + 1 (odd).

Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is odd (i.e., mexsize is maxsize + 1), otherwise 'Bob' (i.e., mexsize is 2)**
