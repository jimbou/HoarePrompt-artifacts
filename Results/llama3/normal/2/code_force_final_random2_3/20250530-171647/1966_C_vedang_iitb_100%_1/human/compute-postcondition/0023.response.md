To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `sz` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute.

At the start of the loop, `sz` is the last element in the sorted list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least 1 element, and `sz` will take on the value of the first element in the list.

State: **`mexsize` is 1, `sz` is the first element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs**
