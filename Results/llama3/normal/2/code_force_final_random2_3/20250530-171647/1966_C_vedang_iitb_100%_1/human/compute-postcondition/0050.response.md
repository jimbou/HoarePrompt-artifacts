To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for sz in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `sz` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `a` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, and `sz` is the second element in `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `sz` must be the third element in `a`.

State: **`mexsize` is either 2 or 3; `n` is an integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements; `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`; `stdin` contains no inputs; `tc` is 2; `t` is greater than 2; and `sz` is the third element in `a`.**
