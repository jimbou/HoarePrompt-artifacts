The only variable in the loop head is variable sz and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, sz is the second element in the list a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the sz is the third element in the list.
State: **`mexsize` is either 2 or 3, `sz` is the third element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs. If `sz` was equal to `mexsize` before the if statement, then `mexsize` is updated to 2 and `sz` is not equal to `mexsize` after the if statement.**
