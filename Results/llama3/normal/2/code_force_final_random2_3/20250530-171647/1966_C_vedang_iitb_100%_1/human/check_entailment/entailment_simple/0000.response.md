Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem can be solved by finding the minimum excluded value (mex) of the pile sizes. The mex is the smallest positive integer that is not present in the pile sizes. If the mex is greater than the maximum pile size, the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is Alice if the mex is even and Bob if the mex is odd. If the mex is less than or equal to the maximum pile size, the game is won by the player who can make the first move, which is Alice if the mex is odd and Bob if the mex is even.

The program correctly calculates the mex by sorting the pile sizes and iterating through them to find the smallest positive integer that is not present. It then prints the winner based on the mex and the maximum pile size.

Correctness: **True**
