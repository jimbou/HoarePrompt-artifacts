Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the way it calculates the `mexsize` variable. The `mexsize` is supposed to be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array `a`. However, the program increments `mexsize` only when it finds a value in `a` that is equal to the current `mexsize`. This means that if there are gaps in the values in `a`, the program will not correctly calculate the `mexsize`.

For example, if the input is `[1, 3, 4, 5]`, the program will calculate `mexsize` as 2, because it will increment `mexsize` only when it finds the value 1 in `a`. However, the correct `mexsize` should be 2, because 2 is the smallest positive integer that is not present in `a`.

This incorrect calculation of `mexsize` will lead to incorrect results in the game. For instance, in the example mentioned above, the program will print "Alice" as the winner, but the correct winner should be "Bob".
