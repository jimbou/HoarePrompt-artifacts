Postcondition: ***`mexsize` is either 3 or 4 if `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, otherwise `mexsize` remains either 2 or 3; `n` is an integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements; `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`; `stdin` contains no inputs; `tc` is 2; `t` is greater than 2; and `sz` is the third element in `a`.***
