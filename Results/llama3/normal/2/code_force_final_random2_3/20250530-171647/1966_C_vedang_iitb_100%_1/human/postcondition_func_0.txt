This function determines the winner of a game based on the size of a list of integers. It reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. For each test case, it sorts the list, finds the maximum size, and calculates the minimum excluded size (mexsize). If mexsize is greater than the maximum size, it prints 'Alice' if mexsize is even and 'Bob' if mexsize is odd. If mexsize is less than or equal to the maximum size, it prints 'Alice' if mexsize is odd and 'Bob' if mexsize is even. The function processes all test cases and prints the winner for each case.
