To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's analyze the given precondition and the Python code snippet.

The precondition states that `mexsize` is either 2 or `maxsize` + 1, and the current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`. This implies that `mexsize` cannot be 2 because it is greater than `maxsize`, so `mexsize` must be `maxsize` + 1.

The code snippet contains a conditional expression that checks whether `mexsize` is even or odd. If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Alice'; otherwise, it prints 'Bob'.

Since `mexsize` is `maxsize` + 1, and `maxsize` is an integer (as it is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`), `mexsize` will always be odd. This is because adding 1 to any integer results in an odd number.

Therefore, the conditional expression `mexsize % 2 == 0` will always be False, and the code will print 'Bob'.

Output: **Bob**
