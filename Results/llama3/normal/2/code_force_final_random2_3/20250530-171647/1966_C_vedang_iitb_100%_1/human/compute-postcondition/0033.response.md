Output State: **`mexsize` is either 2 or `maxsize` + 1, `sz` is the last element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the value of `mexsize` will be either 2 or `maxsize` + 1, depending on whether the last element in the sorted list `a` is equal to `mexsize` or not. The value of `sz` will be the last element in the sorted list `a`. The values of `tc`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
