According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `mexsize` is 1, `tc` is 0, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `n` is the length of `a`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input. So for the loop to be executed the list `a` must have at least 1 element and `sz` is the first element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `mexsize` is 1, `tc` is 0, `sz` is the first element in the list**
