Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers in ascending order, maxsize is the maximum value in a, mexsize is 1, tc is 0
Code of the loop:
for sz in a:
    if sz == mexsize:
        mexsize = mexsize + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, if the first element `sz` in the list is equal to `mexsize` (which is 1), then `mexsize` is updated to 2 and `sz` is equal to `mexsize` (which is 2). Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a` (potentially updated if the next `sz` is larger), and `sz` is the next element in `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `sz` is the next element in `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
