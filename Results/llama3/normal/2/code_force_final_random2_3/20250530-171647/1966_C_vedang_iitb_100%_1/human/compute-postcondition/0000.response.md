The code `t = int(input())` reads the first line of input from stdin, which contains an integer t, and assigns it to the variable t. The value of t is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The remaining lines of input in stdin are still present, containing t lines with an integer n, followed by a line with n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input, where each line contains an integer n, followed by a line with n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.**
