Postcondition: ***`mexsize` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs, `tc` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, and the first element in `a`, `sz`, is equal to 1 if `mexsize` is 2, otherwise `sz` is the first element in `a`***
