The only variable in the loop head is variable  sz, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, `sz` is the first element in the sorted list `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `sz` is the second element in the list.
State: **`mexsize` is either 1 or 2, `sz` is the second element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 2 and `sz` is not equal to `mexsize`.**
