Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input, where each line contains an integer n, followed by a line with n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxsize = max(a)
    a.sort()
    mexsize = 1
    for sz in a:
        if sz == mexsize:
            mexsize = mexsize + 1
    if mexsize > maxsize:
        print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`mexsize` is the smallest integer that is not in the list `a`, and `sz` is the last element in `a`. Either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether `mexsize` is odd or even

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`mexsize` is either 2 or `maxsize` + 1, `sz` is the last element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, 'Bob' is printed because `mexsize` is odd. If `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether `mexsize` is odd or even.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *mexsize is equal to maxsize + 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, maxsize is the maximum value in a, stdin contains no inputs, tc is 2, t is greater than 2, and sz is the last element in a. If mexsize is greater than maxsize, 'Alice' is printed if mexsize is even, otherwise 'Bob' is printed. If mexsize is less than or equal to maxsize, 'Alice' is printed if mexsize is odd, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
