Output State: **`mexsize` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs, `tc` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, and the first element in `a`, `sz`, is equal to 1.**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still sorted and has at least one element, and its maximum value is still stored in `maxsize`. The input stream `stdin` is still empty. The values of `tc` and `t` are also unchanged, with `tc` being 2 and `t` being greater than 2. The first element in `a`, `sz`, is still equal to 1, which is the initial value of `mexsize` before the increment.
