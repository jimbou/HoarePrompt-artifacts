State: **`mexsize` is either 2 or `maxsize` + 1, `sz` is the last element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, 'Bob' is printed because `mexsize` is odd. If `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether `mexsize` is odd or even.**
