The code prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on whether `mexsize` is odd or even. Since `mexsize` is the smallest integer that is not in the list `a` and is less than or equal to `maxsize`, its value depends on the elements in the list `a`. However, the exact value of `mexsize` is not provided, so we can't determine whether it's odd or even.

Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is odd, 'Bob' if mexsize is even**
