To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's analyze the given precondition and the Python code snippet.

The precondition states that `mexsize` is equal to `maxsize + 1`, and the current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`. This implies that `mexsize` is an odd number because it is one more than `maxsize`.

The code snippet contains a conditional expression that checks whether `mexsize` is even or odd using the modulus operator (`%`). If `mexsize` is even, it prints `'Alice'`; otherwise, it prints `'Bob'`.

Since `mexsize` is odd (as deduced from the precondition), the condition `mexsize % 2 == 0` will be `False`. Therefore, the code will print `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
