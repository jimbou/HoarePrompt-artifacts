Output State: **`mexsize` is either 2 or 3, `sz` is the second element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `sz` and `mexsize` is no longer relevant, as `mexsize` has been updated. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
