Output: **`mexsize` is either 2 or `maxsize` + 1, `sz` is the last element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs. The current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, and 'Bob' is printed because `mexsize` is odd (since `mexsize` is either 2 or `maxsize` + 1 and `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`)**
