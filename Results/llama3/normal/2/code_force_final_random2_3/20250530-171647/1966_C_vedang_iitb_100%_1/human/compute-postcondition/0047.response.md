To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for sz in a:`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `sz` is the first element in `a` if `mexsize` is 2, otherwise `sz` is the first element in `a`.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least one more element, and `sz` must be the next element in the list.

State: **`mexsize` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs, `tc` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, and `sz` is the second element in `a`**
