To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the variables involved.

The loop head is `for sz in a:`, where `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order with at least 1 element, and `sz` is the current element being iterated over.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), but this is not directly affected by the loop.
- `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, which is also not directly affected by this loop.
- `n` is an integer, representing the size of list `a`, but its value doesn't change with each iteration.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order with at least 1 element. Since we're iterating over `a`, for the loop to execute again, there must be another element in `a` that hasn't been processed yet.
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, but its value doesn't change simply because we move to the next iteration unless `sz` is the maximum value, which isn't specified.
- The condition regarding `mexsize` and updating `sz` to `mexsize` (which is 2) if the first element `sz` equals `mexsize` (which is 1) is specific to the loop body's logic and doesn't directly influence the loop's ability to proceed to the next iteration based on the loop head alone.

Given this, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, based on the loop head, is the position in the list `a` that `sz` points to. Since `sz` must move to the next element in `a` for the loop to continue, and knowing that `a` must have at least one more element for this to happen, we adjust the state as follows:

- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
- `stdin` still contains `t-1` lines of input.
- `n` remains an integer, representing the size of list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements now because we've moved past the first element.
- `maxsize` could potentially change if the next `sz` is larger than the current `maxsize`, but without specific values, we can't definitively say it changes.
- The condition regarding `mexsize` and `sz` doesn't directly affect the loop's continuation based on the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a` (potentially updated if the next `sz` is larger), and `sz` is the next element in `a`.**
