Output State: **`mexsize` is 2, `sz` is the first element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs. The current value of `sz` is not equal to the current value of `mexsize`**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged, so `sz` is still the first element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is still 1, `t` is still greater than 1, `n` is still an integer, `a` is still a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, and `maxsize` is still the maximum value in `a`. The stdin still contains no inputs. However, the current value of `sz` is no longer equal to the current value of `mexsize` because `mexsize` has been incremented.
