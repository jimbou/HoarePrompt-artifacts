To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `sz` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, and `sz` is the next element in `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `sz` must be the next element in `a`.

Additionally, since `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, it may need to be updated if the next `sz` is larger.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a` (potentially updated if the next `sz` is larger), and `sz` is the next element in `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
