Output State: **`mexsize` is the smallest integer that is not in the list `a`, and `sz` is the last element in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `mexsize` will be the smallest integer that is not present in the list `a`, and `sz` will be the last element in the list `a`. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `a`, and if the current element `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, it increments `mexsize` by 1. This process continues until all elements in `a` have been processed, at which point `mexsize` will be the smallest integer not in `a`, and `sz` will be the last element in `a`.
