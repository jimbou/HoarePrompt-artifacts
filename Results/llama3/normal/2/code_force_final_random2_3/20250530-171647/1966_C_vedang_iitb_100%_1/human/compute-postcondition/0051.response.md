Output State: **`mexsize` is either 3 or 4; `n` is an integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements; `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`; `stdin` contains no inputs; `tc` is 2; `t` is greater than 2; and `sz` is the third element in `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 3 or 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
