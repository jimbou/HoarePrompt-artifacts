To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's analyze the given precondition and the Python code snippet.

The precondition states that `mexsize` is equal to `maxsize + 1`, and `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`. However, this seems contradictory, as `mexsize` cannot be both equal to `maxsize + 1` and less than or equal to `maxsize` unless `maxsize` is a special value that allows this condition to be true (e.g., in some contexts, `maxsize` might be a maximum value that can be represented, and `mexsize` being one more could wrap around or have a specific meaning). For the purpose of this analysis, we'll consider the condition as given, but note this potential inconsistency.

The code snippet is a conditional print statement:

```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
```

This statement checks whether `mexsize` is odd (`mexsize % 2 == 1`) and prints `'Alice'` if it is, otherwise it prints `'Bob'`.

Given the precondition, we need to determine the parity (even or odd) of `mexsize`. Since `mexsize` is equal to `maxsize + 1`, the parity of `mexsize` depends on the parity of `maxsize`. If `maxsize` is even, then `maxsize + 1` is odd. If `maxsize` is odd, then `maxsize + 1` is even.

However, without explicit information on whether `maxsize` is even or odd, we cannot definitively determine the parity of `mexsize`. The precondition does not specify the parity of `maxsize`, nor does it provide a specific value for `maxsize` that we could use to infer the parity of `mexsize`.

Therefore, based on the given precondition, we can only describe the output in terms of the condition being evaluated:

Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is odd, 'Bob' if mexsize is even**

This description reflects the conditional nature of the print statement, without being able to provide a definitive 'Alice' or 'Bob' due to the lack of specific information about `maxsize`'s parity.
