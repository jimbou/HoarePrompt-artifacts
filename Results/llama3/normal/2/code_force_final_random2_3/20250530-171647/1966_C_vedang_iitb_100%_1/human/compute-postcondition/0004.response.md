Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `mexsize` is 1, `tc` is 0, and the current value of `sz` is equal to `mexsize` (which is 1), indicating that the first element in the list `a` is equal to 1.**
