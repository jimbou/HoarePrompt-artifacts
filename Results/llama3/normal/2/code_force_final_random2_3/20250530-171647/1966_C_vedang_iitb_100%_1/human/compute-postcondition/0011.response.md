Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `sz` is the next element in `a`, and `mexsize` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers in ascending order, and `maxsize` remains the maximum value in `a`. The next element in `a` is still `sz`, and `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The `stdin` still contains `t-1` lines of input.
