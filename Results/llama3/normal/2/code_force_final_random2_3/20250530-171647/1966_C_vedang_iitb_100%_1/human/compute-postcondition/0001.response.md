The only variable in the loop head is variable `tc` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, where each line contains an integer `n`, followed by a line with `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `tc` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, where each line contains an integer `n`, followed by a line with `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, `tc` is 0**
