Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `mexsize` is 2, `tc` is 0, and the current value of `sz` is equal to `mexsize` (which is 2).**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The value of `sz` is still equal to `mexsize`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
