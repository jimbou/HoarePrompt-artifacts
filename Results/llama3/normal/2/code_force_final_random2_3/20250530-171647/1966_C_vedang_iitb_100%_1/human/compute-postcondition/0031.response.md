Output State: **`mexsize` is either 3 or 4, `sz` is the third element in the sorted list `a`, `tc` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `mexsize` has been incremented by 1, so it can be either 3 or 4. The other variables remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The list `a` is still sorted and has at least 3 elements, and `sz` is still the third element in this list. The values of `tc`, `t`, `n`, and `maxsize` are also unchanged. The stdin still contains no inputs.
