Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing 22 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding `i`, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, and 20 is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged, but `ans` now contains 22 integers. The first three integers in `ans` are `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and the remaining 19 integers are `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding `i`. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged.
