The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. The list `ans` contains three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. Additionally, since `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` contains additional elements which are powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19 because `j` ranges from 0 to 19.

Output: **k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536 (where k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, i is less than or equal to the number of bits required to represent k - 1 and is incremented by 1)**
