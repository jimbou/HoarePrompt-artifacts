The only variable in the loop head is `tc` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `tc` is now 0. Also, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n).

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n), `tc` is 0**
