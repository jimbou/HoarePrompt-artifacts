The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 20, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is less than or equal to the number of bits required to represent `k - 1` and is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, `j` is 1, and 20 is greater than 1. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`.**
