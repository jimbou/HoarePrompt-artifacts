The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and the constant 20, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the constant 20. If 20 is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 0 and 20 is greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, `j` is 0, 20 is greater than 0**
