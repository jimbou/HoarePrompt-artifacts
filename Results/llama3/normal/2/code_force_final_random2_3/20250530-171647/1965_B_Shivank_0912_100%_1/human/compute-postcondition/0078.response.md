Based on the initial state, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000.
* `tc` is 2.
* `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive.
* `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n`.
* `i` is the greatest integer less than or equal to log2(k).
* `j` is 20.
* `ans` is a list containing twenty-one integers if `i` is less than 20, and twenty integers otherwise.

The print statement `print(*ans)` will print the elements of the `ans` list.

If `i` is less than 20, the `ans` list will contain:

* `k - (1 << i)`
* `k + 1`
* `k + 1 + (1 << i)`
* `1 << j` for all `j` in range(20) where `j` is not equal to `i`

Since `j` is 20, the last element will be `1 << 20`.

If `i` is not less than 20, the `ans` list will contain:

* `k - (1 << i)`
* `k + 1`
* `k + 1 + (1 << i)`
* `1 << j` for all `j` in range(20)

In this case, the last element will be `1 << 19`.

Therefore, the output will be a list of integers, where the first three elements are `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, followed by a sequence of powers of 2, either up to `1 << 20` or up to `1 << 19`, depending on the value of `i`.

Output: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144] (if i is less than 20) or [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536] (if i is not less than 20)**
