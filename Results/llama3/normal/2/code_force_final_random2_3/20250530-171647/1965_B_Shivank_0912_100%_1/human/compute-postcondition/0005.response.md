The variable in the loop head is i and k, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and k. If 1 << i + 1 is less than or equal to k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, k is an integer between 2 and n inclusive. i being 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to i is greater than 1. k being an integer between 2 and n inclusive does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to k is greater than or equal to 1 << i + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, tc is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and n inclusive and k is greater than or equal to 1 << i + 1, i is greater than 1, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers.**
