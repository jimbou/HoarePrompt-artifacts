Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, tc is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, i is 0, ans is a list containing 22 integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), and 1 << j for all j from 0 to 19 excluding i, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, 20 is greater than 0, and the length of the list ans which is 22 is being printed, and the elements of the list ans which are k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), and 1 << j for all j from 0 to 19 excluding i are being printed
Code of the loop:
while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
    i = i + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing 22 integers: `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding 0, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, 20 is greater than 0, and the length of the list `ans` which is 22 is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` which are `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding 0 are being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing 22 integers: `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding 0, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, 20 is greater than 0, and the length of the list `ans` which is 22 is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` which are `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding 0 are being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is less than or equal to the number of bits required to represent `k - 1` and is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing 22 integers: `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding 0, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, 20 is greater than 0, and the length of the list `ans` which is 22 is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` which are `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding 0 are being printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
