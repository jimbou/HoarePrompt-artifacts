To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `k` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 2, and `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << i + 1`.

To guarantee the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `1 << i + 1` is still less than or equal to `k`. Since `i` is greater than 2, we can increment `i` by 1, making it greater than 3. Now, `1 << i + 1` will be greater than `1 << 3 + 1`, which is 16.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << i + 1`, which is now greater than or equal to 16. Therefore, `k` must be greater than or equal to 16.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 16 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is greater than 3, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers.**
