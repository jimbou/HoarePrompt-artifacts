Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is less than or equal to the number of bits required to represent `k - 1` and is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing 22 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding `i`, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, 20 is greater than 0, and the length of the list `ans` which is 22 is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` which are `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding `i` are being printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable `i` will be less than or equal to the number of bits required to represent `k - 1` and will be incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The loop will continue to execute until `1 << i + 1` is no longer less than or equal to `k`, at which point `i` will be the maximum value it can be without exceeding the number of bits required to represent `k - 1`.
