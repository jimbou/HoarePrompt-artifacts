Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`, and `j` is not equal to `i`, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, and 20 is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include an additional element, which is `1 << j`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains four integers, and `j` is not equal to `i`. The stdin still contains at least one line with two integers, and the value of 20 is still greater than 0.
