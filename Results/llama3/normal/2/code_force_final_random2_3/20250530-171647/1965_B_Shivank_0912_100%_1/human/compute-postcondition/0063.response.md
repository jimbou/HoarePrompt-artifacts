Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is the greatest integer less than or equal to log2(k), `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `j` is 19, and 20 is greater than 19, stdin contains at least 0 lines.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain unchanged except for `ans`, which is now a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. The value of `i` is still the greatest integer less than or equal to log2(k), which means that `i` is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
