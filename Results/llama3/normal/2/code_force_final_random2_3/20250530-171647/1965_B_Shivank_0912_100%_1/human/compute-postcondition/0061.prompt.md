Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, tc is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, i is 0, ans is a list containing three integers: k - (1 << 0), k + 1, and k + 1 + (1 << 0), stdin contains at least 0 lines, j is 19, and 20 is greater than 19. If j is not equal to i, ans contains additional elements which are powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19 because j ranges from 0 to 19, and the length of the list ans is being printed, and the elements of the list ans are being printed: [k - (1 << 0), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << 0), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536]
Code of the loop:
while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
    i = i + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and additional elements which are powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19, `j` is 19, and 20 is greater than 19, stdin contains at least 0 lines.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and additional elements which are powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19, `j` is 19, and 20 is greater than 19, stdin contains at least 0 lines.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 8 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and additional elements which are powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19, `j` is 19, and 20 is greater than 19, stdin contains at least 0 lines.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
