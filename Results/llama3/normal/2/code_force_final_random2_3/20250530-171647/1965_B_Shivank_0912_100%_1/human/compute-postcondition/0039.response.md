Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is less than or equal to the number of bits required to represent `k - 1` and is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, `j` is 0, and 20 is greater than 0. The current value of `j` is not equal to the current value of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the value `1 << j` to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `j` is still 0, and the value of `i` is still less than or equal to the number of bits required to represent `k - 1` and is incremented by 1. The stdin still contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers.
