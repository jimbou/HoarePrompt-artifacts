This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. For each test case, it generates a list of 21 integers based on the values of n and k, and then prints the length of the list followed by the list elements. The list contains the numbers k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), and 1 << j for all j in range(20) where j is not equal to i, where i is the greatest integer less than or equal to log2(k). The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases.
