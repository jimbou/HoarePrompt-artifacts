The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n). 

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the standard input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n)**
