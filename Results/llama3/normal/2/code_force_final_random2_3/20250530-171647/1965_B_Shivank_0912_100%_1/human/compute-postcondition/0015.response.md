The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 20, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not specified, but we know that the loop has executed at least once, so `j` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing three or four integers, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, and 20 is greater than 0. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` contains four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`. Otherwise, `ans` contains three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `j` is 1**
