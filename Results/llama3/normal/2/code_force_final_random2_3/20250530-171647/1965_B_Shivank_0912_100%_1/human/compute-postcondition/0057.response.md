According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `1 << i + 1` must be less than or equal to `k`, so `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << 2`, which is 4.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and additional elements which are powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19, `j` is 19, and 20 is greater than 19, stdin contains at least 0 lines.**
