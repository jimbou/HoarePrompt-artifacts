The only variable in the loop head is variable i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and k. If 1 << i + 1 is less than or equal to k, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, i is 0, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive. For the loop to execute the first time, k must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, tc is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers.**
