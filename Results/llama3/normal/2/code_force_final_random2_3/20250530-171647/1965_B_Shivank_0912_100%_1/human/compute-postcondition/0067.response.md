Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is the greatest integer less than or equal to log2(k), `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `j` is less than 20, and stdin contains at least 0 lines. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to contain four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`.***
