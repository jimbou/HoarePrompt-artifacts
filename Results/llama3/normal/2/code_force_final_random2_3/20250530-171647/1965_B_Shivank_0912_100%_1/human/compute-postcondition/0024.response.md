The code prints the elements of the list `ans`. The list `ans` contains 22 integers. The first three elements are `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. The remaining 19 elements are powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`, excluding `1 << i`.

Since the exact values of `k` and `i` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the list `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the 22 elements of the list `ans`.

Output: **k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), and 1 << j for all j from 0 to 19 excluding i (where k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, i is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(k), and n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive)**
