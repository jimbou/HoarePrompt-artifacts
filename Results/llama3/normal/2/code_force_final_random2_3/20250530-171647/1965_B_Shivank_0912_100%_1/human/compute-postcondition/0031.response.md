Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing 22 integers: `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding 0, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, 20 is greater than 0, and the length of the list `ans` which is 22 is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` which are `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding 0 are being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
