Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, tc is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, i is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(k), stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `i` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `k`. This is because the loop continues to increment `i` as long as `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`, which is equivalent to `i + 1` being less than or equal to `log2(k)`. Once `i` is greater than or equal to `log2(k)`, the loop condition is no longer satisfied, and the loop terminates.
