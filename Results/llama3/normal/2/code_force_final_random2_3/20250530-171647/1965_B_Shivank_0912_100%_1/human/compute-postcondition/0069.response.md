Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is the greatest integer less than or equal to log2(k), `j` is less than 21, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`, and stdin contains at least 0 lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still between 2 and 1000. The value of `tc` is still 2. The value of `n` is still between 2 and 10^6. The value of `k` is still between 2 and `n`. The value of `i` is still the greatest integer less than or equal to log2(k). The value of `j` is still less than 21. The list `ans` now contains four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`. The stdin still contains at least 0 lines.
