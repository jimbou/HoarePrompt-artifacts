Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, and 20 is greater than 0. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `j` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and the number of lines in stdin remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains four integers, where the last integer is `1 << j`. If `j` is not equal to `i`, then `j` is 2.
