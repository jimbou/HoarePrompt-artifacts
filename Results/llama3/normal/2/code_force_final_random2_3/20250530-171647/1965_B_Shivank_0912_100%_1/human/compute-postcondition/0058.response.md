The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 1, so the new value of `i` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << 0)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << 0)`, and additional elements which are powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19, `j` is 19, and 20 is greater than 19, stdin contains at least 0 lines.**
