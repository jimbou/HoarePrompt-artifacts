Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `i` is the greatest integer less than or equal to `log2(k)`, which means `i` is the largest integer such that `2^i` is less than or equal to `k`.
* Since `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, we know that `k` is at least 2 and at most 10^6.
* The value of `i` is therefore at most 19, since `2^20` is greater than 10^6.
* If `i` is less than 20, the list `ans` contains 21 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` in range(20) where `j` is not equal to `i`.
* If `i` is 20, the list `ans` contains 20 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` in range(20).

Since `i` is at most 19, we know that `ans` will always contain 21 integers if `i` is less than 20, and 20 integers if `i` is 20.

Therefore, the output of the `print(len(ans))` statement will be:

Output: **21 (if i is less than 20), 20 (if i is 20)**
