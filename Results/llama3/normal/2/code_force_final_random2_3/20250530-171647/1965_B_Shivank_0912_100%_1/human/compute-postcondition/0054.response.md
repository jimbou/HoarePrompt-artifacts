Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, tc is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, i is 0, ans is a list containing three integers: k - (1 << 0), k + 1, and k + 1 + (1 << 0), stdin contains at least 0 lines, j is 19, and 20 is greater than 19. If j is not equal to i, ans contains additional elements which are powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19 because j ranges from 0 to 19, and the length of the list ans is being printed, and the elements of the list ans are being printed: [k - (1 << 0), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << 0), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536]**
