Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is less than or equal to the number of bits required to represent `k - 1` and is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, `j` is 19, and 20 is greater than 19. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` contains additional elements which are powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19 because `j` ranges from 0 to 19.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ans` will contain the initial three elements `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and additional elements which are powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19, except for the power of 2 that is equal to `1 << i`. The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `j` is 19 after the loop finishes executing.
