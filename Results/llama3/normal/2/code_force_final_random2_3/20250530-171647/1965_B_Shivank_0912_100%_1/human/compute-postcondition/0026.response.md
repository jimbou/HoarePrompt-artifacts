To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for tc in range(t):`. The variables involved are `tc` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` is 0, and `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.

For the loop to execute again, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` needs to remain the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `tc` is 1
* `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `ans`, and the contents of `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing 22 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding `i`, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, and 20 is greater than 0, and the length of the list `ans` which is 22 is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` which are `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding `i` are being printed**
