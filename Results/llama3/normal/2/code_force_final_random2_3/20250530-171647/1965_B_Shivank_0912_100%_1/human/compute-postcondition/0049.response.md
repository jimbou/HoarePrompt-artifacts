Based on the precondition, the value of `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. However, if `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` contains additional elements which are powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19 because `j` ranges from 0 to 19.

Since `j` is 19 and 20 is greater than 19, `j` is not equal to `i`. Therefore, `ans` contains additional elements which are powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19.

The length of `ans` is the number of elements in the list. Since `ans` contains three integers and additional elements which are powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19, the length of `ans` is 3 + 20 = 23.

Output: **23**
