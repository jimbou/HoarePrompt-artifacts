The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the length of the list `ans`. 

The list `ans` contains 22 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding `i`. 

Since the exact values of `k` and `i` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the list `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the list `ans` will always have 22 elements.

Therefore, the `print(len(ans))` statement will output the number 22.

Output: **22**
