Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, tc is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and n inclusive, i is 1, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after the increment, `i` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`) and the state of `stdin` remain unchanged.
