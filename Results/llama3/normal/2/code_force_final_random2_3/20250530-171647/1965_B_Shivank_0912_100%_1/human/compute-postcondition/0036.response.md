Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is less than or equal to the number of bits required to represent `k - 1` and is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, 20 is greater than 0, and the length of the list `ans` which is 3 is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` which are `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` are being printed.**

In this output state, the list `ans` has been updated to contain only three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and the length of the list `ans` is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
