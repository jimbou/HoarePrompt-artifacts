Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 16 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is greater than 4, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was initially greater than 3, it is now greater than 4. The values of the other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged. The state of the stdin also remains the same, containing at least 1 line with two integers.
