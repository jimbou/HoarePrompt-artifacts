Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `ans` is assigned a list of three integers, where the first element is `k - (1 << i)`, the second element is `k + 1`, and the third element is `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. The value of `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), which means it is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `k`. The stdin still contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers.
