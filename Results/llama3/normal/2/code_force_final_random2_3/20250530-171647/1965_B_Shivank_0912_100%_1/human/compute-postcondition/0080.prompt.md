Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n)
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    i = 0
    while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
        i = i + 1
    ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
    for j in range(20):
        if j != i:
            ans.append(1 << j)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to log2(`k`), `ans` is a list containing 22 integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding `i`, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, and 20 is greater than 0, and the length of the list `ans` which is 22 is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` which are `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 excluding `i` are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is less than or equal to the number of bits required to represent `k - 1` and is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, `j` is 19, and 20 is greater than 19. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` contains additional elements which are powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19 because `j` ranges from 0 to 19, and the length of the list `ans` is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is the greatest integer less than or equal to log2(k), `j` is 20, and stdin contains at least 0 lines. If `i` is less than 20, `ans` is a list containing twenty-one integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` in range(20) where `j` is not equal to `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing twenty integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` for all `j` in range(20), and the length of ans which is either 20 or 21 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
