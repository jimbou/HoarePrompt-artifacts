Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `i` is less than or equal to the number of bits required to represent `k - 1` and is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j` if `j` is not equal to `i`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing three integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, `ans` now contains an additional element which is 4 because j is 2, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers, `j` is 2, and 20 is greater than 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000. The value of `tc` is still 1. The value of `n` is still an integer between 2 and 10^6. The value of `k` is still an integer between 1 and `n`. The value of `i` is still less than or equal to the number of bits required to represent `k - 1` and is incremented by 1. The list `ans` now contains an additional element which is 4 because `j` is 2. The stdin still contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers. The value of `j` is still 2. The inequality 20 is greater than 2 is still valid.
