Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, tc is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers.**

The code reads a line from stdin, assigning the values of `n` and `k` to the corresponding variables. The value of `n` is between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, and the value of `k` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. The variable `i` is initialized to 0. The values of `t` and `tc` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains at least 1 line less than before, each containing two integers.
