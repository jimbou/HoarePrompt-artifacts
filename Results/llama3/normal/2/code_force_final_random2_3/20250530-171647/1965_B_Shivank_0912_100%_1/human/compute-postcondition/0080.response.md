Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1000, tc is equal to t, n is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, i is the greatest integer less than or equal to log2(k), ans is a list containing twenty-one integers: k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), and 1 << j for all j in range(20) where j is not equal to i, stdin contains at least t lines, each containing two integers, and the length of the list ans which is 21 is being printed, and the elements of the list ans which are k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), and 1 << j for all j in range(20) where j is not equal to i are being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables `tc`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `ans` have reached their final values. The value of `tc` is equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The values of `n` and `k` are still within their respective ranges, and `i` is the greatest integer less than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `k`. The list `ans` contains twenty-one integers, including `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and powers of 2 from 1 to 2^19, excluding the power of 2 that is equal to `1 << i`. The length of the list `ans` is being printed, and the elements of the list `ans` are being printed. The input stream `stdin` contains at least `t` lines, each containing two integers.
