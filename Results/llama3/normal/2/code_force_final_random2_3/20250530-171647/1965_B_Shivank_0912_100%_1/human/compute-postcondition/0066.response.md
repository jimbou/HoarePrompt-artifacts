Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n`, `i` is the greatest integer less than or equal to log2(k), `ans` is a list containing four integers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and `1 << j`, and `j` is less than 20, and stdin contains at least 0 lines. The current value of `j` is not equal to `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is `1 << j`, where `j` is less than 20 and not equal to `i`. The other elements in the list `ans` remain the same. The stdin still contains at least 0 lines.
