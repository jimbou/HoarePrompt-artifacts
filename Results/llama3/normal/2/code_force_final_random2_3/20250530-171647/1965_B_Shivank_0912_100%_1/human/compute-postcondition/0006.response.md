The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was greater than 1, so the new value of `i` is greater than 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n` inclusive and `k` is greater than or equal to 1 << `i` + 1, `i` is greater than 2, stdin contains at least 1 line, each containing two integers.**
