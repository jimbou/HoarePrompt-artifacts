Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, n must be greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters from s, stdin is empty. If the number of unique letters in a is exactly 1, then 'NO' is printed. If the number of unique letters in a is more than 1, then 'YES' is printed, b is a string consisting of the letters of s in ascending order, and c is a string consisting of the letters of s in descending order. If the letters in s are in ascending order, then c is printed. Otherwise, b is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of strings from standard input, checks if each string is composed of unique letters, and prints 'YES' if it is, followed by the string sorted in ascending or descending order depending on its original order. If the string contains only one unique letter, it prints 'NO'. The function processes a number of strings specified by an initial integer input, and it does not return any value.

Correctness: **True** or **False**
