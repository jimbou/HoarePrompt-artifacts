According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and stdin contains n strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. So for the loop to be executed  `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains n strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
