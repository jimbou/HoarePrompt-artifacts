Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string has more than one character that appears only once. In this case, the program will output the sorted string or the reverse sorted string, which may be equal to the original string. For example, if the input string is "ab", the program will output "ab" which is equal to the original string.

The program should check if there is at least one character that appears more than once, and if so, it should try to swap the positions of two characters to create a new string that is not equal to the original string. If no such swap is possible, then the program should output "NO".
