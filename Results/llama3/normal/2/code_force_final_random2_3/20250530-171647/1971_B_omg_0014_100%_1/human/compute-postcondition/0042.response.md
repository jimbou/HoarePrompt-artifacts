Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 1000, n must be greater than 1, i is 2, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters from s, stdin contains n-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, b is a string consisting of the sorted lowercase English letters from s, c is a string consisting of the sorted lowercase English letters from s in reverse order, and 'YES' is being printed. If the string s is already sorted in ascending order (i.e., b == s), then the string c, which is the sorted lowercase English letters from s in reverse order, is being printed. Otherwise, the sorted lowercase English letters from s, which is b, is being printed.***
