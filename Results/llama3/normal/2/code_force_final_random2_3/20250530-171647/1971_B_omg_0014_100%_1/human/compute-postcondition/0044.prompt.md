Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains n strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 1 and 1000, n must be greater than 0, i is 0, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters from s, stdin contains n-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the number of unique letters in a is exactly 1, then 'NO' is printed. If the number of unique letters in a is more than 1, then 'YES' is printed, b is a string consisting of the letters of s in ascending order, and c is a string consisting of the letters of s in descending order. If the letters in s are in ascending order, then c is printed. Otherwise, b is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 1000, n must be greater than 0, i is 1, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters from s, stdin contains n-3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the number of unique letters in s is 1, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed. If the letters in s are already in alphabetical order, the letters of s in reverse alphabetical order are printed. Otherwise, the letters of s in alphabetical order are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 1000, n must be greater than 1, i is 2, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters from s, stdin contains n-5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of a is 1, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed, and if the string s is already sorted in ascending order, the string c, which is the sorted lowercase English letters from s in reverse order, is being printed. Otherwise, the sorted lowercase English letters from s, which is b, is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
