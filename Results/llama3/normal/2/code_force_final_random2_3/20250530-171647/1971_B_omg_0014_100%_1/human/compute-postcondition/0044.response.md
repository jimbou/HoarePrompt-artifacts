Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000, n must be greater than or equal to 0, i is n-1, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, a is a set of unique lowercase English letters from s, stdin is empty. If the number of unique letters in a is exactly 1, then 'NO' is printed. If the number of unique letters in a is more than 1, then 'YES' is printed, b is a string consisting of the letters of s in ascending order, and c is a string consisting of the letters of s in descending order. If the letters in s are in ascending order, then c is printed. Otherwise, b is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be the same as the initial value, but `i` will be one less than `n`. The string `s` will be the last string read from the input, and `a` will be the set of unique letters in that string. The input stream will be empty, as all strings have been read. The output will depend on the number of unique letters in `a`: if there is only one unique letter, 'NO' will be printed; otherwise, 'YES' will be printed, and either the sorted string `b` or the reverse-sorted string `c` will be printed, depending on whether the original string `s` was already sorted in ascending order.
