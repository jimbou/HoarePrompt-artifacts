The code prints a string consisting of the letters of `s` in ascending order. Since `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, and `b` is a string consisting of the letters of `s` in ascending order, the output will be a string of lowercase English letters in ascending order, with a maximum length of 10.

Output: **a string of lowercase English letters in ascending order, with a maximum length of 10**
