This function reads a series of strings from standard input, checks if each string is composed of unique letters, and prints 'YES' if it is, followed by the string sorted in ascending or descending order depending on its original order. If the string contains only one unique letter, it prints 'NO'. The function processes a number of strings specified by an initial integer input, and it does not return any value.
