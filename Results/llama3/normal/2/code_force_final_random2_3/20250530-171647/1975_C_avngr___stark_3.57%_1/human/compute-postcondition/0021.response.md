Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 1, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. If the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[0]` is greater than the current `max`, then `max` is updated to be the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[0]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
