Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is 0, i is not defined, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

The code snippet provided reads an integer `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`, overwriting its initial value. It then reads a list of `n` integers from the input, splits them into a list, and assigns this list to the variable `a`, overwriting its initial value. The variable `max` is initialized to 0, overwriting its initial value as the maximum of the minimums of adjacent pairs of elements in `a`. The variable `i` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so its initial value is lost. The variable `_` and `t` are not affected by the code snippet, so they retain their initial values. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two.
