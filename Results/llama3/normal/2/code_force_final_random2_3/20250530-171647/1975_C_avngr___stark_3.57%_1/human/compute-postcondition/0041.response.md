Output State: **_* is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is the minimum of a[3] and a[2], and i is 3, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of max has been updated to be the minimum of a[3] and a[2], which are the third and second elements of the list a, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
