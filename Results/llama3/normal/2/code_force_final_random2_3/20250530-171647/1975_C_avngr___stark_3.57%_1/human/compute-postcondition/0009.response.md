Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max` is either 0 or the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2. If the minimum of the second and third elements of `a` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the minimum of the second and third elements of `a`.***
