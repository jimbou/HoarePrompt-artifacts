Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `max` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `max` is the minimum of the second and third elements of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `max` is now a specific integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), which is the smaller of the two elements `a[2]` and `a[1]`.
