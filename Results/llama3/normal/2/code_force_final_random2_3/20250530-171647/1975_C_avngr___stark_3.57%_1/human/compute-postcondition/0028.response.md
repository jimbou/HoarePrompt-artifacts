Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is the maximum of the minimums of adjacent pairs of elements in a, i is n - 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the variable `max` will hold the maximum of the minimums of adjacent pairs of elements in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
