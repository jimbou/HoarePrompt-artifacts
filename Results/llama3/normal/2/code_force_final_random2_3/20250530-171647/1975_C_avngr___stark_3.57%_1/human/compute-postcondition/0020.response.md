Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[0]`, `i` is 1, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be the minimum of the first two elements of the list `a`, which are `a[1]` and `a[0]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
