The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 2, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two.**
