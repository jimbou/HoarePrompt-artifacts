To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5) on the first line, and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) on the second line.**
