The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 500) is given in the first line of the input.

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The stdin now contains multiple test cases, but the first line of the input (which contained the number of test cases) has been consumed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5) on the first line, and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) on the second line.**
