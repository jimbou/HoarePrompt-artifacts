Postcondition: **_ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), if the minimum of a[1] and a[0] is greater than max, then max is updated to the minimum of a[1] and a[0], otherwise max remains 0, i is 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
