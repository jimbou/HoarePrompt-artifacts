The code assigns the value of the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to `max`. The current value of `max` is less than the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, so `max` will be updated to the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1.**
