The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and i is now 1. 
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1**
