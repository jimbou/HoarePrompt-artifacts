Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is t, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is the maximum of the minimum of all adjacent pairs of elements in a, i is n - 1, and stdin contains no test cases, and the maximum of the minimum of all adjacent pairs of elements in a which is max is being printed**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The values of `n`, `a`, `max`, and `i` will be the same as after the last iteration of the loop. The stdin will be empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The maximum of the minimum of all adjacent pairs of elements in `a` will be printed as the final output.
