Postcondition: ***_* is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than 2, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and i is 3. If the minimum of a[3] and a[2] is greater than max, then max is updated to be the minimum of a[3] and a[2]. Otherwise, max remains unchanged. stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.***
