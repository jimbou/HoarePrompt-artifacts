Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is 0, i is n - 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from the input to `a`. The third line initializes `max` to 0. 

After the execution of the code, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), and `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The value of `max` is 0. The value of `i` is `n - 1`. The value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.
