Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is the maximum of the minimum of all adjacent pairs of elements in a, i is n - 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the variable `_` remains unchanged at 2, `t` remains an integer greater than 2, `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), and `a` remains a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The variable `max` is updated to be the maximum of the minimum of all adjacent pairs of elements in the list `a`. The loop counter `i` reaches `n - 1` after the loop finishes executing. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus two.
