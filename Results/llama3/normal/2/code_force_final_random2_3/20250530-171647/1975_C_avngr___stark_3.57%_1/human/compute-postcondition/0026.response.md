Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 3, `max` is the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`, which are the values at indices `i` and `i-1` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
