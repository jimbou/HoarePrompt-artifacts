The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max` is the maximum of the minimums of adjacent pairs of elements in `a`, `i` is `n` - 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the maximum of the minimums of adjacent pairs of elements in `a` is printed**
