The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max` is either 0 or the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2**
