Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 3, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. If the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to be the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.***
