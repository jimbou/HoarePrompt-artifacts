The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `i` is 3, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. If the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to be the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`.**
