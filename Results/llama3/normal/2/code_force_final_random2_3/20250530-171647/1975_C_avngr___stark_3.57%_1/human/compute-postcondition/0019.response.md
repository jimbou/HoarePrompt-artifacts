Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max` is 0, `i` is 1, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. The current value of `max` is updated to be less than the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.**
