Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5) on the first line, and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) on the second line.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
            max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is the maximum of the minimum of a[i] and a[i - 1] for all i from 1 to n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, and the maximum of the minimum of a[i] and a[i - 1] for all i from 1 to n - 1 which is max is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is the maximum of the minimums of adjacent pairs of elements in a, i is n - 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the maximum of the minimums of adjacent pairs of elements in a is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is the maximum of the minimum of all adjacent pairs of elements in a, i is n - 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the maximum of the minimum of all adjacent pairs of elements in a which is max is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
