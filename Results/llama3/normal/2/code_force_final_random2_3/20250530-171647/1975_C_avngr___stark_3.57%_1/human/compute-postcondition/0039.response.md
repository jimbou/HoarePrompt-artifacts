Postcondition: ***_ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), if the minimum of a[2] and a[1] is greater than max, then max is updated to the minimum of a[2] and a[1], otherwise max remains 0, and i is 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.***
