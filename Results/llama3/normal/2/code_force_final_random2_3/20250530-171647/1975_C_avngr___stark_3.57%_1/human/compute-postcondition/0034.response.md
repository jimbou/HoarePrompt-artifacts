Postcondition: ***_ is 2, t is an integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than 1, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), max is 0, i is 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The current value of min(a[i], a[i - 1]) is greater than the current value of max***
