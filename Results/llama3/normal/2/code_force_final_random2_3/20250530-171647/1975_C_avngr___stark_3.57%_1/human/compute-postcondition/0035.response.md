Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `max` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[0]`, `i` is 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `max` has been updated to be the minimum of the first two elements of the list `a`, which is `min(a[1], a[0])`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `max` is now greater than 0, since the minimum of two positive integers is always greater than 0.
