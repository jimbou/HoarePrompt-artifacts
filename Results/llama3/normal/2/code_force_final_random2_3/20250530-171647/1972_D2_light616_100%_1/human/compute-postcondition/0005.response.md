To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable that takes on the value of the current iteration. The loop will execute as long as the value of `_` is less than `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed. Since `_` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we can assume its value is the current iteration number, which is 1 (since `t` is greater than 1).

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, stdin contains no input, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

Note that the state of `func_1()` is not changed, as it is not a variable in the loop head.
