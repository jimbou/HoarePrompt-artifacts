Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than 8, `m` is greater than or equal to 8, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((2 + 2) * 2)` and `m // ((2 + 2) * 2)`, which is the minimum of `n // 8` and `m // 8`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `x` and `y` remain the same, which are 2. The value of `n` is still greater than 8, and the value of `m` is still greater than or equal to 8. The value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n` divided by 8 and `m` divided by 8.
