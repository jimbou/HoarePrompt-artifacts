To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `m` must be greater than or equal to 15.

The code is: `cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`

First, let's calculate the values inside the `min` function:

- `x + y` is 2 + 3 = 5
- `n // ((x + y) * x)` is `n // (5 * 2)` = `n // 10`
- `m // ((x + y) * y)` is `m // (5 * 3)` = `m // 15`

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 10 and `m` is greater than or equal to 15, we can conclude that:

- `n // 10` is greater than or equal to 1
- `m // 15` is greater than or equal to 1

Now, let's analyze the `min` function:

- `min(n // 10, m // 15)` will return the minimum value between `n // 10` and `m // 15`, which is at least 1.

The `cnt` variable is incremented by this minimum value, so `cnt` will be increased by at least 1.

The output state is: `x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `m` must be greater than or equal to 15, `cnt` is increased by at least 1.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `m` must be greater than or equal to 15, `cnt` is increased by at least 1.**
