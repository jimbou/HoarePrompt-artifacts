Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying certain conditions. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the standard input and calculates the sum of the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all `x` and `y` such that `x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` and `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`. This function seems to be implementing the required calculation.

`func_2` reads a positive integer `t` from standard input, executes `func_1` `t` times, and leaves the standard input empty. This function appears to be handling the test cases.

Since `func_1` correctly implements the required calculation and `func_2` correctly handles the test cases, the given program meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
