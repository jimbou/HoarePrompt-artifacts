The value of `y` is incremented by 1, so `y` is now 2. The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is now 2, not 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `cnt` is no longer guaranteed to be at least 2.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than 9, `m` is greater than or equal to 20.**
