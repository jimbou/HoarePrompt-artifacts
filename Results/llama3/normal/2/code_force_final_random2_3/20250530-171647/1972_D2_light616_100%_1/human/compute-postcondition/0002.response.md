Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains no input, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

The code calls the function `func_1()`, but since the definition of this function is not provided, we cannot determine its specific effects on the program state. However, we can conclude that the function has been executed, and the values of the variables `t` and stdin remain unchanged.
