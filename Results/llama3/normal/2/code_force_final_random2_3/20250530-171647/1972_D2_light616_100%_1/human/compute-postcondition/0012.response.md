According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`. For the loop to execute again, the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` must be true.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `m` is greater than or equal to 6. Since `x` and `y` are already given, we can only adjust `n` and `m`.

For the first condition `(x + y) * x <= n` to be true, `n` must be greater than or equal to `(x + y) * x = (1 + 3) * 1 = 4`.

For the second condition `(x + y) * y <= m` to be true, `m` must be greater than or equal to `(x + y) * y = (1 + 3) * 3 = 12`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`x` is 1, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 12**
