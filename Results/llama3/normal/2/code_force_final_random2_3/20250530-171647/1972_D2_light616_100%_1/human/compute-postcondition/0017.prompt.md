Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is a positive integer, `y` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a positive integer t minus 1. Each subsequent line contains two positive integers n and m.
Code of the loop:
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
        cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
    y += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `y` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 4` and `m // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 6, `y` is 3, stdin contains multiple lines of input. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 3` and `m // 6`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: **`x` is 1, `y` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 12. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + 4) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + 4) * 4)`.

In this output state, the value of `y` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for increasing `cnt` is still valid, but the values used in the calculation have changed due to the new value of `y`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
