The only variable in the loop head is variable x and n, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and n.  If x * x is less than or equal to n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 3 and n is greater than or equal to 14, So for the loop to be executed one more time x must be less than or equal to 3 and n must be greater than 9.
State: **`x` is less than or equal to 3, `y` is 5, `n` is greater than 9, `m` is greater than or equal to 20**
