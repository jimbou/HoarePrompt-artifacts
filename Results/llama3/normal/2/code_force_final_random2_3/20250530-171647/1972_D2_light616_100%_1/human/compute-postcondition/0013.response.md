Output State: **`x` is 1, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 12, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + 3) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + 3) * 3)`**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 4` and `m // 12`. The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` remain the same as in the initial state.
