According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`. For the loop to execute again, two conditions must be met:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, and `m` is greater than or equal to 3.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the states of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` as follows:

* `x` and `y` can remain the same, as their values do not affect the conditions.
* `n` must be greater than or equal to `(x + y) * x`, which is `(2 + 2) * 2 = 8`. So, `n` must be greater than or equal to 8.
* `m` must be greater than or equal to `(x + y) * y`, which is `(2 + 2) * 2 = 8`. So, `m` must be greater than or equal to 8.

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `m` is greater than or equal to 8**
