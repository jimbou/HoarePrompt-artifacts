Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 14, `m` is greater than or equal to 20. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 14` and `m // 20`.**

The loop executes until the condition `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` is no longer met. After the third iteration, `x` is 2, `y` is 4, `n` is greater than 10, and `m` is greater than 15. In the next iteration, `y` is incremented to 5, and the condition becomes `(2 + 5) * 2 <= n and (2 + 5) * 5 <= m`, which simplifies to `14 <= n and 35 <= m`. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is `x` is 2, `y` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 14, and `m` is greater than or equal to 20. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 14` and `m // 20`.
