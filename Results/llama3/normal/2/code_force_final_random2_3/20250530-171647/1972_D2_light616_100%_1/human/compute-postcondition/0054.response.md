Output State: **x is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, y is m + 1, cnt is the sum of the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y) for all x and y such that x * x <= n and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m and math.gcd(x, y) == 1.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of x will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, and the value of y will be m + 1. The value of cnt will be the sum of the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y) for all x and y such that x * x <= n and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m and math.gcd(x, y) == 1. This means that cnt will be the sum of the minimum of the number of times (x + y) * x divides n and the number of times (x + y) * y divides m, for all pairs of x and y that satisfy the given conditions.
