The value of `y` is incremented by 1, so `y` is now 2. The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 2, so `cnt` is not increased. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `m` is greater than or equal to 3.
Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `m` is greater than or equal to 3.**
