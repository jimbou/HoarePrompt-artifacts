According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `n`. If `x * x` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. `n` being greater than or equal to `m + 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`x` is 2, `y` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to `m * (m + 1)`**
