Reasoning: 

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b.

Function 1 reads two positive integers n and m from the standard input, calculates the sum of the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y) for all x and y such that x * x <= n and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m and math.gcd(x, y) == 1, and prints the result.

Function 2 reads a positive integer t from standard input, executes the function func_1() t times, and leaves the standard input empty.

The given program is correct because it meets the problem description. Function 1 correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions, and Function 2 correctly executes Function 1 for the specified number of test cases.

Correctness: **True**
