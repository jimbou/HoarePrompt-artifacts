Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a positive integer t. Each subsequent line contains two positive integers n and m.
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: x is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, y is m + 1, cnt is the sum of the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y) for all x and y such that x * x <= n and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m and math.gcd(x, y) == 1.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the sum of the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y) for all x and y such that x * x <= n and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m and math.gcd(x, y) == 1)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads two positive integers n and m from the standard input, calculates the sum of the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y) for all x and y such that x * x <= n and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m and math.gcd(x, y) == 1, and prints the result.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a positive integer t, representing the number of test cases.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input, and the function `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a positive integer t from standard input, executes the function func_1() t times, and leaves the standard input empty.
