Output State: `x` is 2, `y` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `m` is greater than or equal to 15, `cnt` is increased by at least 2.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: `x` remains 2, `y` is increased to 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `m` is greater than or equal to 15, and `cnt` is increased by at least 2.
