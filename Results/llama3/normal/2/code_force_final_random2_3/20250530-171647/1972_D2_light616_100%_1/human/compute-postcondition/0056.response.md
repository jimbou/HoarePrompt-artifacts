Output: **x is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, y is m + 1, cnt is the sum of the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y) for all x and y such that x * x <= n and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m and math.gcd(x, y) == 1, and the count of the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y) for all x and y such that x * x <= n and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m and math.gcd(x, y) == 1 is printed**
