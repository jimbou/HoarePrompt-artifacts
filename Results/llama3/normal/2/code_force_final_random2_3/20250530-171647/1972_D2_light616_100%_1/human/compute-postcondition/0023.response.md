To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step by step.

Given Initial State:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `n` is greater than or equal to 6
- `m` is greater than or equal to 3
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1

Code Snippet:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Calculate `x + y`**: Since `x` is 2 and `y` is 1, `x + y` equals 3.

2. **Calculate `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y`**: 
   - `(x + y) * x` equals `3 * 2` which is 6.
   - `(x + y) * y` equals `3 * 1` which is 3.

3. **Calculate `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`**:
   - Since `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `n // 6` will be at least 1 (because 6 divided by 6 is 1, and any number greater than 6 divided by 6 will be more than 1).
   - Since `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `m // 3` will be at least 1 (because 3 divided by 3 is 1, and any number greater than 3 divided by 3 will be more than 1).

4. **Determine `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`**:
   - The minimum between `n // 6` and `m // 3` will be at least 1, considering the minimum values of `n` and `m` from the initial state.

5. **Update `cnt`**:
   - `cnt` is incremented by the minimum value calculated above, which is at least 1.

Output State:
**`x` is 2, `y` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is increased by at least 1.**

Note: The exact value of `cnt` cannot be determined without knowing its initial value, but we can confirm it increases by at least 1.
