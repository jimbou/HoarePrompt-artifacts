Output State: **`x` is 1, `y` is `m + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to `m * (m + 1)`. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // ((1 + m + 1) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + m + 1) * (m + 1))`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been incremented by `m` times, so it is now `m + 1`. The value of `n` has been increased to be greater than or equal to `m + 1`, and the value of `m` has been increased to be greater than or equal to `m * (m + 1)`. The condition for increasing `cnt` is still valid, but the values used in the calculation have changed due to the new value of `y`.
