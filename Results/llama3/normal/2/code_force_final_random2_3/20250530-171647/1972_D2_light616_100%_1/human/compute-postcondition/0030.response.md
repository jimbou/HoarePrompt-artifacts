To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement. The loop will continue as long as two conditions are met:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `x` is 2
- `y` is 3
- `n` is greater than or equal to 8
- `m` is greater than or equal to 8

We need to adjust the states so that both conditions are still satisfied for the next iteration. The variables in the loop head that we can adjust are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

1. For the first condition `(x + y) * x <= n`, with `x` being 2 and `y` being 3, we have `(2 + 3) * 2 = 10`. To ensure this condition can be true again, `n` must be greater than 10.

2. For the second condition `(x + y) * y <= m`, with `x` being 2 and `y` being 3, we have `(2 + 3) * 3 = 15`. To ensure this condition can be true again, `m` must be greater than 15.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` must be greater than 10, `m` must be greater than 15**
