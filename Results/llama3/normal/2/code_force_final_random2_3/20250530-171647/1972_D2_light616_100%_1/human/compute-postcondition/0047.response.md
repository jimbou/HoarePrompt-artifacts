To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement and adjust the states of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` accordingly.

The loop condition is `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`. Given the current states:

- `x` is 2
- `y` is 3
- `n` is greater than 8
- `m` is greater than or equal to 8

We need to ensure that both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are met for the loop to execute again.

1. For the first condition `(x + y) * x <= n`:
   - Given `x` is 2 and `y` is 3, `(x + y)` is 5.
   - So, `5 * x` is 10.
   - Since `n` is greater than 8, it needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 10 to ensure this condition is met.

2. For the second condition `(x + y) * y <= m`:
   - Given `x` is 2 and `y` is 3, `(x + y)` is 5.
   - So, `5 * y` is 15.
   - Since `m` is greater than or equal to 8, it needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 15 to ensure this condition is met.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 10.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 15.

The states of `x` and `y` do not need to be adjusted since they are not the limiting factors for the loop to execute again based on the given conditions.

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `m` must be greater than or equal to 15**
