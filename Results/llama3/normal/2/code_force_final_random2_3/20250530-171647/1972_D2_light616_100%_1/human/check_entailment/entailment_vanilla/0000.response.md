Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the input values n and m, and calculates the number of valid pairs using a nested loop structure. The outer loop iterates over the possible values of x, where x is a factor of both a and b. The inner loop iterates over the possible values of y, where y is also a factor of both a and b.

The program uses the mathematical property that gcd(a, b) = gcd(x, y) if a = x * k and b = y * k for some integer k. This allows the program to reduce the problem to counting the number of pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions.

The program also uses the fact that if x and y are coprime (i.e., gcd(x, y) = 1), then the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions is equal to the number of pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions, multiplied by the number of possible values of k.

The program calculates the number of valid pairs by iterating over the possible values of x and y, and for each pair, it calculates the number of possible values of k that satisfy the conditions. The program then sums up the number of valid pairs for each pair (x, y) to get the total number of valid pairs.

The program also handles the case where x = y = 1 separately, as this case does not fit into the general formula.

The program uses the `math.gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers, which is a built-in function in Python.

The program also uses the `min` function to calculate the minimum of two values, which is also a built-in function in Python.

The program uses the `//` operator to perform integer division, which is a built-in operator in Python.

The program uses the `*` operator to perform multiplication, which is a built-in operator in Python.

The program uses the `+` operator to perform addition, which is a built-in operator in Python.

The program uses the `<=` operator to perform comparison, which is a built-in operator in Python.

The program uses the `==` operator to perform comparison, which is a built-in operator in Python.

The program uses the `+=` operator to perform addition and assignment, which is a built-in operator in Python.

The program uses the `print` function to output the result, which is a built-in function in Python.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem.
