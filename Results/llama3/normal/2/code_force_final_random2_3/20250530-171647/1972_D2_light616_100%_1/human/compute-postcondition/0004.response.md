Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, stdin contains no input, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

The code snippet is simply a function call to `func_1()`, which has already been executed according to the initial state. Since the function has already been executed, there is no change in the state of the program. The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 1, and the stdin still contains no input. The function `func_1()` has already been executed, so there is no change in its state either.
