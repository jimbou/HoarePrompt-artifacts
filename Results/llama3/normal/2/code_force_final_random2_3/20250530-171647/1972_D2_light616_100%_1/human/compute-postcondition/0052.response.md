Output State: `x` is 2, `y` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `m` is greater than or equal to 15, `cnt` is increased by at least 1.

The loop will execute until the condition `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m` is no longer true. After the first 3 iterations, `x` remains 2, `y` becomes 4, `n` becomes greater than or equal to 10, and `m` becomes greater than or equal to 15. In the next iteration, `y` will be incremented to 5, and the condition will still be true. However, in the next iteration after that, `y` will be incremented to 6, and the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` will no longer be true because `(2 + 6) * 2 = 16` which is greater than `n` which is greater than or equal to 10. Therefore, the loop will terminate after the 4th iteration.

The value of `cnt` is increased by at least 1 because in the 3rd iteration, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 8` and `m // 8`, which is at least 1.
