According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`. For the loop to execute again, two conditions must be met:

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`
2. `(x + y) * y <= m`

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than 9, and `m` is greater than or equal to 20.

To ensure the first condition is met, we need to consider the values of `x`, `y`, and `n`. Since `x` and `y` are already 2, the expression `(x + y) * x` is 8. To satisfy the condition, `n` must be greater than 8.

For the second condition, we need to consider the values of `x`, `y`, and `m`. Since `x` and `y` are already 2, the expression `(x + y) * y` is 8. To satisfy the condition, `m` must be greater than or equal to 8.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

* `n` must be greater than 8 (instead of just greater than 9)
* `m` must be greater than or equal to 8 (instead of just greater than or equal to 20)

The other states, `x` and `y`, do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` must be greater than 8, `m` must be greater than or equal to 8**
