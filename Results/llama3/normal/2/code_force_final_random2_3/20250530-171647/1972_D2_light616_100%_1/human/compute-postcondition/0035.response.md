Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 14, `m` is greater than or equal to 20, if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n // 14` and `m // 20`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to 3, while the values of `y`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The condition regarding the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is still applicable, and if it is 1, `cnt` will be increased by the minimum of `n // 14` and `m // 20`.
