The value of `y` is changed to 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since `m` is greater than or equal to `m * (m + 1)`, we can conclude that `m` is either 0 or 1, because for any other value of `m`, `m * (m + 1)` would be greater than `m`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to `2 * 2`, we can conclude that `n` is greater than or equal to 4. The value of `x` is still 2.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `m` is either 0 or 1.**
