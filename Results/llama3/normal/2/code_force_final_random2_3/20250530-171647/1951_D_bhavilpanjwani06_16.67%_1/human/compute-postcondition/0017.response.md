Output: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`. `n` is not less than `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`. The current value of `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 2 is being printed**
