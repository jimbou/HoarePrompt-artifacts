This function determines whether it is possible to partition a set of `n` elements into `k` non-empty subsets, where `n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 10^18. It prints 'YES' if possible, along with the number of subsets and their sizes, and 'NO' otherwise. The function takes no arguments and reads input from stdin, where each line contains two positive integers `n` and `k`. The function handles three cases: (1) `n` is less than `k`, in which case it prints 'NO'; (2) `n` is equal to `k`, in which case it prints 'YES', 1, and `n`; and (3) `n` is greater than `k`, in which case it checks if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`, printing 'YES', 2, and `n-k+1` if true, and 'NO' otherwise.
