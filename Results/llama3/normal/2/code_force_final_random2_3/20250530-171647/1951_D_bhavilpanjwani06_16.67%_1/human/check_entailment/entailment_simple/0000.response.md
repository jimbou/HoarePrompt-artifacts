Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles all possible cases based on the problem description.

1.  If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with less than `k` coins.

2.  If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', 1, and `n`. This is because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins by spending all her coins at the first stall.

3.  If `n` is not equal to `k`, it checks if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`. If true, it prints 'YES', 2, and `n-k+1, 1`. This is because Alice can buy `k-1` jewels at the first stall with `n-k+1` coins and 1 jewel at the second stall with 1 coin.

4.  If `k-1` is not less than `n-k+1`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels in this case.

Correctness: **True**
