Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 10^18. If `n` is less than `k`, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not less than `k`, then if `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the value of `n` which is equal to `k` is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and `n-k+1` is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
