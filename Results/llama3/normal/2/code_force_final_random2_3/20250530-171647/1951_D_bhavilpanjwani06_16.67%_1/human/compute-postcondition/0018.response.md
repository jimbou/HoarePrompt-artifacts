The code prints the value of `n - k + 1`, which is the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and the number 1.

Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, the value of `n - k + 1` will also be a positive integer.

However, without knowing the exact values of `n` and `k`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `n - k + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `n - k + 1`, followed by the number 1.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n - k + 1 is the difference between n and k plus 1), 1**
