Reasoning: The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the expected output for each case.

The program first checks if `n` is less than `k`, in which case it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to partition `n` elements into `k` non-empty subsets. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', 1, and `n` because it is possible to partition `n` elements into `k` non-empty subsets of size 1.

If `n` is greater than `k`, the program checks if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`. If true, it prints 'YES', 2, and `n-k+1` because it is possible to partition `n` elements into `k` non-empty subsets by placing `n-k+1` elements in the first subset and 1 element in each of the remaining `k-1` subsets. If `k-1` is not less than `n-k+1`, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to partition `n` elements into `k` non-empty subsets.

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to partition a set of `n` elements into `k` non-empty subsets and prints the expected output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
