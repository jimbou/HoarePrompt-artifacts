Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three cases described in the problem statement:

1.  If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins.
2.  If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', 1, and `n` because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall with price `n`.
3.  If `n` is greater than `k`, it checks if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`. If true, it prints 'YES', 2, and `n-k+1` and 1. This is because Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from the first stall with price `n-k+1` and 1 jewel from the second stall with price 1. If `k-1` is not less than `n-k+1`, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to buy exactly `k` jewels.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
