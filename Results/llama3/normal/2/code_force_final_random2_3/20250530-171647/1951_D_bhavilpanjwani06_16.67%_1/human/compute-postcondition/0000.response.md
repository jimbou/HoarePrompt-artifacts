The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two positive integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n, k <= 10^18).

Since the code reads the first line of input, which contains two positive integers `n` and `k`, the values of `n` and `k` are now known. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, and the value of `k` is also a positive integer between 1 and 10^18.

The remaining input contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`.**
