Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is designed to find the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k, which is the number of buns sold at a modified price.

The function `func_1(k, n, a, b)` calculates the profit for a given value of k. It takes into account the profit from selling k buns at a modified price and the profit from selling the remaining (n-k) buns at the usual price.

The function `func_2(n, a, b)` uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k. It iteratively calculates the profit for the mid value of k and compares it with the profit for the next value of k. If the profit for the next value of k is greater, it updates the low value of the search range. Otherwise, it updates the high value of the search range.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where k is 0 or n. It also correctly handles the case where the modified price is greater than the usual price.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
