Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k, which is the number of buns sold at a modified price.

The program first defines a function `func_1` that calculates the profit for a given value of k. This function takes into account the modified price for the first k buns and the usual price for the remaining (n-k) buns.

The program then defines a function `func_2` that uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k. This function iteratively calculates the profit for the mid value of k and compares it with the profit for the next value of k. If the profit for the next value of k is greater, it updates the low value of the search range. Otherwise, it updates the high value of the search range.

The program finally returns the maximum profit that can be obtained from the given values of n, a, and b.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the binary search approach to find the optimal value of k. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the profit for a given value of k, and the `func_2` function correctly updates the search range based on the comparison of the profits for the mid and next values of k.

Correctness: **True**
