Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, mid is the integer average of low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid, low is either the integer average of the original low and high plus 1 (if profit_next is greater than profit_mid) or less than mid - 1 (if profit_next is not greater than profit_mid), high is either greater than or equal to mid - 1 (if profit_next is not greater than profit_mid) or not explicitly changed (if profit_next is greater than profit_mid).**

This output state reflects the changes made by the code snippet to the initial state. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `mid` is updated to be the integer average of `low` and `high`. The values of `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are updated based on the results of `func_1` called with different arguments. The value of `max_profit` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`. The values of `low` and `high` are updated based on the comparison between `profit_next` and `profit_mid`.
