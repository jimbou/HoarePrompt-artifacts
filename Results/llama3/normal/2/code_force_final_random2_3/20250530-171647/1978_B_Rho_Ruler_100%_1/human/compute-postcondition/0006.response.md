Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, low is 0, high is mid - 1, mid is the average of low and the original high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), and max_profit is the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid. Additionally, the profit of mid + 1 is less than or equal to the profit of mid.**

In this output state, the value of high has been updated to mid - 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between mid and high has also been updated, as mid is now the average of low and the original high. The rest of the conditions and relationships between variables remain the same as in the initial state.
