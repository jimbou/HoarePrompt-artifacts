Output State: **low is equal to high, and max_profit is the maximum profit that can be obtained from the given values of n, a, and b.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `low` is equal to `high`, and the variable `max_profit` is the maximum profit that can be obtained from the given values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. This is because the loop continues to execute until `low` is greater than `high`, at which point it terminates. At this point, `low` and `high` have converged to the same value, which is the optimal value that maximizes the profit. The variable `max_profit` is updated at each iteration to store the maximum profit that can be obtained, and it remains unchanged after the loop terminates. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.
