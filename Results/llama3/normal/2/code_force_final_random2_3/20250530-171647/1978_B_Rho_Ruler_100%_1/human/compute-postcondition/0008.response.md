The variables in the loop head are low and high, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables low and high. If low is less than or equal to high, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, low is an integer such that 1 <= low <= 10^9, and high is an integer such that 1 <= high <= 10^9. However, this does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so we need to adjust the states to ensure that low is less than or equal to high.

State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, low is less than or equal to high**
