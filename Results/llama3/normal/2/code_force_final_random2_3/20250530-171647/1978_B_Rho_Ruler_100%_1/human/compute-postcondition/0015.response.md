Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `mid` is the integer average of the original `low` and `high`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`, `low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is either greater than or equal to `mid - 1` (if `profit_next` is not greater than `profit_mid`) or not explicitly changed (if `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged. The value of `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`. The value of `high` remains the same if `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, but if `profit_next` is not greater than `profit_mid`, `high` is greater than or equal to `mid - 1`.
