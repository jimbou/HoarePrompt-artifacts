Postcondition: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9. After the if-else block, if the profit of mid + 1 is higher than the profit of mid, then low is updated to the average of the original low and high plus 1, and max_profit is updated to the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid. Otherwise, high is updated to mid - 1, and max_profit is updated to the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid.**
