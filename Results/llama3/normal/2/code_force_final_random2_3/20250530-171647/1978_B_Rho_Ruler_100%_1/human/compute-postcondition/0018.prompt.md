Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9, low is 0, high is the minimum of n and b, and max_profit is 0.
Code of the loop:
while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
    profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
    max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
    if profit_next > profit_mid:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9. After the if-else block, if the profit of mid + 1 is higher than the profit of mid, then low is updated to the average of the original low and high plus 1, and max_profit is updated to the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid. Otherwise, high is updated to mid - 1, and max_profit is updated to the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `mid` is the integer average of `low` and `high`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is the integer average of the original `low` and `high` plus 1 and `low` is greater than `mid`. Otherwise, `high` is `mid - 1` and `low` is less than `mid - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, mid is the integer average of low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid. If profit_next is greater than profit_mid, then low is set to mid + 1. Otherwise, low is set to less than mid - 1 and high is set to greater than or equal to mid - 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
