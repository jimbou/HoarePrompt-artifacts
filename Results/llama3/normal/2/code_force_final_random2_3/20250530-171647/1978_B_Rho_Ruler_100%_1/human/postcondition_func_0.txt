Calculates a value based on the input parameters k, n, a, and b, where k is an integer between 0 and the minimum of n and b, and n, a, and b are positive integers. The function returns a combination of the product of k and b, the difference between the product of k and k-1 divided by 2, and the product of n-k and a.
