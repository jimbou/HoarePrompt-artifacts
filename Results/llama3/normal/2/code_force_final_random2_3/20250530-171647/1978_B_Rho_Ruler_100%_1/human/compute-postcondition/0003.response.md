Postcondition: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, low is 0, high is the minimum of n and b, mid is the average of low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), and max_profit is the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid. The current value of profit_next is higher than the current value of profit_mid.**
