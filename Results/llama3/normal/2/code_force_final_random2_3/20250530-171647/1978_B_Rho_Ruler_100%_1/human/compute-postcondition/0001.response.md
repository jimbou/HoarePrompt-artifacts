To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `low <= high`. Given the initial states:

- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9
- `low` is 0
- `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`
- `max_profit` is 0

The loop condition depends on `low` and `high`. Since `low` is 0, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, `high` must be greater than or equal to 0. Given that `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, and both `n` and `b` are already constrained to be greater than or equal to 1, `high` will always be greater than or equal to 1, satisfying the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, or `max_profit` to ensure the loop can execute the first time, as the constraints already provided guarantee that `low <= high` will be true.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `low` is 0, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, and `max_profit` is 0**
