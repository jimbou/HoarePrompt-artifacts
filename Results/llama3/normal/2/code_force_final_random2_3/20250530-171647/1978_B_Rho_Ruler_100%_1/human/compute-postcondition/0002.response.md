Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, low is 0, high is the minimum of n and b, mid is the average of low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), and max_profit is the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `low` remains 0, and the value of `high` remains the minimum of `n` and `b`, as these values are not updated by the code. The value of `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`, which is `(0 + min(n, b)) // 2`. The values of `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are calculated by calling the function `func_1` with the arguments `mid`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, and `mid + 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, respectively. Finally, the value of `max_profit` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`.
