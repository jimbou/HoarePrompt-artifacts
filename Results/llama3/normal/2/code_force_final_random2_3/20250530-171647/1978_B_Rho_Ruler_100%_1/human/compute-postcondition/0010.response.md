Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `low` is the integer average of the original `low` and `high` plus 1, `mid` is the integer average of the original `low` and `high`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`, and `low` is greater than `mid`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged. The value of `low` is updated to be the integer average of the original `low` and `high` plus 1, which is greater than `mid`. The relationship between `low` and `high` is no longer specified, as `low` is now greater than `mid`.
