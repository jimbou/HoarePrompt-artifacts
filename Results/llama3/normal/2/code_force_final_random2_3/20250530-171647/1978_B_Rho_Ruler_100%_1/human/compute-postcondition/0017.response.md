Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, mid is the integer average of low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid. If profit_next is greater than profit_mid, then low is set to mid + 1. Otherwise, low is set to less than mid - 1 and high is set to greater than or equal to mid - 1.***
