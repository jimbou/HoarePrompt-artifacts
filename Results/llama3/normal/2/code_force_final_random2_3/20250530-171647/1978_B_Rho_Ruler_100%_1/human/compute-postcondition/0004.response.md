Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `low` is the average of the original low and high plus 1, `high` is the minimum of n and b, `mid` is the average of the original low and high, `profit_mid` is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), `profit_next` is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), and `max_profit` is the maximum of the original max_profit and profit_mid. The current value of profit_next is higher than the current value of profit_mid.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `low` has been updated to be one more than the average of its original value and `high`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `profit_next` and `profit_mid` is still maintained, with `profit_next` being higher than `profit_mid`.
