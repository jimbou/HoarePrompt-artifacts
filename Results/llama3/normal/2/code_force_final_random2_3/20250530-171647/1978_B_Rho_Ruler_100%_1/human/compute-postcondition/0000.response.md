Output State: **n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9, low is 0, high is the minimum of n and b, and max_profit is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The code introduced three new variables: `low`, `high`, and `max_profit`. The value of `low` is set to 0. The value of `high` is set to the minimum of `n` and `b`, which means it will be the smaller of the two values. The value of `max_profit` is set to 0.
