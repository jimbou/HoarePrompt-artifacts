Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `mid` is the integer average of `low` and `high`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is the integer average of the original `low` and `high` plus 1 and `low` is greater than `mid`. Otherwise, `high` is `mid - 1` and `low` is less than `mid - 1`.***
