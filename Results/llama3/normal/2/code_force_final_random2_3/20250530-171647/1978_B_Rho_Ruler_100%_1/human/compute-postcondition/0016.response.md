Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, mid is the integer average of low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid, low is either the integer average of the original low and high plus 1 (if profit_next is greater than profit_mid) or less than mid - 1 (if profit_next is not greater than profit_mid), high is greater than or equal to mid - 1.**

In this output state, the value of high has been updated to be greater than or equal to mid - 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The relationship between low and mid is still maintained, with low being either the integer average of the original low and high plus 1 (if profit_next is greater than profit_mid) or less than mid - 1 (if profit_next is not greater than profit_mid).
