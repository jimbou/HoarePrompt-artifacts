#State of the program right berfore the function call: k, n, a, and b are integers such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), n > 0, a > 0, and b > 0.
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
    #The program returns a value that is a combination of the product of k and b, the difference between the product of k and k-1 divided by 2, and the product of n-k and a, where k is an integer between 0 and the minimum of n and b, n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, and b is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates a value based on the input parameters k, n, a, and b, where k is an integer between 0 and the minimum of n and b, and n, a, and b are positive integers. The function returns a combination of the product of k and b, the difference between the product of k and k-1 divided by 2, and the product of n-k and a.

    #The program returns the maximum profit that can be obtained from the given values of n, a, and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the maximum profit that can be obtained from the given values of n, a, and b, which are integers between 1 and 10^9. It performs a binary search to find the optimal value of mid that maximizes the profit, and returns this maximum profit. The function does not modify the input values n, a, and b.
