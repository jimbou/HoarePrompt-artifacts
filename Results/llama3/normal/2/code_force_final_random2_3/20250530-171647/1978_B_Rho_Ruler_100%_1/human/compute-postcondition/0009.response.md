Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, low is less than or equal to high, mid is the integer average of low and high, profit_mid is the result of func_1(mid, n, a, b), profit_next is the result of func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b), max_profit is the maximum of its original value and profit_mid.**

The code calculates the midpoint `mid` between `low` and `high` and assigns it to `mid`. It then computes the results of `func_1` for both `mid` and `mid + 1`, assigning them to `profit_mid` and `profit_next`, respectively. Finally, it updates `max_profit` to be the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`.
