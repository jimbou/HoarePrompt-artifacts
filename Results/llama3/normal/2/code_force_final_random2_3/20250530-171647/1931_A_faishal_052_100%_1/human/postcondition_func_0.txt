This function reads a series of integers from standard input, converts each integer into a three-character string using a specific encoding scheme, and prints the resulting strings. The function takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the encoded strings to the console. The encoding scheme involves subtracting 96 from each integer to obtain an ASCII value, and then converting the ASCII value to a character. The function processes each integer in the input sequence independently, and the output strings are printed in the order they are processed.
