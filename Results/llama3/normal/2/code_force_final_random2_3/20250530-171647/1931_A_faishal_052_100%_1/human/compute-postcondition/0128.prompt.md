Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is 0, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers in stdin, i is equal to the original value of cases, j is 0, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    temp = ''
    for j in range(3):
        temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
    print(temp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers, `j` is 3, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `temp` is a string containing three characters where each character is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96`, stdin contains no input, `range(3)` is 0, and the string `temp` containing three characters where each character is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers, `j` is 3, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `temp` is a string containing three characters where each character is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96`, stdin contains no input, and the string `temp` containing three characters where each character is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers, `j` is 3, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `temp` is a string containing three characters with ASCII values equal to `info[2][0] + 96`, `info[2][1] + 96`, and `info[2][2] + 96` respectively, stdin contains no input, and nothing is being printed, and this is printed: a string containing three characters with ASCII values equal to `info[2][0] + 96`, `info[2][1] + 96`, and `info[2][2] + 96` respectively




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
