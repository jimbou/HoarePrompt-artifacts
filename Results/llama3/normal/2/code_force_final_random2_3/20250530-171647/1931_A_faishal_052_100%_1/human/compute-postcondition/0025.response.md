Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, j is 2, lex is an integer between -50 and 51, arr contains the integer 1 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 if lex was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26 and 26 and 26.**

In this output state, the value of `lex` has been reduced by 26, and the list `arr` has been appended with the integer 26. The other variables remain unchanged.
