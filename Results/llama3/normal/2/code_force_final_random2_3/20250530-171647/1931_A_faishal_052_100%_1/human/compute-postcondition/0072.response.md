Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is less than 2, arr is a list containing the integer 26, lex is an integer between 26 and 52, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer**

In this output state, the value of `lex` has been updated to be between 26 and 52, as it was originally between 52 and 78 and was decremented by 26. The list `arr` now contains the integer 26, which was appended in the first line of the code. All other variables remain unchanged.
