Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t integers (3 <= n <= 78)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    arr = []
    lex = int(input())
    for j in range(2):
        if lex < 28:
            arr.append(1)
            lex = lex - 1
        elif lex < 52:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
        elif lex <= 78:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
    arr.append(lex)
    arr.sort()
    info.append(arr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 0, j is 2, arr contains the integer 1 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 if lex was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26, 26, and 26 if lex is less than 52, otherwise it contains the integers 26 and 26, lex is an integer between -25 and 76 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise it is an integer between -50 and 51 if lex is less than 52, otherwise it is an integer between -24 and 77, stdin contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 1, j is 2, arr is a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, lex is an integer between -128 and 73.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is 0, stdin contains no input, arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 1 and lex if lex is less than 28, or a list containing the integer 26 and lex if lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than or equal to 78, or an empty list if lex is greater than 78, lex is an integer between -130 and 25 if lex is less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
