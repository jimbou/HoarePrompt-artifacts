Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is 0, stdin contains no input, arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 1 and lex if lex is less than 28, or a list containing the integer 26 and lex if lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than or equal to 78, or an empty list if lex is greater than 78, lex is an integer between -130 and 25 if lex is less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78.**

In this output state, the value of `cases` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `info` is updated to include a new sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex. The value of `i` and `j` also remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `arr` is updated to include the integer lex and is sorted in ascending order. The value of `lex` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `stdin` remains empty as it contains no input.
