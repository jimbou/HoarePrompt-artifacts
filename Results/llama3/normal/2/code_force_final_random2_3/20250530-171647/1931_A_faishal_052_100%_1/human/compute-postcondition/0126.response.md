The code prints the value of `temp`, which is a string containing three characters. The ASCII values of these characters are calculated based on the values in the `info` list.

Specifically, the first character's ASCII value is `info[2][0] + 96`, the second character's ASCII value is `info[2][1] + 96`, and the third character's ASCII value is `info[2][2] + 96`.

Since `info` is a list of sorted lists of integers, and `j` is 3, we know that `info[2]` is a sorted list of integers. However, the exact values of these integers are not specified.

Therefore, we can't determine the exact ASCII values of the characters in the `temp` string. But we can describe the output as a string containing three characters, where each character's ASCII value is calculated based on the values in the `info` list.

Output: **a string containing three characters with ASCII values equal to info[2][0] + 96, info[2][1] + 96, and info[2][2] + 96 respectively**
