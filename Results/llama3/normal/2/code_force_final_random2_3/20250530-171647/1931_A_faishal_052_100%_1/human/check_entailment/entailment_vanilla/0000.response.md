Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The program works by iterating through each test case, and for each test case, it attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest word by subtracting the smallest possible values from the encoded integer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and stores it in the variable `cases`.
2. For each test case, the program reads the encoded integer and stores it in the variable `lex`.
3. The program then enters a loop that runs twice, during which it attempts to subtract the smallest possible values from `lex`. The smallest possible values are 1 and 26, which correspond to the letters 'a' and 'z' respectively.
4. If `lex` is less than 28, the program appends 1 to the array `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This corresponds to the letter 'a'.
5. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 but less than 52, the program appends 26 to the array `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This corresponds to the letter 'z'.
6. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52 but less than or equal to 78, the program appends 26 to the array `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This again corresponds to the letter 'z'.
7. After the loop, the program appends the remaining value of `lex` to the array `arr`.
8. The program then sorts the array `arr` in ascending order.
9. Finally, the program constructs the lexicographically smallest word by converting each value in `arr` to its corresponding letter using the `chr` function and concatenating the letters together.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
