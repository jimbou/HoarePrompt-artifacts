Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 2, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between -25 and 76 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise it is an integer between -50 and 51 if lex is less than 52, otherwise it is an integer between -24 and 77, stdin contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78)
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is less than 2, `arr` is a list containing 1 if `lex` is less than 28, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` is less than or equal to 78, otherwise `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -26 and 75 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -76 and 25 if `lex` was originally less than 52, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -24 and 77, and stdin contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` is a list containing 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` was originally less than or equal to 78, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 and 26, and `lex` is an integer between -27 and 74 if `lex` was originally less than 28 and lex is less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -77 and 24 if `lex` was originally less than 52 and lex is less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -25 and 76 if `lex` was originally less than 52 and lex is less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -52 and -1 if `lex` was originally less than 28 and lex is not less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -102 and -51 if `lex` was originally less than 52 and lex is not less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -50 and 51 if `lex` was originally less than 52 and lex is not less than 28, and stdin contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is a list containing 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` was originally less than or equal to 78, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 and 26. If `lex` was originally less than 28, then `lex` is an integer between -28 and 73 if `lex` is less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -53 and -2. If `lex` was originally less than 52, then `lex` is an integer between -78 and 23 if `lex` is less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -103 and -52 if `lex` is not less than 28. If `lex` was originally less than 52 and `lex` is not less than 28, then `lex` is an integer between -51 and 50 if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -76 and 25. If `lex` was originally less than 52 and `lex` is not less than 28, then `lex` is an integer between -78 and -27 if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -128 and -53 if `lex` is not less than 52. If `lex` was originally less than 52 and `lex` is not less than 28, then `lex` is an integer between -126 and -49 if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -128 and -77 if `lex` is not less than 52. If `lex` was originally less than 52 and `lex` is not less than 28, then `lex` is an integer between -76 and 25 if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -128 and -77 if `lex` is not less than 52. Otherwise, the state of `lex` remains unchanged. stdin contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
