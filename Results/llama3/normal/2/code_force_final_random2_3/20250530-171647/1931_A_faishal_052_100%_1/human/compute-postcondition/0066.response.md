Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is less than 2, arr is a list containing the integer 1, lex is an integer between -129 and 26, stdin contains no input.**

The code snippet modifies the initial state in the following ways:

*   The first line appends the integer 1 to the list `arr`, which was initially empty. This results in `arr` containing the single element 1.
*   The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1. Since `lex` was initially an integer between -128 and 27, its new value will be between -129 and 26.

All other variables (`cases`, `info`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet. The `stdin` is also not affected by the code snippet, so it remains with no input.
