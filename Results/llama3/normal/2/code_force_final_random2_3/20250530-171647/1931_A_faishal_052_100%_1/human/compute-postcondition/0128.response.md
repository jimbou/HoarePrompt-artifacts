Output State: **`cases` is 0, `i` is equal to the original value of cases, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers, `j` is 3, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `temp` is a string containing three characters with ASCII values equal to `info[i-1][0] + 96`, `info[i-1][1] + 96`, and `info[i-1][2] + 96` respectively, stdin contains no input, and nothing is being printed, and this is printed: a string containing three characters with ASCII values equal to `info[i-1][0] + 96`, `info[i-1][1] + 96`, and `info[i-1][2] + 96` respectively.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is as follows:

*   The variable `cases` is reset to 0.
*   The variable `i` is equal to the original value of cases.
*   The variable `info` remains unchanged, containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers.
*   The variable `j` is 3.
*   The variable `arr` is an empty list.
*   The variable `lex` remains unchanged, with its value depending on the original value of lex.
*   The variable `temp` contains a string with three characters, where each character is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i-1][j] + 96`.
*   The stdin contains no input.
*   Nothing is being printed.
*   A string containing three characters with ASCII values equal to `info[i-1][0] + 96`, `info[i-1][1] + 96`, and `info[i-1][2] + 96` respectively is printed.
