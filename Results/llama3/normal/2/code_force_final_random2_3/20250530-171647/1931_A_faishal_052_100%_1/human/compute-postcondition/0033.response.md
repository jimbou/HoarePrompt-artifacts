Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 2, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between -25 and 76 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise it is an integer between -50 and 51 if lex is less than 52, otherwise it is an integer between -24 and 77, stdin contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78)**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns an empty list to the variable `arr`, effectively resetting its value. The second line reads an integer from `stdin` and assigns it to the variable `lex`. Since `lex` was originally an integer between -25 and 76 if it was less than 28, otherwise between -50 and 51 if it was less than 52, otherwise between -24 and 77, its new value will be an integer within the same range. The value of `lex` is updated based on the input from `stdin`, which now contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78). The other variables, `cases`, `info`, `i`, and `j`, remain unchanged.
