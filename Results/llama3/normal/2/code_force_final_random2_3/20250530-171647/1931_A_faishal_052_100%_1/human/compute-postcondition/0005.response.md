The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 1 to the list `arr`, making it non-empty. The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1.

Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is a list containing the integer 1, lex is an integer between 2 and 26, j is either 0 or 1**
