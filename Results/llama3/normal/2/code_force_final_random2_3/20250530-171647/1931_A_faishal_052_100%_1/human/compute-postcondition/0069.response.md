The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, making `arr` equal to [26]. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, making `lex` equal to its original value minus 26. Since `lex` is an integer between 28 and 51, the new value of `lex` will be between 2 and 25.

Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is less than 2, arr is [26], lex is an integer between 2 and 25, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer**
