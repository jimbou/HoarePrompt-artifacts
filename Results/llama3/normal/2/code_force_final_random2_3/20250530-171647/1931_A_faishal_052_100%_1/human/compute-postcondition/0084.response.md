The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.

State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains no input. If lex is less than 28, arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 1, and lex is an integer between -130 and 25. If lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 2 and 25. If lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 26 and 52. If lex is greater than 78, arr is an empty list. If lex is greater than or equal to 28, cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains no input. If lex is less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -103 and 0. If lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than 26, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between -24 and 0. If lex is greater than or equal to 26 and less than or equal to 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 0 and 26. If lex is greater than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between -26 and 52. If lex is greater than 78, arr is an empty list.**
