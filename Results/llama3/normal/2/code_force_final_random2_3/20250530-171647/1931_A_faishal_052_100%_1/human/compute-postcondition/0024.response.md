Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, j is 2, lex is an integer between -50 and 51, arr contains the integer 1 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 if lex was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26, 26, and 26.**

The code snippet modifies the `arr` list and the `lex` variable. The first line appends the integer 26 to the `arr` list, and the second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. The other variables remain unchanged. The final state includes the updated values of `arr` and `lex`, while the other variables retain their original values.
