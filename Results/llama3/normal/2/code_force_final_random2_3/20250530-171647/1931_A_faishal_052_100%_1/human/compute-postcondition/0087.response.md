Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains no input, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex, and lex is an integer between -26 and 52.**

The code modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   The first line appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`. This means that `arr` now contains the integer 26 and lex.
*   The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. This means that `lex` is now an integer between -26 and 52.

All other variables remain unchanged. The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, and updates the values of `arr` and `lex` that are modified by the code.
