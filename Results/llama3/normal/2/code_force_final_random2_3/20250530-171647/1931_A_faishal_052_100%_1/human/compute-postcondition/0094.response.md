According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cases` is 0, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `cases` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is also in the loop head, and its initial value should be 0, which is the first index in the range.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers in stdin, `j` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, stdin contains no input**
