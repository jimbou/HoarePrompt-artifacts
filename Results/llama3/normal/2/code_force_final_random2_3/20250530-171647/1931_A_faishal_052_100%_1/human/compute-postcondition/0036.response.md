Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is less than 2, arr is a list containing 1, lex is an integer between -26 and 75, stdin contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78)**

The code block modifies the values of `arr` and `lex`. The first line appends the value 1 to the list `arr`, which was initially empty. The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1. Since the current value of `lex` is less than 28, the new value of `lex` will be between -26 and 75. All other variables remain unchanged.
