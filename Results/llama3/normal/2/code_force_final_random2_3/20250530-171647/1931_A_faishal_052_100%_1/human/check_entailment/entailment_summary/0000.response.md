Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The program reads a series of integers from standard input, converts each integer into a three-character string using a specific encoding scheme, and prints the resulting strings.

The program's logic is as follows:

1.  It first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` and initializes an empty list `arr`.
3.  It then enters a loop that runs twice, and in each iteration, it checks the value of `lex` and appends a value to `arr` based on the following conditions:

    *   If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
    *   If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
    *   If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
4.  After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
5.  It then sorts `arr` in ascending order.
6.  Finally, it converts each value in `arr` to a character by adding 96 to it (since the ASCII value of 'a' is 97) and prints the resulting string.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
