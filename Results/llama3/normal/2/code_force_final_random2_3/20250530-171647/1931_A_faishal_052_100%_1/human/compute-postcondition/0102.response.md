Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers, `j` is 3, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `temp` is a string containing three characters where each character is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96`, stdin contains no input, `range(3)` is 0**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the variable `j` has reached the value 3, which is outside the range of the loop. The string `temp` now contains three characters, each of which is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96` for `j` equal to 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
