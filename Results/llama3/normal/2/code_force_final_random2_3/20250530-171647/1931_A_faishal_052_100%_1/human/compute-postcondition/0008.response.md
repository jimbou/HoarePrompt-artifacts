The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, and the second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`.

Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is a list containing the integer 26, lex is an integer between 2 and 25, j is either 0 or 1**
