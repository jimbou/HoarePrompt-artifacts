Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr contains the integer 1 if lex is less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 if lex is between 28 and 51, otherwise it is an empty list, lex is an integer between 1 and 77, j is 1**

The code block modifies the state of the variables `arr` and `lex`. The first line appends the integer 1 to the list `arr`, regardless of its initial value. The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1. 

The initial value of `lex` is between 2 and 78, so after decrementing, it will be between 1 and 77. The value of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`, but since `lex` has been decremented, the condition for `arr` might change. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `arr` will now contain two 1s. If `lex` was between 28 and 51, `arr` will now contain the integer 26 and the integer 1. If `lex` was greater than 51, `arr` will now contain the integer 1.

No other variables are affected by the code block. The values of `cases`, `info`, `stdin`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
