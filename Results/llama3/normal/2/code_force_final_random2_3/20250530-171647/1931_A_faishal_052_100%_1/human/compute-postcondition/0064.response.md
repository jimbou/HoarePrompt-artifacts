To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and the range `2`.

Since the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `2`, we can adjust the state of `j` to be less than `2`. 

State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is less than 2, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between -128 and 73, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer**
