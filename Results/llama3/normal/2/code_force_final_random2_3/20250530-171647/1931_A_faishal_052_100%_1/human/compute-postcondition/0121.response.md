According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than 3. So for the loop to be executed one more time `j` must be increased by 1 and must be less than 3.
State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers, `j` is less than 3 and greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `temp` is a string containing a single character with ASCII value equal to `info[2][j] + 96`, stdin contains no input, and nothing is being printed.**
