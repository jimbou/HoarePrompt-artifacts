Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `lex` is less than 52, `lex` is an integer between -50 and 51, and `arr` contains the integer 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 if `lex` was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26, 26, and 26. If `lex` is 52 or more, `lex` is an integer between -24 and 77, and `arr` contains the integer 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 if `lex` was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26 and 26.***
