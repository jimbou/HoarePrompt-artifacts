To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and the range `2`.

Since the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `2`, we can adjust the state of `j` to be within this range. Specifically, `j` should be either `0` or `1` for the loop to execute.

The state of the other variables (`cases`, `info`, `stdin`, `i`, `arr`, and `lex`) does not affect the execution of the loop, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between 3 and 78, `j` is either 0 or 1**
