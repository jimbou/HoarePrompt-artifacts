Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers, `j` is 3, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `temp` is a string containing three characters where each character is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96`, stdin contains no input, and the string `temp` containing three characters where each character is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96` is no longer being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only changes being in the variables `j` and `temp`. The value of `j` has increased to 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `temp` is now a string containing three characters, each representing the ASCII character corresponding to the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96` for `j` equal to 0, 1, and 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
