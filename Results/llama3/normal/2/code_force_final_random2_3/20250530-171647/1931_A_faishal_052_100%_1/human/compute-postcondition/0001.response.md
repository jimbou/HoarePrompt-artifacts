According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect that it will start from 0.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t integers (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0**
