Output State: **cases is 0, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers in stdin, i is equal to the original value of cases, j is 0, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `cases` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The `info` list will contain a sorted list of integers for each of the original `t` integers in `stdin`. The value of `i` will be equal to the original value of `cases`, and `j` will be 0. The `arr` list will be empty, and the value of `lex` will depend on its original value. If the original value of `lex` was less than 28, it will be an integer between -130 and 25. If the original value of `lex` was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, it will be an integer between 2 and 25. If the original value of `lex` was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, it will be an integer between 26 and 52. Finally, `stdin` will contain no input, indicating that all input has been processed.
