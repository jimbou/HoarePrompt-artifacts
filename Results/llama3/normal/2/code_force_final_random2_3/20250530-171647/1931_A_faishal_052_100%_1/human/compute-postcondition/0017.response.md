Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is a list containing the integer 1 if lex is less than 28, otherwise it is a list containing the integer 26 if lex is between 28 and 51, otherwise it is a list containing the integers 26 and 26, lex is an integer between -24 and 52, j is 1**

The code block modifies the state of the variables `arr` and `lex`. The first line appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`, and the second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. The other variables remain unchanged.
