Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is less than 2, `arr` is a list containing 1 if `lex` is less than 28, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` is less than or equal to 78, otherwise `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -26 and 75 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -76 and 25 if `lex` was originally less than 52, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -24 and 77, and stdin contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78).***
