Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is a list containing 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` was originally less than or equal to 78, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 and 26. If `lex` was originally less than 28, then `lex` is an integer between -28 and 73 if `lex` is less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -53 and -2. If `lex` was originally less than 52, then `lex` is an integer between -78 and 23 if `lex` is less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -103 and -52 if `lex` is not less than 28. If `lex` was originally less than 52 and `lex` is not less than 28, then `lex` is an integer between -51 and 50 if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -76 and 25. If `lex` was originally less than 52 and `lex` is not less than 28, then `lex` is an integer between -78 and -27 if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -128 and -53 if `lex` is not less than 52. If `lex` was originally less than 52 and `lex` is not less than 28, then `lex` is an integer between -126 and -49 if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -128 and -77 if `lex` is not less than 52. If `lex` was originally less than 52 and `lex` is not less than 28, then `lex` is an integer between -76 and 25 if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -128 and -77 if `lex` is not less than 52. Otherwise, the state of `lex` remains unchanged. stdin contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `cases` remains unchanged, within the range of 1 to 100.
* The value of `info` remains unchanged, containing a sorted list of integers.
* The value of `i` remains unchanged, equal to 1.
* The value of `j` is now 2, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
* The value of `arr` depends on the original value of `lex`. If `lex` was originally less than 28, `arr` contains the integer 1. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 78, `arr` contains the integer 26. Otherwise, `arr` contains the integer 26 and 26.
* The value of `lex` depends on its original value and whether it is less than 28 or not. If `lex` was originally less than 28, it is now an integer between -28 and 73 if it is less than 28, otherwise it is an integer between -53 and -2. If `lex` was originally less than 52, it is now an integer between -78 and 23 if it is less than 28, otherwise it is an integer between -103 and -52 if it is not less than 28. If `lex` was originally less than 52 and is not less than 28, it is now an integer between -51 and 50 if it is less than 52, otherwise it is an integer between -76 and 25. If `lex` was originally less than 52 and is not less than 28, it is now an integer between -78 and -27 if it is less than 52, otherwise it is an integer between -128 and -53 if it is not less than 52. If `lex` was originally less than 52 and is not less than 28, it is now an integer between -126 and -49 if it is less than 52, otherwise it is an integer between -128 and -77 if it is not less than 52. If `lex` was originally less than 52 and is not less than 28, it is now an integer between -76 and 25 if it is less than 52, otherwise it is an integer between -128 and -77 if it is not less than 52. Otherwise, the state of `lex` remains unchanged.
* The value of stdin remains unchanged, containing t-2 integers within the range of 3 to 78.
