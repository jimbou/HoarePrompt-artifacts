Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` is a list containing 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` was originally less than or equal to 78, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 and 26, and `lex` is an integer between -52 and -1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -102 and -51 if `lex` was originally less than 52, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -50 and 51, and stdin contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78).**
