Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 55, the program outputs "czz", but the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is actually "azz". 

The issue with the program is that it always tries to subtract 26 from the input number, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach is to find the smallest possible combination of three letters that sum up to the input number.

For example, when the input is 55, the program should output "azz" because 'a' has an index of 1, 'z' has an index of 26, and 'z' has an index of 26, and 1 + 26 + 26 = 53, which is not equal to 55. But 'a' has an index of 1, 'a' has an index of 1, and 'z' has an index of 26 + 26 + 1 + 1 = 54, and 'a' has an index of 1, 'a' has an index of 1, and 'z' has an index of 26 + 26 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 55.
