Postcondition: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is 1, stdin contains no input. If lex is less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -103 and 0. If lex is greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between -24 and 0. If lex is greater than or equal to 26 and less than or equal to 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 0 and 26. If lex is greater than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between -26 and 52. If lex is greater than 78, arr is an empty list.**
