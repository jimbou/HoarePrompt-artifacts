The code block consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, and the second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. 

The initial state of `arr` is an empty list, so after the first line, `arr` will contain the single element 26. The initial value of `lex` is between -24 and 78, so after the second line, `lex` will be between -50 and 52.

The other variables in the initial state (`cases`, `info`, `i`, `j`, and stdin) are not affected by the code block.

Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is less than 2, arr is a list containing the single element 26, lex is an integer between -50 and 52, and stdin contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78).**
