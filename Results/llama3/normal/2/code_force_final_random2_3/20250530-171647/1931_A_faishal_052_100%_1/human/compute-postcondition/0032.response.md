To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cases`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `cases`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `cases` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` contains the integer 1 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 if lex was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26, 26, and 26 if lex is less than 52, otherwise it contains the integers 26 and 26, `lex` is an integer between -25 and 76 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise it is an integer between -50 and 51 if lex is less than 52, otherwise it is an integer between -24 and 77, `stdin` contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78)**
