Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 1, j is 2, arr is a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, lex is an integer between -128 and 73.**

The code appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`, then sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The sorted list `arr` is then appended to the list `info`. The value of `lex` is an integer between -128 and 73, and the list `arr` is a sorted list containing the integer 26 and `lex`. The other variables `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The state of `lex` is updated to be an integer between -128 and 73.
