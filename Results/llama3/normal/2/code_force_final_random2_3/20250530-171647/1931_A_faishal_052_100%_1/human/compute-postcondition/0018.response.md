Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers, i is 0, arr contains the integer 1 and the integer 26 if lex was less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 and the integer 26 if lex was between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integer 26, lex is an integer between -24 and 52, j is 1**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `cases` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 100. The `info` list remains empty. The `stdin` still contains t-1 integers. The value of `i` remains 0. The `arr` list now contains the integer 1 and the integer 26 if `lex` was less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 and the integer 26 if `lex` was between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integer 26. The value of `lex` has been decremented by 26, so it is now an integer between -24 and 52. The value of `j` remains 1.
