Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains no input, arr is a list containing the integers 1, 1, and 1 if lex is less than 28, or a list containing the integers 26, lex, and 1 if lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or a list containing the integers 26 and 1 if lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, or an empty list if lex is greater than 78, and lex is an integer between -131 and 24 if lex is less than 28, or an integer between 1 and 24 if lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 25 and 51 if lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, or an integer between -1 and 77 if lex is greater than 78.**

The code modifies the `arr` list and the `lex` variable. The first line appends the integer 1 to the `arr` list, and the second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1. The final state of `arr` and `lex` depends on the initial value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` becomes a list containing the integers 1, 1, and 1, and `lex` becomes an integer between -131 and 24. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `arr` becomes a list containing the integers 26, `lex`, and 1, and `lex` becomes an integer between 1 and 24. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` becomes a list containing the integers 26 and 1, and `lex` becomes an integer between 25 and 51. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` becomes an empty list, and `lex` becomes an integer between -1 and 77. The other variables, `cases`, `info`, `i`, and `j`, remain unchanged.
