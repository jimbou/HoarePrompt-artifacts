Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers, `j` is less than 3 and greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `temp` is a string containing two characters with ASCII values equal to `info[2][j] + 96` and `info[2][j] + 96` respectively, stdin contains no input, and nothing is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated to include an additional character with an ASCII value equal to `info[2][j] + 96`, which is the same as the original ASCII value of `temp`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
