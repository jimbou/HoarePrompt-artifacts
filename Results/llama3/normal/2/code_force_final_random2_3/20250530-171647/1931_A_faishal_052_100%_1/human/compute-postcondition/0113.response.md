Output State: `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers, `j` is 3, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `temp` is a string containing six characters where the first five characters are the ASCII characters represented by the integer values of `info[i][j] + 96` and the sixth character is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96`, stdin contains no input.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `j` has reached its final value of 3, and the string `temp` now contains six characters, where the first five characters are the ASCII characters represented by the integer values of `info[i][j] + 96` and the sixth character is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96`. The other variables remain unchanged.
