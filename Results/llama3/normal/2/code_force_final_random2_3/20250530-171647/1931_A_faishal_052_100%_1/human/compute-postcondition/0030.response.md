Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, j is 2. If lex is less than 28, lex is an integer between -25 and 76, and arr contains the integer 1 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integers 26 and 1 if lex was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26, 26 and 1. If lex is 28 or more, lex is an integer between -50 and 51 if lex is less than 52, otherwise lex is an integer between -24 and 77. If lex is less than 52, arr contains the integer 1 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 if lex was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26, 26, and 26. If lex is 52 or more, arr contains the integer 1 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 if lex was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26 and 26.**

This output state indicates that after the loop executes all its iterations, the values of `cases`, `info`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is 2, indicating that the loop has completed its two iterations. The value of `lex` and the contents of `arr` depend on the original value of `lex`. If `lex` was originally less than 28, it will be between -25 and 76, and `arr` will contain the integer 1. If `lex` was originally between 28 and 51, it will be between -50 and 51, and `arr` will contain the integer 26. If `lex` was originally 52 or more, it will be between -24 and 77, and `arr` will contain the integers 26 and 26.
