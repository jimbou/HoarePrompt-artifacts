Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `lex` is an integer between -24 and 52, `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` is a list containing the integer 1 if `lex` is less than 28, otherwise it is a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` is between 28 and 51, otherwise it is a list containing the integers 26 and 26. If `lex` is 52 or larger, if `lex` was originally less than 28, `arr` contains the integers 1 and 26. If `lex` was originally between 28 and 51, `arr` contains the integers 26 and 26. If `lex` was originally larger than 51, `arr` contains the integer 26.***
