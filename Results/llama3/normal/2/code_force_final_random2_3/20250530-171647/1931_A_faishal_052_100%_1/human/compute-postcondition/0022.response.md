The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `lex` is an integer between -24 and 77, `arr` contains the integer 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 if `lex` was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26 and 26**
