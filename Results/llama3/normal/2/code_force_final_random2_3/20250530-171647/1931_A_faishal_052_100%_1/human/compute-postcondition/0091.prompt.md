Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is 2, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between -128 and 73, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is less than 2. If lex < 28, arr is a list containing the integer 1 and lex is an integer between -129 and 26, stdin contains no input. If lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 2 and 25. If lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 26 and 52. If lex is greater than 78, arr is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is 1, stdin contains no input. If lex is less than 28, arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 1, and lex is an integer between -130 and 25. If lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 2 and 25. If lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 26 and 52. If lex is greater than 78, arr is an empty list. If lex is greater than or equal to 28, cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is 1, stdin contains no input. If lex is less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 1 and 26, and lex is an integer between -103 and 0. If lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than 26, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between -24 and 0. If lex is greater than or equal to 26 and less than or equal to 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 0 and 26. If lex is greater than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between -26 and 52. If lex is greater than 78, arr is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is 2, stdin contains no input. If lex is less than 28, arr is a list containing the integers 1, 1, and 1, and lex is an integer between -131 and 24. If lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, arr is a list containing the integers 26, lex, and 1, and lex is an integer between 1 and 24. If lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, arr is a list containing the integers 26 and 1, and lex is an integer between 25 and 51. If lex is greater than 78, arr is an empty list, and lex is an integer between -1 and 77.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
