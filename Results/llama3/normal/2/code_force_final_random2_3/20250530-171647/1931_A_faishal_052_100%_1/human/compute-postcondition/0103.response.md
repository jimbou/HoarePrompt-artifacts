The code prints the string `temp` which contains three characters. Each character in the string is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, we are looking at the fourth element of the first list in `info`. However, the exact value of `info[0][3]` is not provided, so we can't determine the exact characters in the string. But we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **A string of three characters where each character is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of the fourth element of the first list in `info` plus 96**
