To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variable `j` in the loop head.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 2.

The other variables in the state, such as `cases`, `i`, `info`, `arr`, `lex`, `temp`, and `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers, `j` is 2, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `temp` is a string containing two characters where the first character is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96` and the second character is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96`, stdin contains no input, `range(3)` is greater than 0**
