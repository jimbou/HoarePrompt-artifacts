Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers, `j` is 3, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `temp` is a string containing three characters with ASCII values equal to `info[2][0] + 96`, `info[2][1] + 96`, and `info[2][2] + 96` respectively, stdin contains no input, and nothing is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that all variables remain unchanged except for `temp`, which now contains a string of three characters. Each character in the string has an ASCII value equal to the corresponding element in the list `info[2]` plus 96. The loop has finished executing, and the program has moved on to the next statement.
