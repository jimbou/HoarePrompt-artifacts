The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is a list containing 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` was originally less than or equal to 78, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 and 26, and `lex` is an integer between -27 and 74 if `lex` was originally less than 28 and lex is less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -77 and 24 if `lex` was originally less than 52 and lex is less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -25 and 76 if `lex` was originally less than 52 and lex is less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -52 and -1 if `lex` was originally less than 28 and lex is not less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -102 and -51 if `lex` was originally less than 52 and lex is not less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -50 and 51 if `lex` was originally less than 52 and lex is not less than 28, and stdin contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78)**
