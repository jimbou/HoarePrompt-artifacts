Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is 0, stdin contains no input. If lex is less than 28, arr is a list containing the integers 1 and 1, and lex is an integer between -130 and 25. If lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 2 and 25. If lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 26 and 52. If lex is greater than 78, arr is an empty list.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the values of the variables have been updated accordingly. The loop counter `j` has reached 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `lex` has been updated based on the conditions in the loop body, and the list `arr` has been populated with the appropriate values. The other variables, `cases`, `info`, `i`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
