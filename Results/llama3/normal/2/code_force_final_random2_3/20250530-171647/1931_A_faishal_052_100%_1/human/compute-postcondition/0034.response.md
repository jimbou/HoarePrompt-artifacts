According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 2, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than 2.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is less than 2, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -25 and 76 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise it is an integer between -50 and 51 if lex is less than 52, otherwise it is an integer between -24 and 77, stdin contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78)**
