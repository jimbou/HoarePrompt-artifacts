Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between 3 and 78.**

In this output state, the value of `lex` is an integer between 3 and 78, which is the input value read from `stdin`. The number of integers in `stdin` has decreased by 1, as one integer has been read and assigned to `lex`. The other variables, `cases`, `info`, and `i`, remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
