Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, j is 2, lex is an integer between -25 and 76, arr contains the integer 1 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integers 26 and 1 if lex was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26, 26 and 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the integer 1 to the list `arr`. The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1. 

The initial state of `arr` depends on the original value of `lex`. If `lex` was originally less than 28, `arr` contains the integer 1. If `lex` was originally between 28 and 51, `arr` contains the integer 26. If `lex` was originally greater than 51, `arr` contains the integers 26 and 26. After the first line of code is executed, the integer 1 is appended to `arr`. 

The second line of code decrements the value of `lex` by 1. Since `lex` was originally an integer between -24 and 77, after the decrement operation, `lex` becomes an integer between -25 and 76. 

The other variables in the initial state, `cases`, `info`, `stdin`, `i`, and `j`, are not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same in the output state.
