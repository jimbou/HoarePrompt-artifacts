Postcondition: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is a list containing 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` was originally less than or equal to 78, otherwise `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 and 26 and then 26. If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, `lex` is an integer between -53 and 50 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -103 and -25 if `lex` was originally less than 52 and `lex` is less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -51 and 50 if `lex` was originally less than 52 and `lex` is less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -78 and -27 if `lex` was originally less than 28 and `lex` is not less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -128 and -77 if `lex` was originally less than 52 and `lex` is not less than 28, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -76 and 25 if `lex` was originally less than 52 and `lex` is not less than 28. Otherwise, the state of `lex` remains unchanged. stdin contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78).**
