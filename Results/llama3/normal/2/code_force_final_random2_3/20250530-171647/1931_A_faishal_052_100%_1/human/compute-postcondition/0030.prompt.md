Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), i is 0, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer between 3 and 78.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the integer 1 if `lex` is less than 28, otherwise it is a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` is between 28 and 51, otherwise it is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between 2 and 78, `j` is either 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is an integer between 1 and 77 and `arr` contains the integer 1. If `lex` is 28 or larger, `lex` is an integer between -24 and 52. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` contains the integer 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 if `lex` was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26 and 26. If `lex` is 52 or larger, if `lex` was originally less than 28, `arr` contains the integers 1 and 26. If `lex` was originally between 28 and 51, `arr` contains the integers 26 and 26. If `lex` was originally larger than 51, `arr` contains the integer 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `info` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 integers (3 <= n <= 78), `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is an integer between -25 and 76, and `arr` contains the integer 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integers 26 and 1 if `lex` was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26, 26 and 1. If `lex` is 28 or more, `lex` is an integer between -50 and 51 if `lex` is less than 52, otherwise `lex` is an integer between -24 and 77. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` contains the integer 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 if `lex` was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26, 26, and 26. If `lex` is 52 or more, `arr` contains the integer 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise it contains the integer 26 if `lex` was originally between 28 and 51, otherwise it contains the integers 26 and 26.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
