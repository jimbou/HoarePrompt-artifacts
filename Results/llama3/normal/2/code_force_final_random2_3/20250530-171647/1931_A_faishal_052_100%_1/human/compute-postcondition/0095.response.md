Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers, `j` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `temp` is an empty string, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `temp` is introduced with an empty string value. The stdin still contains no input.
