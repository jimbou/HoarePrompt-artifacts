Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers, i is 1, j is 1, arr is a list containing 1 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise arr is a list containing the integer 26 if lex was originally less than or equal to 78, otherwise arr is a list containing 26 and 26, and lex is an integer between -52 and -1 if lex was originally less than 28, otherwise lex is an integer between -102 and -51 if lex was originally less than 52, otherwise lex is an integer between -50 and 51, and stdin contains t-2 integers (3 <= n <= 78)**

The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was originally a list containing 1 if `lex` was less than 28, otherwise `arr` was a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` was less than or equal to 78, otherwise `arr` was an empty list, now `arr` will contain 1 and 26 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `arr` will contain 26 and 26 if `lex` was originally less than or equal to 78, otherwise `arr` will contain 26. The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 26. Since `lex` was originally an integer between -26 and 75 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `lex` was an integer between -76 and 25 if `lex` was originally less than 52, otherwise `lex` was an integer between -24 and 77, now `lex` will be an integer between -52 and -1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `lex` will be an integer between -102 and -51 if `lex` was originally less than 52, otherwise `lex` will be an integer between -50 and 51. No other variables are affected.
