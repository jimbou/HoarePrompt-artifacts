Postcondition: ***cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is a list containing a sorted list of integers and a sorted list containing the integer 26 and lex, i is 2, j is less than 2. If lex < 28, arr is a list containing the integer 1 and lex is an integer between -129 and 26, stdin contains no input. If lex is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 2 and 25. If lex is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and lex is an integer between 26 and 52. If lex is greater than 78, arr is an empty list.***
