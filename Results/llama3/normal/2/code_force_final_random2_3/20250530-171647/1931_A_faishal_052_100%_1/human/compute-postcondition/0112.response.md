Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing a sorted list of integers for each of the original t integers, `j` is 2, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer between -130 and 25 if the original value of lex was less than 28, or an integer between 2 and 25 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, or an integer between 26 and 52 if the original value of lex was greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `temp` is a string containing five characters where the first four characters are the ASCII characters represented by the integer values of `info[i][j] + 96` and the fifth character is the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` has been updated by appending the ASCII character represented by the integer value of `info[i][j] + 96` to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.
