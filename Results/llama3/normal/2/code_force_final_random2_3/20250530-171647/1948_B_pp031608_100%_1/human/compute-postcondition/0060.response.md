Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to False if the list of integers formed by the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` is not sorted. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**
