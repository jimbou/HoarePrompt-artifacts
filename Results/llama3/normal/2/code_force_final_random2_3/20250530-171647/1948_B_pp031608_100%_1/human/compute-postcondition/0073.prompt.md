Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True, i is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, m is greater than 1, and _ is 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to False if the list of integers formed by the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` is not sorted. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to its first digit, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether `nums` is sorted in ascending order or not. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to its first digit, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, and if `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr[i - 1]`, `nums`, and `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
