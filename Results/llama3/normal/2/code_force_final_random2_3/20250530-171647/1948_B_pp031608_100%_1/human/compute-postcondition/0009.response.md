Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m - 1`, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to the first digit of the original value of `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If the digits in `nums` are not in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same. The value of `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be the first digit of its original value. The value of `nums` is still a list containing the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The value of `ans` is still False if the digits in `nums` are not in ascending order, otherwise it remains unchanged.
