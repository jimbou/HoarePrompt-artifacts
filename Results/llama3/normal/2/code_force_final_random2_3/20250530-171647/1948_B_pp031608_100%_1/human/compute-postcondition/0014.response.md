Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False. Otherwise, no specific value is assigned to `ans`.***
