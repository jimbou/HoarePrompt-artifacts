Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `nums`, which is a list of integers. The first elements of `nums` are the digits of the integer at index `i - 1` in the list `arr`, and the last element of `nums` is the integer at index `i` in the list `arr`.
