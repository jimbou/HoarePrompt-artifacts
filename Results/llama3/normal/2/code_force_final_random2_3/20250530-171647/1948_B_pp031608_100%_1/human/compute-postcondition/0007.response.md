Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is False, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is m - 1, the current value of arr[i] is less than the current value of arr[i - 1], and nums is a list containing the digits of arr[i - 1] followed by arr[i]. The list nums is not sorted in ascending order.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`, which was initially `True`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `ans` is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
