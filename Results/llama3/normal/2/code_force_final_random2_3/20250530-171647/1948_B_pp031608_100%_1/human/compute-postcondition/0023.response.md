Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True if all elements in arr are in non-decreasing order, or False otherwise, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99)**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `arr` will be in non-decreasing order, and the variable `ans` will be `True` if all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, or `False` otherwise. The values of `n`, `m`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
