Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to its first digit, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether `nums` is sorted in ascending order or not. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
