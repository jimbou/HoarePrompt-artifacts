Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where the value of `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first element of `nums`, `ans` is False, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99). If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, 'NO' is printed, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `m-1`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be equal to the first element of `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases, and the conditions on `m`, `i`, and the relationship between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` are still valid.
