The code prints 'YES' if the list of integers formed by the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order for all `i` from `m - 1` to 1, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Where `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), and `i` is 1.
Output: ** `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the list of integers formed by the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order or not for all `i` from `m - 1` to 1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed**
