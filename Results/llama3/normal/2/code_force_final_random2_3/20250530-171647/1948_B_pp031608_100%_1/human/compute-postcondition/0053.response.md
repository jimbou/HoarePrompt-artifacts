To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than 1. Since `m` is already given to be greater than 1, we only need to adjust the value of `i` to be within the range of the loop. The loop iterates from `m - 1` down to 1, so we can set `i` to be `m - 1` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, `m` is greater than 1, and `_` is 1**
