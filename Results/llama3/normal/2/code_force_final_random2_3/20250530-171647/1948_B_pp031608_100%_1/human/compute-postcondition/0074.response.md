The code prints 'YES' if the list of integers formed by the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order for all `i` from `m - 1` to 1, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
Output: **YES if the list of integers formed by the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order for all `i` from `m - 1` to 1, otherwise NO**
