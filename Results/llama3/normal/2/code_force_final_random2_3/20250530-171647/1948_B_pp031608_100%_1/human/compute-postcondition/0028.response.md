The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If m is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and 'YES' if all elements in the list `arr` are in non-decreasing order, or 'NO' otherwise is printed does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 1 and i is now m-1. 
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and 'YES' if all elements in the list `arr` are in non-decreasing order, or 'NO' otherwise is printed, m is greater than 1, i is m-1**
