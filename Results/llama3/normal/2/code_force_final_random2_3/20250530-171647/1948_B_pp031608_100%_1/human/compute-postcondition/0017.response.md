To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is not explicitly stated, but we know that `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive). Since the loop is counting down from `m - 1` to 0, we can infer that `i` is currently `m - 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be `m - 2 - 1 = m - 3`.

The other variables `n`, `arr`, `nums`, and `ans` are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `i` is `m - 3`**
