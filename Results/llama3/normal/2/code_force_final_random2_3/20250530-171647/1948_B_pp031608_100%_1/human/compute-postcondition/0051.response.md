The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `ans` is False if the list `arr` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `ans` is True, if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, the integer at index `i-1` is replaced with the first `m-2` digits of the integer at index `i-1` in `arr`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first `m-2` digits are the digits of the integer at index `i-1` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `i` in `arr`, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), and 'YES' if all elements in the list `arr` are in non-decreasing order, or 'NO' otherwise is printed, `m` is greater than 1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, `_` is 1**
