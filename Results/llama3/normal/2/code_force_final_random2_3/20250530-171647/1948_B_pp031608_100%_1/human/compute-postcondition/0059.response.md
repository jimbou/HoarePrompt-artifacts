Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where the element at index `i-1` is the first element of `nums`, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, `m` is greater than 1, and `_` is 1. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i-1]` has been updated to be the first element of `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `arr[i-1]` is now equal to the first element of `nums`, which is the first digit of the original value of `arr[i-1]`.
