Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `ans` is False if the list `arr` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `ans` is True, if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, the integer at index `i-1` is replaced with the first `m-2` digits of the integer at index `i-1` in `arr`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first `m-2` digits are the digits of the integer at index `i-1` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `i` in `arr`, `i` is `m-3`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), and 'YES' if all elements in the list `arr` are in non-decreasing order, or 'NO' otherwise is printed, `m` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers where the first `m-2` digits are the digits of the integer at index `m-4` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `m-3` in `arr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `nums` has been updated to be a list of integers where the first `m-2` digits are the digits of the integer at index `m-4` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `m-3` in `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
