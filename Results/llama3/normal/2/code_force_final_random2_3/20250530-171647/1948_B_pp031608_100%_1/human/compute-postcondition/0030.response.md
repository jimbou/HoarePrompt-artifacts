Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `ans` is False, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), and 'NO' is printed, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `m-1`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `nums` is updated to be a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the `i-1`th element of `arr` and the last element is the `i`th element of `arr`. The value of `ans` is set to False because the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`, indicating that the elements in `arr` are not in non-decreasing order. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
