Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the aforementioned operation any number of times (possibly zero). 

The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, and for each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element. If it is, the program splits the previous element into its digits and checks if the resulting list is sorted. If it is not, the program sets the answer to False and breaks the loop. 

After the loop, the program prints 'YES' if the answer is True and 'NO' otherwise. 

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the array is already sorted or when the array cannot be sorted using the given operation. 

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
