Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` is a combination of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the value of `arr[i]`. The digits of `arr[i - 1]` are converted to integers and added to the list, and then the value of `arr[i]` is appended to the list. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
