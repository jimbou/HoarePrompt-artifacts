Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the list of integers formed by the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order or not for all `i` from `m - 1` to 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has checked all pairs of adjacent elements in the list `arr` from the end to the beginning. If any pair of adjacent elements is not sorted in ascending order, the variable `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. The loop has also updated the elements in `arr` by replacing each element with its first digit if the element is less than the previous one. The variable `i` is now 1, indicating that the loop has finished checking all pairs of adjacent elements.
