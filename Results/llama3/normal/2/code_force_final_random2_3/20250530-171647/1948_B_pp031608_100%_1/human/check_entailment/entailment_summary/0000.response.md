Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given array of integers can be transformed into a non-decreasing order by rearranging the digits of adjacent elements.

The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, checking if the current element is less than the previous element. If it is, the program checks if the digits of the previous element can be rearranged to form a non-decreasing order with the current element. If they can, the program updates the previous element with the first digit of the rearranged digits. If they cannot, the program sets the answer to False and breaks out of the loop.

The program then prints 'YES' if the answer is True and 'NO' otherwise.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program, and the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
