Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99)**

The code reads an integer `m` from the input and assigns it to the variable `m`. Then, it reads `m` integers from the input and assigns them to the list `arr`. The variable `ans` is initialized to `True`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the remaining test cases in the input are not affected.
