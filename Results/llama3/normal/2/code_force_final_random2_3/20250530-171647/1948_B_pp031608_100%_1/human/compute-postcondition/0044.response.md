Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is False, nums is a list of integers where the first m-2 digits are the digits of the integer at index m-4 in arr and the last element is the integer at index m-3 in arr, i is m-3, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and 'YES' if all elements in the list arr are in non-decreasing order, or 'NO' otherwise is printed, m is greater than 1.**

The code sets `ans` to `False` and then breaks out of the loop. This means that the value of `ans` is now `False`, and the loop is terminated. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is still an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is still a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `nums` is still a list of integers where the first `m-2` digits are the digits of the integer at index `m-4` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `m-3` in `arr`, `i` is still `m-3`, stdin still contains `t-2` test cases, each test case still consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), and 'YES' if all elements in the list `arr` are in non-decreasing order, or 'NO' otherwise is printed, and `m` is still greater than 1.
