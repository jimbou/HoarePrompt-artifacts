Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, `m` is greater than 1, and `_` is 1. The current value of `i` is `m - 1`. The value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`.**
