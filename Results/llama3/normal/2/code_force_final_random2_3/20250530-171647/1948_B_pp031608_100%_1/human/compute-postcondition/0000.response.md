Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) because it is assigned the value of the first input, which is an integer between 2 and 50. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases because one test case has been read and processed. Each test case still consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).
