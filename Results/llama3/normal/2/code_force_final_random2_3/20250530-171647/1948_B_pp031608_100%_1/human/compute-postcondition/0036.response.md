The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is decreased by 1 so `i` is `m-2` and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True if all elements in the list arr are in non-decreasing order, otherwise ans is False, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and 'YES' if all elements in the list arr are in non-decreasing order, or 'NO' otherwise is printed, m is greater than 1, i is m-2**
