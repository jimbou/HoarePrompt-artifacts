The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`, which was initially `True`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed within. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the variables or their values.

Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is False, i is m - 1, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i].**
