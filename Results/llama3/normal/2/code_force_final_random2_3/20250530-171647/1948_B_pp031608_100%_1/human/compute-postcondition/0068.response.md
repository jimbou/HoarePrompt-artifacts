Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether `nums` is sorted in ascending order or not.**

In this output state, the value of `nums` has been updated to include the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `nums` now contains the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The value of `ans` is still either True or False depending on whether `nums` is sorted in ascending order or not.
