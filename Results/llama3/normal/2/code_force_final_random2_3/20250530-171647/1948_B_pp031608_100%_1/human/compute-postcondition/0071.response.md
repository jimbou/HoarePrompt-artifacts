Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]`, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]`, which is now stored in `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
