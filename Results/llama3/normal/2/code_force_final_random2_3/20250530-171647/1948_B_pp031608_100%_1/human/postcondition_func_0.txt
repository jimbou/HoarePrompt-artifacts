This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then checks if the list of integers can be transformed into a non-decreasing order by rearranging the digits of adjacent elements. If the list can be transformed, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for all test cases provided in the input.
