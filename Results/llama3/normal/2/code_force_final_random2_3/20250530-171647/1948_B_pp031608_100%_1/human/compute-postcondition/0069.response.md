Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), i is m - 2, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i], and ans is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`, which was previously either `True` or `False` depending on whether `nums` was sorted in ascending order or not. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables and is likely used to exit a loop or a conditional statement.

Since the value of `ans` is updated to `False`, the final state of the variables is as follows: `n` remains an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` remains an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` remains a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `i` remains `m - 2`, `nums` remains a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, and `ans` is now `False`.
