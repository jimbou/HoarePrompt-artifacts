Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, the integer at index `i-1` is replaced with the first `m-2` digits of the integer at index `i-1` in `arr`. `nums` is a list of integers where the first `m-2` digits are the digits of the integer at index `i-1` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `i` in `arr`. `i` is `m-3`. `ans` is False if the list `arr` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `ans` is True. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` is True.**
