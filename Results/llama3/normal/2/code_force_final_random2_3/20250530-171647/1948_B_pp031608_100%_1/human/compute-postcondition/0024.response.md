The code prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is determined by whether all elements in the list `arr` are in non-decreasing order. If all elements are in non-decreasing order, `ans` is `True`, and the code prints 'YES'. If any element is less than the previous one, `ans` is `False`, and the code prints 'NO'. The list `arr` contains `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), where `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The value of `n` and the elements of `arr` are provided as input through `stdin`.

Output: **YES if all elements in arr are in non-decreasing order, NO otherwise**
