Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and 'YES' if all elements in the list `arr` are in non-decreasing order, or 'NO' otherwise is printed**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been updated to the value of the first input, and `arr` now contains a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). The value of `ans` has been set to `True`. The number of test cases in `stdin` has been reduced by 1, as one test case has been processed. The remaining test cases still consist of two lines each, with the first line containing an integer `n` between 2 and 50 (inclusive), and the second line containing `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive).
