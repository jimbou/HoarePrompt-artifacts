Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `ans` is True, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m - 1`, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `nums`, which is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. This is because the code converts `arr[i - 1]` to a string, splits it into individual digits, converts each digit back to an integer, and then appends `arr[i]` to the end of the list.
