Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True, i is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, m is greater than 1, and _ is 1**

The code executes as follows:

1. `m = int(input())`: The value of `m` is updated to the integer value of the first input, which is between 2 and 50 (inclusive).

2. `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]`: The value of `arr` is updated to a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), where `n` is the value of the first input.

3. `ans = True`: The value of `ans` is set to `True`.

After the code executes, the state of the variables is as follows:

* `n` remains an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
* `m` is updated to the integer value of the first input, which is between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
* `arr` is updated to a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive).
* `ans` is set to `True`.
* `i` remains 0.
* `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99).
* Either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed.
* `m` is greater than 1.
* `_` remains 1.

Note that the code does not modify the values of `i`, `stdin`, or `_`.
