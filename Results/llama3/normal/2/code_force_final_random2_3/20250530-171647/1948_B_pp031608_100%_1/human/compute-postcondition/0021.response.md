Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]`, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to the variables.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first digit of its original value. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` and `m` still within their respective ranges, `arr` still a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99, `i` still equal to `m - 3`, and `nums` still containing the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the value of `arr[i]`. The value of `ans` remains False if `nums` is not sorted, and no changes are made to `ans` otherwise.
