Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive) where `arr[i - 1]` is the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]`, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether `nums` is sorted in ascending order or not.**

In this output state, the value of `arr[i - 1]` has been updated to be the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]`, which is stored in `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on whether `nums` is sorted in ascending order or not, but its value is not affected by the update of `arr[i - 1]`.
