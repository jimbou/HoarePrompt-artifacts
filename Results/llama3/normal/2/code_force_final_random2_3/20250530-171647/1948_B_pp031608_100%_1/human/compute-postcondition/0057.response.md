Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is False, i is m - 1, nums is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of arr[i - 1] and the last element is arr[i], stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, m is greater than 1, and _ is 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = False` and `break`. The first line sets the value of `ans` to `False`, overwriting its initial value of `True`. The second line, `break`, is used to exit a loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, it has no effect on the output state. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
