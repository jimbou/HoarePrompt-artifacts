Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is either True or False depending on whether the list of integers formed by the digits of arr[i - 1] and arr[i] is sorted in ascending order or not for all i from m - 1 to 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-n test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and 'YES' if all elements in the list arr are in non-decreasing order, or 'NO' otherwise is printed for each test case.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of `n` remains unchanged, `m` is equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the list of integers formed by the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` is sorted in ascending order or not for all `i` from `m - 1` to 1, and `i` is 0. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
