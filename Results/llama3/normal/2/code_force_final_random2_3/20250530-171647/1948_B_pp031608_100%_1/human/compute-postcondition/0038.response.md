Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is False, nums is a list of integers where the first m-2 digits are the digits of the integer at index i-1 in arr and the last element is the integer at index i in arr, i is m-2, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and 'YES' if all elements in the list arr are in non-decreasing order, or 'NO' otherwise is printed, m is greater than 1.**

The code snippet sets the value of `ans` to `False` and then breaks out of the loop. This means that the value of `ans` is updated to `False`, regardless of its previous value. The `break` statement does not affect any variables, but it does terminate the loop. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
