Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and 'YES' if all elements in the list `arr` are in non-decreasing order, or 'NO' otherwise is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True if all elements in the list arr are in non-decreasing order, otherwise ans is False, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and 'YES' if all elements in the list arr are in non-decreasing order, or 'NO' otherwise is printed, m is greater than 1, i is m-1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `ans` is False if the list `arr` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `ans` is True, if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, the integer at index `i-1` is replaced with the first `m-2` digits of the integer at index `i-1` in `arr`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first `m-2` digits are the digits of the integer at index `i-1` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `i` in `arr`, `i` is `m-2`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 99), and 'YES' if all elements in the list `arr` are in non-decreasing order, or 'NO' otherwise is printed, `m` is greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and equal to the value of the first input, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, the integer at index `i-1` is replaced with the first `m-2` digits of the integer at index `i-1` in `arr`. `nums` is a list of integers where the first `m-2` digits are the digits of the integer at index `i-1` in `arr` and the last element is the integer at index `i` in `arr`. `i` is `m-3`. `ans` is False if the list `arr` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `ans` is True. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False. Otherwise, `ans` is True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
