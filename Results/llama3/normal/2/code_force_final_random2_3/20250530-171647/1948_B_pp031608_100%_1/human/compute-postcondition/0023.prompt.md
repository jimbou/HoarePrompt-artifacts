Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is `m - 1`. If the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is equal to the first digit of the original value of `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If the digits in `nums` are not in ascending order, then `ans` is False. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. If the current value of `arr[i]` is not less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If the `(i-1)th` element of `arr` is greater than or equal to the `ith` element, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False. Otherwise, no specific value is assigned to `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `i` is `m - 3`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to its first digit, and a new list `nums` is created with the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
