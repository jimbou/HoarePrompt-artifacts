Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

3
4
12 3 45 67

The program will output "YES", but it should output "NO" because it is not possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the current element is less than the previous element, and if so, it tries to split the previous element into digits and checks if the resulting array is sorted. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made sorted in non-decreasing order.

A correct approach would be to iterate through the array from left to right and keep track of the maximum value that can be obtained by splitting the current element into digits. If the current element is less than the maximum value, then it is not possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is an example of a correct program:

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        max_val = 0
        for i in range(m):
            if arr[i] < max_val:
                ans = False
                break
            max_val = max(max_val, arr[i])
            if arr[i] >= 10:
                digits = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i])]
                max_val = max(max_val, digits[-1])
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])

This program correctly determines if the array can be made sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation.
