State: **n is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), arr is a list of n-1 integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive), ans is True if all elements in arr are in non-decreasing order, or False otherwise, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), and 'YES' if all elements in the list `arr` are in non-decreasing order, or 'NO' otherwise is printed**
