Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d` elements are each increased by 1 and the `d`-th element is increased by 1 plus the minimum of the first `d` elements, `d` is a positive integer such that `d < len(row)`, `i` is `len(row)`, and for all `j` such that `d <= j < len(row)`, `row[j]` is increased by 1 plus the minimum of the elements in the slice `row[max(0, j - (d + 1)):j]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d` elements are each increased by 1, and the `d`-th element is increased by 1 plus the minimum of the first `d` elements. For all elements after the `d`-th element, each element is increased by 1 plus the minimum of the elements in the slice of `d+1` elements preceding it. The loop has iterated over all elements in the list, and the value of `i` has reached the end of the list.
