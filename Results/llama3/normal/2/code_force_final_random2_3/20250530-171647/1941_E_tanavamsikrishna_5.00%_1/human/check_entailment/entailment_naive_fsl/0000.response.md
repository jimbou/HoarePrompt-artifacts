Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a solution to the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for bridges on a river. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row of the river. It iterates over the row, updating the cost of each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous cells and the maximum distance `d` between supports.

`func_2` reads the input data, calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`, and then calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

The program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases. It correctly calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row and the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is equal to 1, or when the river has only one row.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
