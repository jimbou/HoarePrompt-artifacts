To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and understand how the variables involved change.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):`. This means the loop will iterate as long as `i` is within the range defined by `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. The key variables here are `i`, `costs`, and `k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `d` is a positive integer
- `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers
- `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k+1` elements
- `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `costs` and the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` starting from index 1
- `i` is 1

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we only consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `costs`, and `k`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The length of `costs` must still be greater than `k` to ensure the loop can execute again, but since `k` is a constant in this context (its value does not change based on the loop), the requirement for `costs` to have at least `k+1` elements remains the same for the loop to potentially execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k+1` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `costs` and the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` starting from index 1, `i` is 2**
