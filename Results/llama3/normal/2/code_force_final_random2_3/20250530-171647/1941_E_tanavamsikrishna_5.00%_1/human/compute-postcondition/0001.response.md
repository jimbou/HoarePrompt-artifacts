To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `costs`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(costs)` is greater than `k - 1`. This means that `costs` must have at least `k` elements for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` will start at 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k` elements, `total_costs` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
