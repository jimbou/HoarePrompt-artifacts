Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of all possible subsequences of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows` as in the initial state. The `costs` list will remain unchanged. The `total_costs` list will contain the sum of all possible subsequences of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`. The loop variable `i` will have a value equal to the number of iterations, which is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
