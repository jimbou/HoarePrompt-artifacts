Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for a river with k consecutive rows, given the river's dimensions, the maximum distance between supports, and the costs of installing supports for each row.

Function `func_1` correctly calculates the cost of installing supports for a single row, taking into account the maximum distance between supports. It increments the first d-1 elements by 1 and then for each element from the d-th to the end, increments it by 1 plus the minimum of the previous d elements.

Function `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for a river with k consecutive rows. It reads the input, calculates the costs of installing supports for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost by summing the costs of k consecutive rows and taking the minimum of these sums.

The program also handles the input and output correctly, reading the number of test cases, the river's dimensions, the maximum distance between supports, and the costs of installing supports for each row, and printing the minimum total cost for each test case.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and produces the correct output for the given input.
