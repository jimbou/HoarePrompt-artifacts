The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum sum of all possible subsequences of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.

Since `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of all possible subsequences of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`, the `min` function will return the smallest sum among these subsequences.

Output: **the minimum sum of all possible subsequences of k consecutive elements in the costs list**
