#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers, d is a positive integer such that d < len(row).

        row[i] = row[i] + 1
        
    #State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d-1` elements are each increased by 1, `d` is a positive integer such that `d < len(row)`, `i` is `d-2`.

    #The program returns the last element of the list 'row', which is a non-negative integer that has been increased by 1 plus the minimum of the elements in the slice 'row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]', where 'i' is the length of the list 'row' and 'd' is a positive integer such that 'd < len(row)'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and a positive integer as input, modifies the list by incrementing the first d-1 elements by 1, and then for each element from the d-th to the end, increments it by 1 plus the minimum of the previous d elements. The function returns the last element of the modified list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row of the river and has length m. costs is a list of non-negative integers, where each integer represents the cost of installing supports for a row.
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]

    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of all possible subsequences of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: the minimum sum of all possible subsequences of k consecutive elements in the costs list

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the minimum total cost of installing supports for a river with k consecutive rows, given the river's dimensions, the maximum distance between supports, and the costs of installing supports for each row.
