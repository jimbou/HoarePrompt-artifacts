Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k+1` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `costs`, the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` starting from index 1, and the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` starting from index 2, `i` is 2**.

In this output state, the value of `total_costs` has been updated to include the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` starting from index 2, in addition to the previous sums. The other variables remain unchanged.
