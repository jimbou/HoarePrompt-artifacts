The code appends the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` starting from index `i` to the `total_costs` list. The value of `i` is 1, so the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` starting from index 1 is appended to `total_costs`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k+1` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `costs` and the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` starting from index 1, `i` is 1**
