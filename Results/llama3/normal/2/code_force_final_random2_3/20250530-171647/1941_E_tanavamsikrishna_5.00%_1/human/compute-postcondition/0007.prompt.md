Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row of the river and has length m. costs is a list of non-negative integers, where each integer represents the cost of installing supports for a row. total_costs is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
    total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k+1` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `costs` and the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` starting from index 1, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k+1` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `costs`, the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` starting from index 1, and the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs` starting from index 2, `i` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
