Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers, where each inner list represents a row of the river and has length m. costs is a list of non-negative integers, where each integer represents the cost of installing supports for a row. total_costs is an empty list.**

The code first reads four positive integers from the input and assigns them to n, m, k, and d, respectively. Then, it reads n rows of the river, where each row is a list of m non-negative integers, and stores them in the rows list. After that, it calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using the func_1 function and stores these costs in the costs list. Finally, it initializes an empty list called total_costs.
