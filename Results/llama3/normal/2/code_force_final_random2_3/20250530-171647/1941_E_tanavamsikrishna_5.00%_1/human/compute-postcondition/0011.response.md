The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, d and row, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `d` and `row`. If `i` is less than `len(row)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `d`, `d` is a positive integer such that `d < len(row)`, `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d` elements are each increased by 1 and the `d`-th element is increased by 1 plus the minimum of the first `d` elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` must be increased by 1 and `row` must be a list of non-negative integers where the first `d` elements are each increased by 1 and the `d`-th element is increased by 1 plus the minimum of the first `d` elements.
State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d` elements are each increased by 1 and the `d`-th element is increased by 1 plus the minimum of the first `d` elements, `d` is a positive integer such that `d < len(row)`, `i` is `d + 1`**
