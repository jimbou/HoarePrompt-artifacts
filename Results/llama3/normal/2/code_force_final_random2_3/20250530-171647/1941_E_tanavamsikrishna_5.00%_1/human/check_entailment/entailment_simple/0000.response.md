Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d` as input. It modifies the list `row` by increasing the first `d-1` elements by 1, and then for each element from the `d`-th to the end of the list, it increases the element by 1 plus the minimum of the elements in the slice `row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]`. The function returns the last element of the modified list `row`.

`func_2` takes no input and uses the input from the user to solve the problem. It reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, bridges `k`, and maximum distance between supports `d` from the user. It then reads the depths of the river cells for each row and stores them in the list `rows`. It calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1` and stores the costs in the list `costs`. It then calculates the total cost of installing supports for all possible subsequences of `k` consecutive rows and stores them in the list `total_costs`. Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The use of `func_1` to calculate the cost of installing supports for each row is correct, and the use of `func_2` to calculate the total cost of installing supports for all possible subsequences of `k` consecutive rows is also correct.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
