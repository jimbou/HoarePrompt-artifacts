The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and costs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `costs`. If `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `costs` must have at least `k` elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `costs` must have at least `k+1` elements.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `rows` is a list of lists of non-negative integers, `costs` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `k+1` elements, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `costs`, `i` is 1**
