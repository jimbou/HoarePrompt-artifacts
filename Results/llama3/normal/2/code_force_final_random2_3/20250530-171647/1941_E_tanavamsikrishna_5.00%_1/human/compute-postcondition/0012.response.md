Output State: **`row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first `d` elements are each increased by 1 and the `d`-th element is increased by 1 plus the minimum of the first `d` elements, `d` is a positive integer such that `d < len(row)`, `i` is `d + 1`, and `row[i]` is increased by 1 plus the minimum of the elements in the slice `row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The list `row` has been modified such that the first `d` elements have been incremented by 1, and the `d`-th element has been incremented by 1 plus the minimum of the first `d` elements. The value of `i` remains `d + 1`. Additionally, the element at index `i` in the list `row` has been incremented by 1 plus the minimum of the elements in the slice `row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]`. The value of `d` remains unchanged.
