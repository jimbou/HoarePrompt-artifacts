Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Function 1 correctly calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row of the river. It first increments the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1, then for each element from the `d`-th to the end, it increments it by 1 plus the minimum of the previous `d` elements. The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.

Function 2 correctly calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows of the river. It first reads the input data, including the number of rows, columns, bridges, and the maximum distance between supports. It then calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using Function 1 and stores these costs in the `costs` list. The function then calculates the sum of all possible subsequences of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list and stores these sums in the `total_costs` list. Finally, it prints the minimum sum in the `total_costs` list, which represents the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows of the river.

Correctness: **True**
