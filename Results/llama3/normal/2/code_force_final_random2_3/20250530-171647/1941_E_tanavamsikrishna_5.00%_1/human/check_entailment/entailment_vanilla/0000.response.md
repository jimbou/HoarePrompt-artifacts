Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river. The program consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a row of the river and the maximum distance between supports `d` as input. It calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for that row by iterating through the row and updating the cost of each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous cells within the distance `d`. The function returns the total cost of installing supports for that row.

`func_2` reads the input data, including the number of rows `n`, the number of columns `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance between supports `d`. It then reads the depths of the river cells for each row and calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`. The function then calculates the total cost of installing supports for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It iterates through each row and calculates the minimum cost of installing supports based on the previous cells within the distance `d`. It also correctly calculates the total cost of installing supports for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.

However, there is a small mistake in the `func_1` function. In the line `row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1`, the `max(0, i - (d + 1))` should be `max(0, i - d)` instead. This is because the distance between supports is `d`, not `d + 1`.

Correctness: **False**
