Output State: **`num` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`**

In this output state, the value of `ma` is calculated as the integer division of `num2` by 2, minus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
