Output State: **`num` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers containing only the digits from the string `case`, `b` is a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string `case`, `median` is an integer, `new_median` is an integer, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer and a string.**

In this output state, the value of `ma` is calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1`, which means it is the integer part of half of `num2` minus 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains 1 less input: an integer and a string.
