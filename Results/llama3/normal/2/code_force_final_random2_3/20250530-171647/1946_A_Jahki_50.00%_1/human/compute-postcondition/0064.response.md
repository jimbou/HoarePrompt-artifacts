Output State: **num is at least 3, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 2, a is a list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, median is an integer equal to b[ma] before the code execution, new_median is b[ma] which is greater than its original value by 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `b[ma]`, `op`, and `new_median`. The first line increments the value of `b[ma]` by 1, which affects the value of `new_median` since it is assigned the value of `b[ma]` after the increment. The second line increments the value of `op` by 1. The third line sorts the list `b` in ascending order, which does not change the values of its elements but rearranges them. The fourth line assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`, which is now greater than its original value by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
