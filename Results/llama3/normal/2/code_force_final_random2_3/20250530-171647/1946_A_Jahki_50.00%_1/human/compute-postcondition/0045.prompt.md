Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: num is at least 2, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, median is an integer, new_median is an integer. If num2 is even, median and new_median are equal to b[(int(num2 / 2) - 1)]. If num2 is odd, median and new_median are equal to b[(int(num2 / 2))].
Code of the loop:
while new_median <= median:
    b[ma] += 1
    op += 1
    b = sorted(b)
    new_median = b[ma]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: num is at least 2, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 1, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, median is an integer, new_median is the value of the element at index ma in the sorted list b
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: num is at least 2, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 2, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, median is greater than or equal to new_median, new_median is the value of the element at index ma in the sorted list b which is one more than its original value
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: num is at least 2, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 3, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, new_median is equal to the value of b at index ma, which is greater than or equal to the original value of b at index ma


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
