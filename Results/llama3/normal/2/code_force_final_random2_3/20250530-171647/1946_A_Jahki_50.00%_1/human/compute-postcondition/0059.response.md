Postcondition: ***num is at least 3, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, median is an integer, new_median is an integer, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer and a string. If num2 is even, ma is int(num2 / 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is half of num2 rounded down to the nearest integer.***
