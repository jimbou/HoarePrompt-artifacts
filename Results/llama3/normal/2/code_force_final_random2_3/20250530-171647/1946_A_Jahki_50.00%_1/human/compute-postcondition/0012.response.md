The code `ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1` assigns the value of `int(num2 / 2) - 1` to the variable `ma`. Since `num2` is an even integer not larger than 10000, `num2 / 2` will be an integer. Therefore, `ma` will be an integer equal to `num2 / 2 - 1`.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`num` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `num2` is an even integer not larger than 10000, `case` is a string, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that are digits in the string `case`, `b` is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string `case`, `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2 - 1`, stdin contains no input**
