The variables in the loop head are `new_median` and `median`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `new_median` and `median`. If `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `new_median` is the value of the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`, and `median` is an integer. For the loop to execute again, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`, so we need to adjust `median` to be greater than or equal to `new_median`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`num` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `median` is greater than or equal to `new_median`, `new_median` is the value of the element at index `ma` in the sorted list `b`**
