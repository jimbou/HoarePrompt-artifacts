The variables in the loop head are new_median and median, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables new_median and median. If new_median is less than or equal to median, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, new_median is greater than its original value by 1, and median is an integer equal to b[ma] before the code execution. For the loop to execute one more time, new_median must be less than or equal to median. Since new_median is greater than its original value by 1, we need to adjust median to be greater than its original value by 1 as well.

State: **num is at least 3, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 2, a is a list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, median is an integer equal to b[ma] before the code execution and greater than its original value by 1, new_median is b[ma] which is greater than its original value by 1**
