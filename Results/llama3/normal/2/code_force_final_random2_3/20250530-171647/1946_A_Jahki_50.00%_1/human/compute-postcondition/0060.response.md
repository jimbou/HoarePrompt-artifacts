Output State: **num is at least 3, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, median is an integer equal to b[ma], new_median is an integer equal to b[ma], stdin contains 1 less input: an integer and a string. If num2 is even, ma is int(num2 / 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is half of num2 rounded down to the nearest integer.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `b[ma]` to both `median` and `new_median`. The value of `ma` depends on whether `num2` is even or odd, but regardless of its value, `b[ma]` will be an integer from the sorted list `b`, which contains only the digits from the string `case`. Therefore, both `median` and `new_median` will be integers equal to the value of `b[ma]`. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
