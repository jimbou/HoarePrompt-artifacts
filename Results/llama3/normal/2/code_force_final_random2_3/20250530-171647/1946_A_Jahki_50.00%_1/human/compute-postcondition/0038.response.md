Output State: **num is at least 2, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, median is an integer, new_median is an integer. If num2 is even, median and new_median are equal to b[(int(num2 / 2) - 1)]. If num2 is odd, median and new_median are equal to b[(int(num2 / 2))].**

The code assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `median` and then assigns the value of `median` to `new_median`. Since `ma` is either `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `int(num2 / 2)` if `num2` is odd, the value of `median` and `new_median` depends on the parity of `num2`. If `num2` is even, `median` and `new_median` are equal to `b[(int(num2 / 2) - 1)]`, and if `num2` is odd, they are equal to `b[(int(num2 / 2))]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
