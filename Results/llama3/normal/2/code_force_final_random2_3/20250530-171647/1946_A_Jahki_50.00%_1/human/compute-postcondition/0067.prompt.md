Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: num is at least 3, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, median is an integer equal to b[ma], new_median is an integer equal to b[ma], stdin contains 1 less input: an integer and a string. If num2 is even, ma is int(num2 / 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is half of num2 rounded down to the nearest integer.
Code of the loop:
while new_median <= median:
    b[ma] += 1
    op += 1
    b = sorted(b)
    new_median = b[ma]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: num is at least 3, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 1, a is a list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, median is an integer equal to b[ma] before the code execution, new_median is equal to b[ma] after the code execution, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer and a string. If num2 is even, ma is int(num2 / 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is half of num2 rounded down to the nearest integer.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: num is at least 3, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 2, a is a list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, median is an integer equal to b[ma] before the code execution, new_median is b[ma] which is greater than its original value by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: num is at least 3, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 3, a is a list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, median is an integer equal to b[ma] before the code execution, new_median is b[ma] which is greater than its original value by 1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
