According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `new_median` and `median`. If `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]` after the code execution and `median` is an integer equal to `b[ma]` before the code execution. Since `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]` after the code execution, it is possible that `new_median` is greater than `median`, so it needs to be adjusted to `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`num` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is 1, `a` is a list of integers containing only the digits from the string `case`, `b` is a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string `case`, `median` is an integer equal to `b[ma]` before the code execution, `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`, `stdin` contains 1 less input: an integer and a string.**
