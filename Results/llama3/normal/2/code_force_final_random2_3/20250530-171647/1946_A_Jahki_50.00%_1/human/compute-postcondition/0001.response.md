According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), so it needs to be adjusted to `num` is at least 1 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`num` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
