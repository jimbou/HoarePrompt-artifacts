Output State: **num is at least 1, i is 0, num2 is an integer not larger than 10000, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b, new_median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b, stdin contains no input.**

The code assigns the value of the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b to median and new_median. The value of median and new_median is an integer that is equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b. No other variables are affected.
