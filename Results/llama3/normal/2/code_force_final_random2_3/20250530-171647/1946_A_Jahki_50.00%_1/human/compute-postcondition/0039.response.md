To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `new_median <= median`. Since `median` and `new_median` are dependent on `num2` and the list `b`, we should focus on adjusting the state of `num2` and `b` if necessary.

Given that `num2` is an integer, and `median` and `new_median` are determined by the value of `num2` and the sorted list `b`, we need to consider the cases when `num2` is even and odd.

If `num2` is even, `median` and `new_median` are equal to `b[(int(num2 / 2) - 1)]`. In this case, `new_median` will always be equal to `median`, so the loop condition `new_median <= median` will always be true.

If `num2` is odd, `median` and `new_median` are equal to `b[(int(num2 / 2))]`. In this case, `new_median` will also always be equal to `median`, so the loop condition `new_median <= median` will always be true.

Since `new_median` will always be equal to `median` regardless of whether `num2` is even or odd, the loop condition `new_median <= median` will always be true. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **num is at least 2, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, median is an integer, new_median is an integer**
