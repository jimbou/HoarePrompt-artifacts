The variables in the loop head are new_median and median, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables new_median and median. If new_median is less than or equal to median, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, new_median is less than median, so no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **num is at least 1, i is 0, num2 is an integer not larger than 10000, case is a string, op is 2, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b, new_median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b and is less than median, stdin contains no input.**
