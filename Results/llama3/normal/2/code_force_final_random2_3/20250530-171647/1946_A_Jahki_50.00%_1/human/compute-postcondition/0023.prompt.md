Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: num is at least 1, i is 0, num2 is an integer not larger than 10000, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b, new_median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
while new_median <= median:
    b[ma] += 1
    op += 1
    b = sorted(b)
    new_median = b[ma]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: num is at least 1, i is 0, num2 is an integer not larger than 10000, case is a string, op is 1, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b, new_median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b and must be less than or equal to median, stdin contains no input.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: num is at least 1, i is 0, num2 is an integer not larger than 10000, case is a string, op is 2, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b, new_median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b and is less than median, stdin contains no input.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: num is at least 1, i is 0, num2 is an integer not larger than 10000, case is a string, op is 3, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b, new_median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b and is less than median, stdin contains no input.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
