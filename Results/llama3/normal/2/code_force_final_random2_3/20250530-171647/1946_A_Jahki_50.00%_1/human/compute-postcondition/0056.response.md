Output State: **num is at least 3, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, median is an integer, new_median is an integer, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer and a string.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `a` and `b`. The first line creates a new list `a` containing only the digits from the string `case`, which are converted to integers. The second line sorts the list `a` in ascending order and assigns it to `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
