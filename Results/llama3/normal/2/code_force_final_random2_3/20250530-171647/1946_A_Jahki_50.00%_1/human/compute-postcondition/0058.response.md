Output State: **`num` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers containing only the digits from the string `case`, `b` is a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string `case`, `median` is an integer, `new_median` is an integer, `ma` is half of `num2` rounded down to the nearest integer, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer and a string.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `num` is still at least 3, `i` is still 2, `num2` is still an integer, `case` is still a string, `op` is still 0, `a` is still a list of integers containing only the digits from the string `case`, `b` is still a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string `case`, `median` is still an integer, `new_median` is still an integer, and `ma` is now half of `num2` rounded down to the nearest integer. The stdin still contains 1 less input: an integer and a string.
