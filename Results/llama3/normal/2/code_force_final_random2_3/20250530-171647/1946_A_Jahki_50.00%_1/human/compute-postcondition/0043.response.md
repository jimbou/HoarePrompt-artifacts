The variables in the loop head are new_median and median, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables new_median and median. If new_median is less than or equal to median, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, new_median is the value of the element at index ma in the sorted list b which is one more than its original value and median is greater than or equal to new_median. For the loop to execute one more time, new_median must be less than median. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **num is at least 2, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 2, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, new_median is less than median**
