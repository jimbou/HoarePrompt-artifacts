Postcondition: ***num is at least 1, i is 0, num2 is an integer not larger than 10000, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, stdin contains no input. If num2 is even, ma is an integer equal to num2 / 2 - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is an integer equal to (num2-1)/2.***
