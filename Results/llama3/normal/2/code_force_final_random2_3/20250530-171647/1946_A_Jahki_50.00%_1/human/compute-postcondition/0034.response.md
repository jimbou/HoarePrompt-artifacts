Output State: **num is at least 2, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line creates a list `a` by iterating over the characters in the string `case`, filtering out non-digit characters, and converting the remaining characters to integers. The second line sorts the list `a` in ascending order and assigns the result to `b`. 

Since `num` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, and `op` is 0, these variables remain unchanged. The only new information is that `a` is a list of integers and `b` is a sorted list of integers.
