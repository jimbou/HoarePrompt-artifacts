Output State: **num is at least 1, i is 0, num2 is an integer not larger than 10000, case is a string, op is an integer, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b, new_median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b and is greater than median, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has terminated, and the value of new_median is now greater than the value of median. The loop has executed a certain number of times, and the value of op has been incremented accordingly. The lists a and b remain unchanged, and the value of median remains the same. The input from stdin is still empty.
