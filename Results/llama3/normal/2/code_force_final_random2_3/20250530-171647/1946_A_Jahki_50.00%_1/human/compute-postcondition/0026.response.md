Postcondition: ***num is at least 1, i is 0, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is an integer, stdin contains no input. If num2 is greater than 10000, the number 1 is printed, the number 16668 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If num2 is not larger than 10000, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b, new_median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b and is greater than median, and op is printed.***
