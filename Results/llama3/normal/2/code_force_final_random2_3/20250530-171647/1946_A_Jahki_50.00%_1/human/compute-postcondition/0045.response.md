Output State: **num is at least 2, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, median is an integer, new_median is an integer.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the exception that the value of op has increased by the number of iterations. The values of num, i, num2, case, a, b, median, and new_median remain unchanged.
