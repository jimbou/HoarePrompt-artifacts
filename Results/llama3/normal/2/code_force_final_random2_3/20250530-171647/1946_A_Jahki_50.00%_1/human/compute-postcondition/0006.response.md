Based on the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed when the statement executes.

The code snippet is a simple `print` statement with a constant value:
```
print(16668)
```
There are no variables or objects involved in this statement, so we don't need to consider the values of `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, or the state of `stdin`.

The `print` statement will simply output the constant value `16668`.

Output: **16668**
