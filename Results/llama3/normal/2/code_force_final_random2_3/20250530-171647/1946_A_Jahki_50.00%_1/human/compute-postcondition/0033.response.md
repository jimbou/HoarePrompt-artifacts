Output State: **`num` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is 0, stdin contains no input, 1 is printed, 16668 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, and `op` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains no input, and the numbers 1 and 16668 are still printed. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
