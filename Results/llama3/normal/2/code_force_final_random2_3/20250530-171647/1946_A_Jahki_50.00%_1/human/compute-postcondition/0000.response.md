Output State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)**

In this output state, the value of `num` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive) because it is assigned the value of the first line of each test case, which contains a single integer n. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now only contains one line of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), because the first line of each test case has been read and assigned to `num`.
