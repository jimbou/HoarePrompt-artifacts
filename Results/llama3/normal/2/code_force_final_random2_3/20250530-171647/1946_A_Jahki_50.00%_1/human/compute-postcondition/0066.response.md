Output State: **num is at least 3, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is 3, a is a list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, b is a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string case, median is an integer equal to b[ma] before the code execution, new_median is b[ma] which is greater than its original value by 1**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `num` remains at least 3, and `i` remains 2. The value of `num2` is still an integer, and the string `case` remains unchanged. The value of `op` has been incremented by 1, making it 3. The list `a` still contains only the digits from the string `case`, and the list `b` is still a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string `case`. The value of `median` is still an integer equal to the original value of `b[ma]`, but the value of `new_median` has been updated to be 1 greater than its original value, which is now equal to the new value of `b[ma]`.
