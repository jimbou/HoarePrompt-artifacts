Postcondition: ***num is at least 3, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, median is an integer, new_median is an integer, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer and a string. If num2 > 10000, then 1 and 16668 are printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, a and b are lists of integers containing only the digits from the string case, median and new_median are integers equal to b[ma] before and after the code execution respectively. If num2 is even, ma is int(num2 / 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is half of num2 rounded down to the nearest integer, and the value of op is being printed.***
