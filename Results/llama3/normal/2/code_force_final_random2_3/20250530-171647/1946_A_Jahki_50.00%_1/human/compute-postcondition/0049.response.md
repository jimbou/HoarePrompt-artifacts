The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num`. If `i` is less than `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `num` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `num` must be greater than 2.

State: **`num` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `median` is an integer, `new_median` is an integer.**
