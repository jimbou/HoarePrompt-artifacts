Output State: **num is at least 1, i is 0, num2 is an integer not larger than 10000, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the values of `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code creates two new lists, `a` and `b`. List `a` contains the digits from the string `case` that are converted to integers. List `b` is a sorted version of list `a`, containing the same digits in ascending order.
