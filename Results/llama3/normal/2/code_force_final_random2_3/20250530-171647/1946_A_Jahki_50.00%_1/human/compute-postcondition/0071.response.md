Output State: **num is 0, i is equal to the initial value of num, stdin contains no input, and the value of op is printed for each test case where num2 is not larger than 10000.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `num` will be 0, and the variable `i` will be equal to the initial value of `num`. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, and the value of `op` will be printed for each test case where `num2` is not larger than 10000.
