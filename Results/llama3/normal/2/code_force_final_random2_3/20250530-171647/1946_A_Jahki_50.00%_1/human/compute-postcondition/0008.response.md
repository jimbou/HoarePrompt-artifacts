Output State: **num is at least 1, i is 0, num2 is an integer greater than 10000, case is a string, op is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, the number 1 is being printed, and the number 16668 is being printed**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The values of num, i, num2, case, and op remain the same as in the initial state. The code does not read any input from stdin, so the stdin remains empty. The numbers 1 and 16668 are still being printed.
