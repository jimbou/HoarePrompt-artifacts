Output State: **num is at least 1, i is 0, num2 is an odd integer not larger than 10000, case is a string, op is 0, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, stdin contains no input, and ma is an integer equal to (num2-1)/2**

In this output state, the value of ma is calculated as the integer division of num2 by 2. Since num2 is an odd integer, the result of the division is the integer part of (num2-1)/2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
