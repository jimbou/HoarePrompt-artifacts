This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains the number of integers in the second line. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the integers to a value greater than the original median. If the number of integers is greater than 10,000, it prints a fixed value of 1 and 16,668, and stops processing further test cases. Otherwise, it prints the calculated number of operations for each test case.
