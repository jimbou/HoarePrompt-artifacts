To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `new_median` and `median`. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. At the end of the last iteration, `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. To ensure the loop can execute again, `new_median` must be less than `median`.

State: **num is at least 1, i is 0, num2 is an integer not larger than 10000, case is a string, op is 1, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b, new_median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b and must be less than median, stdin contains no input.**
