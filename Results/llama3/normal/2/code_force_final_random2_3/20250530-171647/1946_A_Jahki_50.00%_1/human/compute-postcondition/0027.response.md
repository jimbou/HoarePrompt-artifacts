To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for i in range(0, num):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `num`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `num` is at least 1
- `i` is 0
- `num2` is an integer
- `case` is a string
- `op` is an integer
- `stdin` contains no input

And the conditions within the loop body that could affect the loop's continuation (though the loop body is omitted, the description provides insight into what happens within it):

- If `num2` is greater than 10000, the loop breaks.
- If `num2` is not larger than 10000, certain operations are performed, but the loop does not break based on the description provided.

Since we are only concerned with the state of variables in the loop head (`i` and `num`), and given that `i` must be less than `num` for the loop to execute again:

- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration. So, `i` becomes 1.
- `num` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is now 1, `num` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

The states of `num2`, `case`, `op`, and `stdin` are not directly relevant to the loop's continuation based on the loop head alone, so they do not need to be adjusted for the purpose of determining the state at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`num` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input.**
