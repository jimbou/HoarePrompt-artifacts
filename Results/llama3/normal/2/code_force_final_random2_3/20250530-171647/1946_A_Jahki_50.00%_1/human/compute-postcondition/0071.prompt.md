Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    op = 0
    if num2 > 10000:
        print(1)
        print(16668)
        break
    else:
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
        median = b[ma]
        new_median = median
        while new_median <= median:
            b[ma] += 1
            op += 1
            b = sorted(b)
            new_median = b[ma]
        print(op)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *num is at least 1, i is 0, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is an integer, stdin contains no input. If num2 is greater than 10000, the number 1 is printed, the number 16668 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If num2 is not larger than 10000, a is a list of integers that are digits in the string case, b is a sorted list of integers that are digits in the string case, median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b, new_median is an integer equal to the (num2/2 - 1)th or ((num2-1)/2)th element in the sorted list b and is greater than median, and op is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *num is at least 2, i is 1, num2 is an integer, case is a string, op is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, median is an integer, new_median is an integer. If num2 is larger than 10000, 1 and 16668 are printed and the innermost loop or if statement is terminated. Otherwise, the value of op is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *num is at least 3, i is 2, num2 is an integer, case is a string, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, median is an integer, new_median is an integer, stdin contains 1 less input: an integer and a string. If num2 > 10000, then 1 and 16668 are printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, a and b are lists of integers containing only the digits from the string case, median and new_median are integers equal to b[ma] before and after the code execution respectively. If num2 is even, ma is int(num2 / 2) - 1. If num2 is odd, ma is half of num2 rounded down to the nearest integer, and the value of op is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
