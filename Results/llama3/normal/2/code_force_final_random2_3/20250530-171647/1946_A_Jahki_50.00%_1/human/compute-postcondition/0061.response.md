To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `new_median <= median` and adjust the states of the objects involved in this condition.

The objects involved in the loop head are `new_median` and `median`. According to the code, `median` is an integer equal to `b[ma]`, and `new_median` is an integer equal to `b[ma]`. This means that both `median` and `new_median` are currently equal.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `new_median <= median` must be true. Since `new_median` and `median` are currently equal, we need to adjust the state of `new_median` to be less than or equal to `median`.

However, we cannot adjust the state of `median` because it is not a variable that can be changed. Instead, we can adjust the state of `new_median` to be less than or equal to `median`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`num` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers containing only the digits from the string `case`, `b` is a sorted list of integers containing only the digits from the string `case`, `median` is an integer equal to `b[ma]`, `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`, `stdin` contains 1 less input: an integer and a string. If `num2` is even, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`. If `num2` is odd, `ma` is half of `num2` rounded down to the nearest integer.**
