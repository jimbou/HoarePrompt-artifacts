Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string that is the concatenation of the original `s1` and the string representation of the integer `i`, `s2` is a string that is the concatenation of the original `s2` and the string representation of the integer `i`, `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`, alphabet is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet if its length is not 1, otherwise it is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to 'z' with one character removed if i is in the alphabet.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables retain their original values and properties, and a new variable `r` is introduced, which is the result of the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`. The alphabet set remains the same, with a possible removal of one character if `i` is in the alphabet and its length is not 1.
