Output State: **s is a string of lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 2 characters, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, s2 is a string that is the concatenation of the original s2 and the string representation of the integer i, alphabet is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet.**

In this output state, the values of `s`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `s2` is concatenated with the string representation of the integer `i`, resulting in a new string. The variable `alphabet` is created as a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet, where k is an integer between 1 and 26.
