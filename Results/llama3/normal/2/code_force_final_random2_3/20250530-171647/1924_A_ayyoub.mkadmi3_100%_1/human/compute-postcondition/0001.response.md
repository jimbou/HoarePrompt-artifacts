According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s. If the string s has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, s1 and s2 are empty strings, and alphabet is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets. So for the loop to be executed  the string s must have at least 1 character and the character i is the first character in the string s.
State: **s is a string of lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, s1 is an empty string, s2 is an empty string, alphabet is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, i is the first character in the string s**
