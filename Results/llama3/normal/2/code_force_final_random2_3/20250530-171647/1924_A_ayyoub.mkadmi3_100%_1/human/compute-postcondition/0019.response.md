Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English alphabets with at least one character, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string that is the concatenation of the original `s1` and the string representation of the integer `i`. If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, `alphabet` is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet with at least two characters removed. Otherwise, `alphabet` is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet with at least one character removed, and `s2` is a string that is the concatenation of the original `s2` and the string representation of the integer `i`.***
