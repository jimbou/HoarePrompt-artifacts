Postcondition: ***s is a string of lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. If the first character of s is in the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, then s1 is a string containing the first character of s. If the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets has only 1 element, then s2 is a string containing the first character of s, otherwise s2 is an empty string. The set of the first k lowercase English alphabets is updated by excluding the first character of s if the set has more than 1 element, otherwise it remains the same.***
