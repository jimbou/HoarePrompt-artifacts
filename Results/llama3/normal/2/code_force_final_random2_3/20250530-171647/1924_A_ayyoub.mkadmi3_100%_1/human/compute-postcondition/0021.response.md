Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English alphabets with at least one character, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. If `i` is in the set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet with at least one character removed, then `s1` is a string that is the concatenation of the original `s1`, the string representation of the integer `i`, and the string representation of the integer `i` again, and `alphabet` is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet with at least two characters removed if the length of `alphabet` is not 1, otherwise it is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet with at least one character removed, and `s2` is a string that is the concatenation of the original `s2` and the string representation of the integer `i`. Otherwise, there is no change in `s1`, `alphabet`, and `s2`.***
