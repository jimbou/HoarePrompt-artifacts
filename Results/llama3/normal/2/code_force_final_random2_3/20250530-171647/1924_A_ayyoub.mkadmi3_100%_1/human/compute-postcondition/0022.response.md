Output State: **s is a string of lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. s1 is a string that is the concatenation of the original s1 and the string representation of the integer i. If i is in the alphabet, then one character is removed from alphabet if its length is not 1. Otherwise, alphabet is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet. s2 is a string that is the concatenation of the original s2 and the string representation of the integer i.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a string of lowercase English alphabets, with k and n being integers within the range of 1 to 26. The string s1 is a concatenation of the original s1 and the string representation of the integer i, where i is a character in the alphabet. If the length of the alphabet is not 1, then one character is removed from the alphabet. Otherwise, the alphabet remains the same. The string s2 is a concatenation of the original s2 and the string representation of the integer i.
