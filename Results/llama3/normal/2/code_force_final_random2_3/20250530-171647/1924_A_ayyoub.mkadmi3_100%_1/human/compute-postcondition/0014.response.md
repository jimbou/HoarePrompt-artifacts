Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string that is the concatenation of the original `s1` and the string representation of the integer `i`, if the length of alphabet is not 1, one character is removed from alphabet. Otherwise, `alphabet` is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet.**

In this output state, the value of `s1` has been updated by concatenating the string representation of the integer `i` to its original value. The other variables `s`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged. The condition regarding the length of `alphabet` and the removal of a character from it is still applicable.
