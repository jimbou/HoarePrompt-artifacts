Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string of lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. The length of s is at least n. The string s only contains the first k lowercase English alphabets. s1 is an empty string, s2 is an empty string, and alphabet is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in alphabet:
        if len(alphabet) != 1:
            alphabet.remove(i)
        else:
            s2 += i
            alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
        s1 += i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *s is a string of lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 character, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. If the first character of s is in the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, then s1 is a string containing the first character of s. If the set of the first k lowercase English alphabets has only 1 element, then s2 is a string containing the first character of s, otherwise s2 is an empty string. The set of the first k lowercase English alphabets is updated by excluding the first character of s if the set has more than 1 element, otherwise it remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string of lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string that is the concatenation of the original `s1` and the string representation of the integer `i`. If `i` is in the alphabet, then one character is removed from alphabet if its length is not 1. Otherwise, `alphabet` is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string of lowercase English alphabets with at least one character, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. If `i` is in the set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet with at least one character removed, then `s1` is a string that is the concatenation of the original `s1`, the string representation of the integer `i`, and the string representation of the integer `i` again, and `alphabet` is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet with at least two characters removed if the length of `alphabet` is not 1, otherwise it is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet with at least one character removed, and `s2` is a string that is the concatenation of the original `s2` and the string representation of the integer `i`. Otherwise, there is no change in `s1`, `alphabet`, and `s2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
