Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English alphabets with at least one character, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string that is the concatenation of the original `s1`, the string representation of the integer `i`, and the string representation of the integer `i` again, `alphabet` is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet with at least two characters removed if the length of `alphabet` is not 1, otherwise it is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet with at least one character removed, and `s2` is a string that is the concatenation of the original `s2` and the string representation of the integer `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `s1` has been updated to include the string representation of the integer `i` twice, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
