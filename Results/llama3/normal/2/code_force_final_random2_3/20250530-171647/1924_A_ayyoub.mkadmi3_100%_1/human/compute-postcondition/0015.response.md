Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `s1` is a string that is the concatenation of the original `s1` and the string representation of the integer `i`. If `i` is in the alphabet, then one character is removed from alphabet if its length is not 1. Otherwise, `alphabet` is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet.***
