Output State: **`s` is a string of lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 characters, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `alphabet` has one character removed from it.**

In this output state, the string `s` still contains lowercase English alphabets but now it can have at least 1 character because one character has been removed from `alphabet`. The values of `k` and `n` remain the same as they were not affected by the code. The `alphabet` variable has one character removed from it.
