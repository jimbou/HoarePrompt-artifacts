You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. The length of s is at least n. The string s only contains the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: s is a string of lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26. s1 is a string that is the concatenation of the original s1 and the string representation of the integer i. If i is in the alphabet, then one character is removed from alphabet if its length is not 1. Otherwise, alphabet is a set of lowercase English alphabets from 'a' to the kth letter of the alphabet. s2 is a string that is the concatenation of the original s2 and the string representation of the integer i.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three values: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n` times `k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2`. The boolean value depends on the length of `s1` and the values of `n` and `k`. The substring of `s1` depends on the value of `r`, which is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`. The string `s2` is the concatenation of the original `s2` and the string representation of the integer `i`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple containing three values: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n` times `k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2`. The boolean value depends on the length of `s1` and the values of `n` and `k`. The substring of `s1` depends on the value of `r`, which is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`. The string `s2` is the concatenation of the original `s2` and the string representation of the integer `i`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
