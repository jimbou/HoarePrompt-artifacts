Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of checking whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of a given string s. If not, it also needs to print a string of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases t and initializing an empty list OUT to store the output for each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the values of n, k, and m, and the string s. It then calls the function func_1 with these values.

3. The function func_1 initializes two empty strings s1 and s2, and a set alphabet containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. It then iterates over the string s. If a character is in the set alphabet, it removes the character from the set and adds it to s1. If the set alphabet becomes empty, it resets it to the original set and adds the character to s2.

4. After iterating over the entire string s, the function calculates the value r as the integer division of the length of s1 by k. It then returns a tuple containing a boolean value b, and the strings s1[r*k:] and s2. The boolean value b is True if the length of s1 is greater than or equal to n*k, indicating that all possible strings of length n can be formed as a subsequence of s.

5. If the boolean value b is False, the program appends 'No' to the list OUT and constructs a string of length n that does not occur as a subsequence of s. It does this by finding the first character in the range of the first k lowercase English alphabets that is not in s1, and repeating this character n-len(s2) times. It then appends this string to OUT.

6. If the boolean value b is True, the program simply appends 'Yes' to the list OUT.

7. Finally, the program prints each element in the list OUT.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly solves the problem and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
