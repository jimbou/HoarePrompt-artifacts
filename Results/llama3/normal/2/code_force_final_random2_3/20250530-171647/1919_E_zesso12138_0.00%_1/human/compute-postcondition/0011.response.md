To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for res in results:`. This means we can only adjust the state of `res` and `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least two results, the loop can execute again for the second result.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least one result of `func_1(n, p)`, and `res` is the first result in `results`.

For the loop to execute again, `results` must have at least two results, and `res` must be the second result in `results`.

State: **`n` is the integer value at `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is `1 + n + 1 + ... + n` (t times), `results` is a list containing at least two results of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is equal to the initial value of `t`, `_` is `t-1`, `res` is the second result in `results`**
