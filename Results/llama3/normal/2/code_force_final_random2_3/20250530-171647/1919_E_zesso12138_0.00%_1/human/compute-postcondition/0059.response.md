Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `dp[j - 1]` is `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + new_dp[j + 1]) % MOD`, `j` is 0, `new_dp[j - 1]` is `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `new_dp[j - 1]` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and `dp[j]`, modulo `MOD`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `j` is still greater than or equal to 1, and `j + 1` is still less than or equal to `2 * n`.
