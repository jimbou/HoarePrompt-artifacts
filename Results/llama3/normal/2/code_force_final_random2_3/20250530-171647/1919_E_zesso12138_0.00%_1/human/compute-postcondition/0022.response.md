Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers with all elements equal to 0 except `dp[n]` which is 1, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers with all elements equal to 0 except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `(dp[j] + new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `new_dp[j - 1]` is `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. If `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_dp[j - 1]` is `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD. If dp[j] is greater than 0, then `new_dp` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `new_dp` remains unchanged, and `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. If `j - 1` is less than 0, `new_dp` remains unchanged.**
