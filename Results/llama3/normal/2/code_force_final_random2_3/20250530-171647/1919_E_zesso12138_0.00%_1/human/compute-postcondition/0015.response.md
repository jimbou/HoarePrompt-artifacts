The code prints the third result in the `results` list.
The `results` list contains at least three results of `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the integer value at `data[index]` and `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]`.
Since the exact `data` list and `func_1` function are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`.
However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the third result in the `results` list.
Output: **the third result in the `results` list (which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`)**
