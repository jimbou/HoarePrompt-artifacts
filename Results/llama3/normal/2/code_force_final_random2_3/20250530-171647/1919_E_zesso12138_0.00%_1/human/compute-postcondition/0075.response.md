Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `dp[j - 1]` is `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is not defined, `dp` is equal to the previous value of `new_dp`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `dp` is updated to be equal to the previous value of `new_dp`, which is a list of 2n+1 integers where each element is calculated based on the previous values of `dp` and `new_dp`. The values of `n`, `p`, `MOD`, `offset`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `new_dp` is no longer defined.
