Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `dp[j - 1]` is `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 zeros, and the current value of `j` is 2n.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `new_dp`, which is now a list of 2n+1 zeros, regardless of the previous values of `dp` and `j`.
