Output State: **`n` is the integer value at `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is `1 + n + 1 + ... + n` (t times), `results` is a list containing all results of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is equal to the initial value of `t`, `_` is `t-1`, `res` is the last result in `results`, and the last result in `results` which is `res` is being printed**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `p`, `index`, `t`, and `_` as in the initial state. However, `results` will now contain all the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and `res` will be the last result in `results`, which is being printed.
