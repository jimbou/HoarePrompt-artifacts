Output State: **n is the integer value at data[index], p is a list of n integers from data[index:index + n], index is 1 + n + 1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, p), t is at least 1, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value at `data[index]`. The list `p` now contains `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]`. The `index` has been incremented by `n + 1` to point to the next position in `data`. The `results` list now contains the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
