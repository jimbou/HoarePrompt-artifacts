Output State: **n is the integer value at data[index], p is a list of n integers from data[index:index + n], index is 1 + n + 1 + ... + n (t times), results is a list containing the results of func_1(n, p) for each iteration, t is equal to the initial value of t, _ is t-1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

* The value of `n` will be the integer value at the current index in the `data` list.
* The list `p` will contain `n` integers from the `data` list, starting from the current index.
* The `index` variable will have incremented by the total number of elements processed in all iterations, which is `n + 1` for each iteration, repeated `t` times.
* The `results` list will contain the results of applying the `func_1` function to the `n` and `p` values for each iteration.
* The value of `t` will remain the same as its initial value, indicating the total number of iterations.
* The loop variable `_` will have reached its final value, which is `t-1`.
