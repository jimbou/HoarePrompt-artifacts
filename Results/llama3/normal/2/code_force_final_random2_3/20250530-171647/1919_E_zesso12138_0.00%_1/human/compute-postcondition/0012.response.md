The `print(res)` statement will print the second result in the `results` list.
Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the second result in the `results` list.
Output: **the second result in the results list (where results is a list containing at least two results of func_1(n, p))**
