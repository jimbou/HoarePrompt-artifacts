Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `dp[j - 1]` is `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + new_dp[j + 1]) % MOD`, `j` is 0, and `n` must be at least 1. If `dp[j]` is greater than 0, `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + new_dp[j + 1]) % MOD` and if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_dp[j - 1]` is `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. If `dp[j]` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `new_dp`.***
