Output State: **n is the integer value at data[index], p is a list of n integers from data[index:index + n], index is 1 + n + 1 + n, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, p), t is at least 2, _ is 1**

The code snippet executes as follows:

1. `n = int(data[index])`: Assigns the integer value at `data[index]` to `n`. This overwrites the initial value of `n`.

2. `index += 1`: Increments `index` by 1.

3. `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`: Assigns a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]` to `p`. This overwrites the initial value of `p`.

4. `index += n`: Increments `index` by `n`.

5. `result = func_1(n, p)`: Assigns the result of `func_1(n, p)` to `result`. This is a new variable.

6. `results.append(result)`: Appends the result to the `results` list.

The final state is as follows:

- `n` is the integer value at `data[index]`.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]`.
- `index` is `1 + n + 1 + n`, which is the initial value of `index` incremented by `1` and then by `n`.
- `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `t` is at least 2, as it was not modified by the code.
- `_` is 1, as it was not modified by the code.
