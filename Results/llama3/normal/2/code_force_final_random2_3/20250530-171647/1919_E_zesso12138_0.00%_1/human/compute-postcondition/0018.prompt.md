You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, p is a list of integers of length n, and the elements of p are sorted in non-decreasing order.
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: n is the integer value at data[index], p is a list of n integers from data[index:index + n], index is 1 + n + 1 + ... + n (t times), results is a list containing the results of func_1(n, p) for each iteration, t is equal to the initial value of t, _ is t-1
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: `n` is the integer value at `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is `1 + n + 1 + ... + n` (t times), `results` is a list containing all results of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is equal to the initial value of `t`, `_` is `t-1`, `res` is the last result in `results`, and the last result in `results` which is `res` is being printed

```

Return Postconditions: `n` is the integer value at `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is `1 + n + 1 + ... + n` (t times), `results` is a list containing all results of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is equal to the initial value of `t`, `_` is `t-1`, `res` is the last result in `results`, and the last result in `results` which is `res` is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
