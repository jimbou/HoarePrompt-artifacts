Output State: **n is the integer value at data[index], p is a list of n integers from data[index:index + n], index is 1 + n + 1 + n, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, p) and the new result, t is at least 3, _ is 2**

The code block updates the values of `n`, `p`, `index`, and `results`. The first line assigns the integer value at `data[index]` to `n`, overwriting its previous value. The second line increments `index` by 1. The third line assigns a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]` to `p`, replacing its previous value. The fourth line increments `index` by `n`. The fifth line calculates the result of `func_1(n, p)` and assigns it to `result`. The sixth line appends `result` to the `results` list. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
