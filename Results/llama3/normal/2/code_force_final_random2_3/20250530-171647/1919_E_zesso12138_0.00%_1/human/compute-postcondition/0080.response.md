Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the binomial coefficient (n choose final_sum - offset) modulo MOD, where final_sum is the sum of the last element of list p and the positive integer n, and offset is equal to n. The function takes as input a positive integer n, a list of integers p of length n, and a constant integer MOD. The function initializes a list dp of size 2n+1 with all elements set to 0, except for the element at index n, which is set to 1. It then iterates n times, updating the list dp to contain the binomial coefficients (n choose j) modulo MOD for all j from 0 to 2n. Finally, it returns the binomial coefficient (n choose final_sum - offset) modulo MOD.**
