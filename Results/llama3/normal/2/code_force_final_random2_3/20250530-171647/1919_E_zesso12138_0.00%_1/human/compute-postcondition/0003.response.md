The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is the integer value at data[index], p is a list of n integers from data[index:index + n], index is 1 + n + 1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, p), t is at least 2, _ is 1**
