To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is at least 2.

To execute the loop again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. Since `t` is at least 2, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `n`, `p`, `index`, `results`, and `data` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is the integer value at data[index], `p` is a list of n integers from data[index:index + n], `index` is 1 + n + 1 + n, `results` is a list containing the result of func_1(n, p), `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2**
