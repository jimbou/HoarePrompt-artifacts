Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp[j]` is the binomial coefficient (n choose j) modulo MOD, `offset` is `n`, `i` is `n+1`, `final_sum` is `p[-1] + n`.**

In natural language, the output state is that a new variable `final_sum` has been introduced and assigned the value of the last element of the list `p` plus `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
