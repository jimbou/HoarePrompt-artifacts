The only variable in the loop head is variable `res`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results`. If `results` has at least 3 results the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 results, `res` is the second result in `results`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `results` must have at least 3 results and the `res` is the third result in the `results`.
State: **`n` is the integer value at `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is `1 + n + 1 + ... + n` (t times), `results` is a list containing at least three results of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is equal to the initial value of `t`, `_` is `t-1`, `res` is the third result in `results`**
