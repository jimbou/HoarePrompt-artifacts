    #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp[j]` is the binomial coefficient (n choose j) modulo MOD, `offset` is `n`, `i` is `n+1`.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `dp` now contains the binomial coefficients (n choose j) modulo MOD for all j from 0 to 2n. The other variables remain unchanged.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the binomial coefficient (n choose final_sum - offset) modulo MOD, where final_sum is p[-1] + n, offset is n, MOD is a constant integer, and n is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the binomial coefficient (n choose final_sum - offset) modulo MOD, where final_sum is the sum of the last element of list p and the positive integer n, and offset is equal to n. The function takes as input a positive integer n, a list of integers p of length n, and a constant integer MOD. The function initializes a list dp of size 2n+1 with all elements set to 0, except for the element at index n, which is set to 1. It then iterates n times, updating the list dp to contain the binomial coefficients (n choose j) modulo MOD for all j from 0 to 2n. Finally, it returns the binomial coefficient (n choose final_sum - offset) modulo MOD.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `p`. It calls the function `func_1` with `n` and `p` as arguments, appends the result to a list `results`, and repeats this process `t` times. Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.
