To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, and the elements of `p` are sorted in non-decreasing order, `t` must be at least 1, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 0**
