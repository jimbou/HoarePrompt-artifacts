Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers with all elements equal to 0 except `dp[j + 1]` which is `(dp[j] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `dp[j - 1]` is `(dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `offset` is `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(dp[j] + new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, otherwise `new_dp` is a list of 2n+1 zeros, and the current value of `j` is 2. If `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_dp[-1]` is `(new_dp[-1] + dp[0]) % MOD. If dp[j] is greater than 0, then the new_dp is updated accordingly, otherwise, new_dp remains unchanged. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD. If `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD. Otherwise, `new_dp` remains unchanged. `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD. If `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD. Otherwise, `new_dp` remains unchanged.***
