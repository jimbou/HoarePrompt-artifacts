The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `p`. It calls the function `func_1` with `n` and `p` as arguments, appends the result to a list `results`, and repeats this process `t` times. Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.
