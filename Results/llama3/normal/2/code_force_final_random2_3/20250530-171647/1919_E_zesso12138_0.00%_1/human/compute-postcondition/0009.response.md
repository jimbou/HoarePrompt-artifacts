The code prints the first result in the `results` list.
Since the exact `results` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the first result in the `results` list.
Output: **the first result in the results list (which is the result of func_1(n, p))**
