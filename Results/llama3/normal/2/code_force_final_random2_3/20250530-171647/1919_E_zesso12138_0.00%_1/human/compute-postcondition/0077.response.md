Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, `MOD` is a constant integer, `dp` is a list of 2n+1 integers where `dp[j]` is the binomial coefficient (n choose j) modulo MOD, `offset` is `n`, `i` is `n+1`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `dp` now contains the binomial coefficients (n choose j) modulo MOD for all j from 0 to 2n. The other variables remain unchanged.
