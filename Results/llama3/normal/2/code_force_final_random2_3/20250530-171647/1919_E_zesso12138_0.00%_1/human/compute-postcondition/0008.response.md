To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `res` and the list `results`. The loop will execute if `results` has at least one element. 

Given the initial state, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration. This implies that `results` is not empty if there has been at least one iteration. Since `t` is equal to the initial value of `t`, and `_` is `t-1`, it means there have been `t` iterations if `_` is not equal to `t`. However, since we cannot adjust the value of `_` or `t` directly, we focus on what we can adjust: the state of `results` and `res`.

For the loop to execute, `results` must have at least one element. This means there must have been at least one iteration of whatever process populates `results`. Since we cannot directly adjust `t` or `_`, we adjust our understanding of `results` to ensure it meets the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is the integer value at `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is `1 + n + 1 + ... + n` (t times), `results` is a list containing at least one result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is equal to the initial value of `t`, `_` is `t-1`, `res` is the first result in `results`**
