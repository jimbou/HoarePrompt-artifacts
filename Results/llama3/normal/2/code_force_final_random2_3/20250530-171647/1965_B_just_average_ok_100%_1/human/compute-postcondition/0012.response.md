Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is 20, stdin is empty, _ is 0, i is 21.**

The loop iterates over the list of numbers from 2^0 to 2^20. If a number is greater than k, the loop sets idx to the index of the previous number and breaks. If no number is greater than k, the loop iterates over the entire list and idx remains -1. In this case, since the loop executes all iterations, it means that no number in the list is greater than k, so idx remains -1. The loop also updates the variable i to the last index of the list, which is 20.
