Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is 0, _ is 1, i is 1**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 1, `idx` becomes 0. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. 

The initial state of `n`, `k`, `nums`, `_` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same as it is not modified after its value is used to calculate `idx`.
