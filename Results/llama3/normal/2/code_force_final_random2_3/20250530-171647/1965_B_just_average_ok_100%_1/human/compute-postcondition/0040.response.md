Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is -1, _ is 1, i is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `idx = i - 1` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 0, `idx` becomes -1. The second line, `break`, terminates the loop or control structure that this code is part of, but since we are only analyzing the provided code snippet, we don't have information about the surrounding control structure. Therefore, we can't determine the exact effect of the `break` statement.

The values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `_` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `i` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code snippet.

In summary, the code snippet only modifies the value of `idx`, setting it to -1, while leaving all other variables unchanged.
