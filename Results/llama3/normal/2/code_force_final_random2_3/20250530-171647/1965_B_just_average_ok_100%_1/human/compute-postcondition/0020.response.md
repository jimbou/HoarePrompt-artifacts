To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `nums` has at least one element. Since `nums` is a list of 21 integers, it already meets this condition. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be within the range of indices of `nums`.

State: **`n` is x, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, `idx` is -1, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 0, `i` is 0**
