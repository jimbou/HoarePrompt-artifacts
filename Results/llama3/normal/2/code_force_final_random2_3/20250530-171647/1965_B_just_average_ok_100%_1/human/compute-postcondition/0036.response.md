The only variables in the loop head are variables _ and input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the value returned by int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0 and input is empty. For the loop to execute again, _ must be 1 and input must not be empty and must contain a string that represents an integer greater than 1.
State: **`n` is x, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of 22 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^19 and three additional integers: `k` - 2^20, `k` + 1, and `k` + 2^20 + 1, `idx` is 20, `stdin` is not empty and contains a string that represents an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `i` is 21, and the length of the list `nums` which is 22 is being printed, and the list `nums` is being printed: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, `k` - 2^20, `k` + 1, `k` + 2^20 + 1]**
