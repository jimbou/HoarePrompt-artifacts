The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than `len(nums)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and `nums` is still a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20.
State: **n is x, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is -1, stdin is empty, _ is 0, i is 1**
