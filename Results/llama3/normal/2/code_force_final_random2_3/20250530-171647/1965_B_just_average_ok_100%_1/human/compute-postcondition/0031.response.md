Output State: **n is x, k is an integer, nums is a list of 22 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^19 and three additional integers: k - 2^20, k + 1, and k + 2^20 + 1, idx is 20, stdin is empty, _ is 0, i is 21**

Here's a description of the final output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains unchanged as `x`. The value of `k` is still an integer, but its exact value is not specified. The list `nums` initially contained powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, but after the code execution, it now contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^19 (since 2^20 was removed) and three additional integers: `k - 2^20`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^20 + 1`. The value of `idx` remains 20. The stdin is still empty, and the values of `_` and `i` remain 0 and 21, respectively.
