Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer, nums is a list of 23 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20 except 2^20, nums contains k - 2^20 + 1, k + 1, and k + 2^20 + 1, idx is 20, _ is the value of t, i is 21, and the length of the list nums which is 23 is being printed, and this is printed: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - 2^20 + 1, k + 1, and k + 2^20 + 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that the value of `_` is now equal to the value of `t`, which is the number of iterations. The values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, `idx`, and `i` remain the same as in the output state after 3 iterations.
