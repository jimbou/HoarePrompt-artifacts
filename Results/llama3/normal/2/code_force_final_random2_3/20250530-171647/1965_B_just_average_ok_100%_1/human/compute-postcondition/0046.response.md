Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, _ is 1, i is 2, idx is 1**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been updated to 1, which is the result of subtracting 1 from the value of `i` (2). The `break` statement does not affect any variables, so all other variables remain unchanged.
