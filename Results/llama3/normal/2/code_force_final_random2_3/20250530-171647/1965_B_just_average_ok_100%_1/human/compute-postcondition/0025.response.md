Output State: **n is x, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is 0, stdin is empty, _ is 0, i is 1**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`, making `idx` equal to 0. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are modified by the code.
