The code snippet consists of two lines: `idx = i - 1` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 0, `idx` becomes -1. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables.

Output State: **n is x, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is -1, stdin is empty, _ is 0, i is 0.**
