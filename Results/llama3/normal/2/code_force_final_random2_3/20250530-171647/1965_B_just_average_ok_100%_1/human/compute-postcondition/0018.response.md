To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `stdin` is empty. For the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to make it non-empty, so that `int(input())` can return a value.

Since the loop head only involves the variable `_` and the `input()` function, we can only adjust the state of `stdin`. We cannot adjust the states of other variables like `n`, `k`, `nums`, `idx`, `i`, etc., as they are not part of the loop head.

To make the loop execute again, we need to provide a new input value. Let's assume the new input value is an integer `x`. We can adjust the state of `stdin` to contain this new input value.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of 23 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^19 and three additional integers: `k - 2^20 + 1`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^20 + 1`, `idx` is 20, `stdin` contains the integer `x`, `_` is 0, `i` is 21**
