Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is -1, _ is 1, i is 21, and the length of the list nums which is 22 is being printed, and the list [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576] is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[i] > k:
        idx = i - 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is -1, _ is 1, i is 0. If nums[i] is greater than k, the program state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the program state is updated according to the else part which is not present in the code.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, `_` is 1, `i` is 1. If `nums[1]` is greater than `k`, then `idx` is 0. Otherwise, `idx` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, _ is 1, if nums[i] > k, then i is 2 and idx is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
