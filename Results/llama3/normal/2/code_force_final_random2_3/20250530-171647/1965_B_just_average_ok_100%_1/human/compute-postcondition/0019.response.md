Output State: **n is x, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is -1, stdin is empty, _ is 0, i is 21**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to `x`, which is the integer input from `stdin`. The value of `k` has been updated to an integer, but its specific value is not determined. The list `nums` now contains 21 integers, which are powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20. The variable `idx` has been updated to -1. The `stdin` is now empty, as the input has been consumed. The variables `_` and `i` remain unchanged, with `_` being 0 and `i` being 21.
