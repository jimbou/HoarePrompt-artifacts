The code snippet consists of two lines: `idx = i - 1` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 2, `idx` becomes 1. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed within. However, since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect.

Here is the final state of the variables after the code executes:

Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, stdin is empty, _ is 0, i is 2, idx is 1**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The only variable that is modified is `idx`, which is assigned the value of `i - 1`, resulting in `idx` being 1.
