Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is x, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is -1, stdin is empty, _ is 0, i is 21
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[i] > k:
        idx = i - 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is x, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is -1, stdin is empty, _ is 0, i is 0. If nums[i] is larger than k, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is x, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, stdin is empty, _ is 0. If nums[1] is greater than k, then idx is 0 and i is 1. Otherwise, the state of idx and i is not changed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is x, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, stdin is empty, _ is 0, if nums at index 2 is greater than k, then idx is 1, otherwise, no change in idx, and i remains 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
