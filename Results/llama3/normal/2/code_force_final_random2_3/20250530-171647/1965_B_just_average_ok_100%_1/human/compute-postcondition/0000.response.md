The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t pairs of integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n). So for the loop to be executed  the `input()` must be at least 1 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t pairs of integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n), input() must be at least 1, _ is 0**
