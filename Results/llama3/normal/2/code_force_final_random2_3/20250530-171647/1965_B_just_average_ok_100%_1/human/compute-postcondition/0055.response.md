Functionality: **This function generates and prints a list of 23 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20 except 2^20, and three additional numbers: k - 2^20 + 1, k + 1, and k + 2^20 + 1, where k is an integer input. The function takes two inputs: an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and t pairs of integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n). It iterates over each pair of inputs, generates the list of numbers, and prints the length of the list and the list itself.**
