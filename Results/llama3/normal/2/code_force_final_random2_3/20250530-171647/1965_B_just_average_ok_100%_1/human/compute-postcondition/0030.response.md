Output State: **n is x, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is 20, stdin is empty, _ is 0, i is 21**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 'idx' is set to 20, which is the index of the last element in the list 'nums' that is less than or equal to 'k'. The variable 'i' is set to 21, which is the length of the list 'nums'. The other variables remain unchanged.
