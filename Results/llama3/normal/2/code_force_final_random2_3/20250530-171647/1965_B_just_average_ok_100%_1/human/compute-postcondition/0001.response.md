The code block consists of four lines. The first line reads two integers from stdin, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`. Since stdin initially contains two inputs, after this line, stdin is empty. The second line creates a list of integers `nums` containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20. The third line initializes the variable `idx` to -1.

Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is -1, stdin is empty, _ is 0**
