Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t pairs of integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
    idx = -1
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > k:
            idx = i - 1
            break
    nums.append(k - nums[idx])
    nums.append(k + 1)
    nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
    nums.remove(1 << idx)
    print(len(nums))
    print(*nums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, nums is a list of 23 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^19 and three additional integers: k - 2^20 + 1, k + 1, and k + 2^20 + 1, idx is 20, stdin is empty, _ is 0, i is 21, and the length of the list nums which is 23 is being printed, and the following list of 23 integers is being printed: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, k - 2^20 + 1, k + 1, k + 2^20 + 1]

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is x, k is an integer, nums is a list of 22 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^19 and three additional integers: k - 2^20, k + 1, and k + 2^20 + 1, idx is 20, stdin is empty, _ is 0, i is 21, and the length of the list nums which is 22 is being printed, and the list nums is being printed: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, k - 2^20, k + 1, k + 2^20 + 1]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, nums is a list of 23 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20 except 2^20, nums contains k - 2^20 + 1, k + 1, and k + 2^20 + 1, idx is 20, _ is 1, i is 21, and the length of the list nums which is 23 is being printed, and this is printed: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - 2^20 + 1, k + 1, and k + 2^20 + 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
