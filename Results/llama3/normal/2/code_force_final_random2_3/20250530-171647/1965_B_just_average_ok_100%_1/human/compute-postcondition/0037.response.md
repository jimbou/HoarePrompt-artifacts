Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is -1, _ is 1, i is 21, and the length of the list nums which is 22 is being printed, and the list [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576] is being printed.**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `n` and `k`. Since `n` was initially `x`, its value is now an integer greater than 1. The value of `k` is also an integer. The second line reassigns `nums` to a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20. The third line sets `idx` to -1. The values of `_` and `i` remain unchanged. The length of the list `nums` which is 21 is being printed, and the list [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576] is being printed.
