The code snippet consists of two lines: `idx = i - 1` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is 2, `idx` becomes 1. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect.

Output State: **n is x, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, stdin is empty, _ is 0, idx is 1, i is 2**
