Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, nums is a list of 23 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20 except 2^20, nums contains k - 2^20 + 1, k + 1, and k + 2^20 + 1, idx is 20, _ is 1, i is 21**

The code snippet modifies the list `nums` by appending three new elements and removing one element. The first line appends `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`, which is equivalent to `k - 2^20` since `idx` is 20 and `nums[idx]` is `2^20`. The second line appends `k + 1` to `nums`. The third line appends `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`, which is equivalent to `k + 2^20 + 1`. The fourth line removes `1 << idx` from `nums`, which is equivalent to removing `2^20` since `idx` is 20.

The final state of `nums` is a list of 23 integers containing powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^20` except `2^20`, and the three new elements `k - 2^20 + 1`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^20 + 1`. The values of `n`, `k`, `idx`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
