The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than `len(nums)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of 21 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `nums` is still a list of 21 integers.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `nums` is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `idx` is either 0 or not set**
