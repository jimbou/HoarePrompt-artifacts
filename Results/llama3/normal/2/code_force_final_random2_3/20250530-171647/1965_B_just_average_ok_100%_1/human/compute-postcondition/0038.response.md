The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and nums, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list nums. If the length of the list nums is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, idx is -1, _ is 1, i is 21, and the length of the list nums which is 22 is being printed, and the list [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576] is being printed does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to the length of the list nums is greater than 0 and i is now 0.
State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is -1, _ is 1, i is 0, and the length of the list nums which is greater than 0 is being printed, and the list [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576] is being printed.**
