Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, nums is a list of 21 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, idx is 20, _ is 1, i is 21.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `idx` is updated to 20, which is the index of the last element in the list `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. The variable `i` is updated to 21, which is the length of the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged.
