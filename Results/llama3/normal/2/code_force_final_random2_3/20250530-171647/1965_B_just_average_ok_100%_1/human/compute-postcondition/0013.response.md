Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, nums is a list of 23 integers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^19 and three additional integers: k - 2^20 + 1, k + 1, and k + 2^20 + 1, idx is 20, stdin is empty, _ is 0, i is 21**

Explanation:
The code block modifies the `nums` list by appending three new integers and removing one existing integer. The `idx` variable is used to access the 21st element of the `nums` list (since indexing starts at 0), which is 2^20. The `k` variable is used in the calculations for the new integers.

The first line appends `k - 2^20 + 1` to the `nums` list. The second line appends `k + 1` to the `nums` list. The third line appends `k + 2^20 + 1` to the `nums` list. The fourth line removes the integer `2^20` from the `nums` list.

The other variables `n`, `idx`, `stdin`, `_`, and `i` are not modified by the code block. The `nums` list now contains 23 integers, including the original 21 powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^19, and the three additional integers calculated using `k` and the 21st element of the original `nums` list.
