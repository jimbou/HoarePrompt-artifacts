Postcondition: ***`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `no` is a list containing at least 3 integers `a`, and `i` is equal to the third integer `a` in the list `no`. If `i` is within the range of `min(less)` and `max(big)`, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
