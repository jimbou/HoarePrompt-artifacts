Postcondition: **loop is at least 1, iterable is 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, num is min(less) - max(big) + 1, x is an integer, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop. If x is 1, then big is a list containing innerLoop integers. If x is 2, then less is a list containing innerLoop integers a. If x is not 1 or 2, then no is a list containing innerLoop integers a. The current value of num is less than 1.**
