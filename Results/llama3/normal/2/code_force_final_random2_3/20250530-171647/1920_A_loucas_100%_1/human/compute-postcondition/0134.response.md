Output State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `no` is a list containing at least 2 integers `a`, and `i` is equal to the second integer `a` in the list `no`.**

The value of `num` is decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
