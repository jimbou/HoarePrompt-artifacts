Output State: **loop is at least 1, iterable is 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, num is min(less) - max(big) + 1, x is an integer, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop. If x is 1, then big is a list containing innerLoop integers. If x is 2, then less is a list containing innerLoop integers a. If x is not 1 or 2, then no is a list containing innerLoop integers a.**

The value of num is calculated as the difference between the minimum value in the list less and the maximum value in the list big, plus 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop. The lists big, less, and no are still defined based on the value of x.
