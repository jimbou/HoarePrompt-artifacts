Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 3. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `less`, `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` contains three integers which are `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` contains two integers which are `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists but `no` was a list containing the integer `a` before the execution of the code.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `x`, `a`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The only change is in the lists `less`, `big`, and `no`. If `x` is 1, `big` still contains two integers `a`, and `less` and `no` are still empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` now contains three integers which are `a`, and `big` and `no` are still empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` now contains two integers which are `a`, and `big` and `no` are still empty lists but `no` was a list containing the integer `a` before the execution of the code.
