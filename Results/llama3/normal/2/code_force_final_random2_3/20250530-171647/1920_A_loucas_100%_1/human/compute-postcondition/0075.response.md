Output State: **loop is at least 1, iterable is 1, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, x is an integer, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop, less is a list containing integers a, big is a list containing integers a, no is a list containing integers a, num is 0, i is undefined.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following properties:

- The loop will have executed at least once.
- The iterable will still be 1.
- The innerLoop will still be an integer.
- The iterable2 will be equal to innerLoop-1.
- The variable x will be an integer.
- The variable a will be an integer.
- The stdin will contain multiple test cases minus innerLoop.
- The less list will contain integers a.
- The big list will contain integers a.
- The no list will contain integers a.
- The variable num will still be 0.
- The variable i will still be undefined.
