Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *loop is at least 1, iterable is 1, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, x is an integer, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop, less is a list containing integers a, big is a list containing integers a, no is a list containing integers a, if the current value of num is less than 1, 0 is being printed and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the code inside the current loop continues to execute.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `less` is a list containing integers `a`, `big` is a list containing integers `a`, `no` is a list containing integers `a` that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`, `num` is decreased by 1. If the current value of `num` is less than 1, 0 is being printed and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the code inside the current loop continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `less` is a list containing integers `a`, `big` is a list containing integers `a`, `no` is a list containing integers `a` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `less` is a list containing integers `a`, `big` is a list containing integers `a`, `no` is a list containing integers `a` that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is one less than its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
