Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing three integers. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing two integers `a`. If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing two integers `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `big` has been updated to include the integer `a` if `x` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
