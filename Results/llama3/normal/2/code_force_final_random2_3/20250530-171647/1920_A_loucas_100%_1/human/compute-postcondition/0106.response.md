Postcondition: ***`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `num` is 0. If `x` equals 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 2, then `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` is a list containing one element which is `a` and `i` is equal to `a`.***
