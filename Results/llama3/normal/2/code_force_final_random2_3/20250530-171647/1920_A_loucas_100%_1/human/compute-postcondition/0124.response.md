Postcondition: ***`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `no` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, and `i` is equal to `a`. The current value of `num` is less than 1.***
