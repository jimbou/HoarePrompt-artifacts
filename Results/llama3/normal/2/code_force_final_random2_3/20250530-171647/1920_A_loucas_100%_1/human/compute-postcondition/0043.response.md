Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `no` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list. If `i` is between `min(less)` and `max(big)`, inclusive, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 2`. Otherwise, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been decremented by 1. If `i` is between `min(less)` and `max(big)`, inclusive, then `num` is now `min(less) - max(big) - 2`. Otherwise, `num` is now `min(less) - max(big) - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
