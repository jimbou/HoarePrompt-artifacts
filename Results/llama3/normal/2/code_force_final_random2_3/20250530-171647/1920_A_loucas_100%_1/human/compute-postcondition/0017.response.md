Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing one integer. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing two integers `a`. If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `num`, `x`, `a`, and `stdin` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the list `less`, which now contains two integers `a` if `x` is 2. The lists `big` and `no` remain unchanged.
