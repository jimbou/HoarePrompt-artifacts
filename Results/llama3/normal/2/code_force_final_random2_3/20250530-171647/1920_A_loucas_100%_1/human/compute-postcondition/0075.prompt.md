Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is at least 1, iterable is 1, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, x is an integer, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, i is undefined
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 1. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `less`, `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` contains one integer which is `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 2. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `less`, `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` contains two integers which are `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` contains one integer which is `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists but `no` was a list containing the integer `a` before the execution of the code.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 3. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing three integers `a`, `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` contains two integers which are `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` contains one integer which is `a` and `big` contains one integer which is `a` and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is not equal to 1, `big` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `less`, `no` are empty lists but `no` contains the integer `a`. If `x` is 2, `less` contains three integers which are `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` contains two integers which are `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists but `no` was a list containing the integer `a` before the execution of the code.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
