Postcondition: ***`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `no` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list. If `i` is between `min(less)` and `max(big)`, inclusive, then `i` is within this range. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
