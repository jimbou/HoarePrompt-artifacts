Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing one integer. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a`. If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.**

The code assigns the values of `x` and `a` from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or three, so after reading two integers, it now contains multiple test cases minus one. The values of the other variables are not affected.
