Output State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `num` is 0, `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `no` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, and `i` is equal to `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `x`, `a`, `stdin`, and `num` as in the initial state. The lists `less`, `big`, and `no` will contain `innerLoop` integers `a`, and `i` will be equal to `a`.
