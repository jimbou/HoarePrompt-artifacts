Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 3. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing three integers `a`, `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` contains two integers which are `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` contains one integer which is `a` and `big` contains one integer which is `a` and `no` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `big` has been updated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` now contains three integers, including the original two and the newly appended `a`. If `x` is 2, the value of `big` remains unchanged. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `big` now contains one integer, which is `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
