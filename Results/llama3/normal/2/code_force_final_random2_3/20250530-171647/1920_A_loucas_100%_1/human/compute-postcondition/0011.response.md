Output State: **loop is at least 1, iterable is 0, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is a list containing the integer a, num is 0, innerLoop is at least 1, iterable2 is 0, x is an integer not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the list 'no' now contains the integer 'a' which was appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three, since one test case was used to get the value of 'a'.
