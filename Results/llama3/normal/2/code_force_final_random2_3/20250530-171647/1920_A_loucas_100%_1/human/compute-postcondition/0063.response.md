Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 2. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `less`, `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` contains one integer which is `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `big` has been updated to include the integer `a` when `x` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of `big`, `less`, and `no` still depends on the value of `x`, but now `big` contains two integers `a` when `x` is 1.
