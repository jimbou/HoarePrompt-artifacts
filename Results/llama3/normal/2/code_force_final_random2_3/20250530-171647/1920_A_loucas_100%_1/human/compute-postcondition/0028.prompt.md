Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is at least 1, iterable is 0, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, num is 0, innerLoop is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *loop is at least 1, iterable is 0, innerLoop is at least 1, iterable2 is 0, num is 0, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or three. If x is 1, then big is a list containing one integer. If x is 2, then less is a list containing one integer a. If x is not 1 or 2, then no is a list containing the integer a.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing two integers. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing two integers `a`. If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing two integers `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing three integers. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing two or three integers `a` depending on the condition. If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing two or three integers `a` depending on the condition, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
