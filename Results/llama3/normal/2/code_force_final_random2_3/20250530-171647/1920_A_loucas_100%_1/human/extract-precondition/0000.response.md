Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing a single integer n (2 <= n <= 100) — the number of constraints. The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two integers a and x (a ∈ {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). a denotes the type of constraint. If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 500) — the number of test cases.**
