Output State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is at least 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 1. If `x` is 1, then `big` contains two integers which are the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` and `big` are empty lists, `no` is a list containing one element which is `a`, and `i` is equal to `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `big` has been updated to include the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` determines the contents of the lists `big`, `less`, and `no`. If `x` is 1, `big` now contains two integers, both equal to `a`. If `x` is 2, `less` contains one integer `a` and `big` contains one integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` contains one element `a` and `i` is equal to `a`.
