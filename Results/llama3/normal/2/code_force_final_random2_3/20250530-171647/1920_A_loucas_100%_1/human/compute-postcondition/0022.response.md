Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 3, `iterable2` is 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing two integers. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing two integers `a`. If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing two integers `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, and `num` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `a` are updated to the integers input by the user. The conditional statements regarding `big`, `less`, and `no` are still valid, but their values are now determined by the input values of `x` and `a`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by one.
