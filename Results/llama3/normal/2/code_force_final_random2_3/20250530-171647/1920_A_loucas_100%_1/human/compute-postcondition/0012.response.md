Postcondition: ***loop is at least 1, iterable is 0, innerLoop is at least 1, iterable2 is 0, num is 0, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or three. If x is 2, then less is a list containing one integer a, big is an empty list, and no is an empty list. If x is not 2, then less is an empty list, big is an empty list, and no is a list containing the integer a.***
