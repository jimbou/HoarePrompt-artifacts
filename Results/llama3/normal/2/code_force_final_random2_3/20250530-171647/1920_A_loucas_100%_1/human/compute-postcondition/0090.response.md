Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `less` is a list containing integers `a`, `big` is a list containing integers `a`, `no` is a list containing integers `a` that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `no`, `num` is one less than its previous value.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been decremented by 1, while the values of all other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, and the lists `less`, `big`, and `no` still contain integers `a`. The variable `i` is still the third element in the list `no`.
