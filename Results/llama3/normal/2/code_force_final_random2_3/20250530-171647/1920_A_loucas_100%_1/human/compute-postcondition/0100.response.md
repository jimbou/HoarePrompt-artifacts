Output State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is at least 0, `x` is 1, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `less` is an empty list, `big` contains one integer which is the value of `a`, `no` is an empty list, `i` is the last element in the list `no` which is undefined since the list is empty, `num` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `x`, `a`, `stdin`, `less`, `no`, `i`, `num` remains the same as the initial state. The only change is that the list `big` now contains one integer which is the value of `a`.
