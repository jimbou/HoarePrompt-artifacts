Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: loop is at least 2, iterable is 2, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, x is an integer, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop-1, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, i is the last element in the list no, num is 0
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is at least 0, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `num` is 0. If `x` is 1, then `big` contains one integer which is the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` and `big` are empty lists, `no` is a list containing one element which is `a`, and `i` is equal to `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is at least 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 1. If `x` is 1, then `big` contains two integers which are the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` is a list containing one element which is `a`, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing one element which is `a`, and `i` is equal to `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is at least 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 2. If `x` is 1, then `big` contains either two or three integers which are the value of `a`, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer `a`, and `no` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer `a`. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing either two or three integers `a`, `big` is a list containing either one or two integers `a`, and `no` is a list containing one integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` is a list containing either one or two elements which are `a`, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing one integer `a`, `no` is a list containing either one or two elements which are `a`, and `i` is equal to `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
