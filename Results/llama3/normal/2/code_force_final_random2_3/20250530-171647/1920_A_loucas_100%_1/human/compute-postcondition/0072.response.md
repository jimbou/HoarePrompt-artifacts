Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 3. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `less`, `no` are empty lists but `no` contains the integer `a`. If `x` is 2, `less` contains two integers which are `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists but `no` contains the integer `a`. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` contains one integer which is `a` and `big` is empty list, `no` contains the integer `a`.**

In this output state, the code has appended the value of `a` to the list `no`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of `no` has changed to include the integer `a` in all cases. The rest of the variables maintain their initial conditions.
