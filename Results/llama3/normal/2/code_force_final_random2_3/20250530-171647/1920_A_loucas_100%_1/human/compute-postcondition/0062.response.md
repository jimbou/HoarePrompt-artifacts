Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 2. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `less`, `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` contains one integer which is `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.**

In this output state, the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, and `iterable2` remain unchanged. The value of `x` and `a` are updated to the integers input by the user. The value of `stdin` is also updated to contain multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 2, since two inputs have been consumed by the `input().split()` function. The values of `big`, `less`, and `no` are updated based on the value of `x`.
