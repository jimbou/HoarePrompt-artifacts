Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *loop is at least 1, iterable is 0, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, num is min(less) - max(big) + 1, x is an integer, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop. If x is 1, then big is a list containing innerLoop integers. If x is 2, then less is a list containing innerLoop integers a. If x is not 1 or 2, then no is a list containing innerLoop integers a. If num is less than 1, 0 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the execution continues without any changes.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `no` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list. If `i` is between `min(less)` and `max(big)`, inclusive, then `i` is within this range. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `no` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list. If `i` is between `min(less)` and `max(big)`, inclusive, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 1`. Otherwise, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `no` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list. If `i` is between `min(less)` and `max(big)`, inclusive, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 2`. If `i` is less than `min(less)` or greater than `max(big)`, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
