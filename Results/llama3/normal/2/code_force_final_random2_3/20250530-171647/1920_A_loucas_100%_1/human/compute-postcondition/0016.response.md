Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `x` is 1, then `big` is a list containing two integers. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a`. If `x` is not 1 or 2, then `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.**

The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `big` is only defined when `x` is 1, the list `big` now contains two integers. The values of the other variables are not affected.
