Output State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is at least 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 1. If `x` is 1, then `big` contains one integer which is the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` and `big` are empty lists, `no` is a list containing two elements which are `a` and `a`, and `i` is equal to `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the list `no` has been updated. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `no` now contains two elements, both of which are equal to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
