Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `no` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, and `i` is equal to `a`. If `num` is less than 1, the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of the variables.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `no` is a list containing at least 1 integer `a`, and `i` is equal to the first integer `a` in the list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then the current value of `i` satisfies this condition. Otherwise, no specific condition is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `no` is a list containing at least 2 integers `a`, and `i` is equal to the second integer `a` in the list `no`. If `i` is within the range of `min(less)` and `max(big)`, the program state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the program state is not modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `no` is a list containing at least 3 integers `a`, and `i` is equal to the third integer `a` in the list `no`. If `i` is within the range of `min(less)` and `max(big)`, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
