Postcondition: ***`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 2. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `less`, `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` contains two integers which are `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` contains one integer which is `a` and `big` and `no` are empty lists but `no` was a list containing the integer `a` before the execution of the code.***
