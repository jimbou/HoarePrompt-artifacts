Postcondition: ***loop is at least 1, iterable is 0, innerLoop is at least 1, iterable2 is 0, num is 0, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or three. If x is 1, then big is a list containing one integer. If x is 2, then less is a list containing one integer a. If x is not 1 or 2, then no is a list containing the integer a.***
