Output State: **loop is at least 2, iterable is 2, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, x is an integer, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop-1, less is an empty list, big is an empty list, no is an empty list, i is the last element in the list no, num is 0**

In this output state, the value of innerLoop is updated to an integer value read from stdin. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop-1. The lists less, big, and no are reset to empty lists. The variable i is still the last element in the list no, which is empty. The variable num is reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
