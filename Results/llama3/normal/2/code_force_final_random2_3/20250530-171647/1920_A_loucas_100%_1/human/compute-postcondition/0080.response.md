Output State: **loop is at least 1, iterable is 1, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, x is an integer, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop, less is a list containing integers a, big is a list containing integers a, no is a list containing integers a, the current value of num is less than 1, i is undefined, and 0 is being printed, and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but the program skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
