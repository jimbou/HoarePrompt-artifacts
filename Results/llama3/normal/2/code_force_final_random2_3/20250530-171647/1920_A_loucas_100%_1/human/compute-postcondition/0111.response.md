Output State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is at least 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 1. If `x` is 1, then `big` contains one integer which is the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` is a list containing one element which is `a`, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing one element which is `a`, and `i` is equal to `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `num`, `x`, `a`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `less` is updated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `less` is still empty. If `x` is 2, `less` now contains two integers `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` now contains one element which is `a`. The values of `big` and `no` are also updated accordingly based on the value of `x`.
