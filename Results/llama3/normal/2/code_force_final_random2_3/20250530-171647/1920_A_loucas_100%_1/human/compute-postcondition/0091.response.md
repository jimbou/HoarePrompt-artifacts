Postcondition: ***`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `less` is a list containing integers `a`, `big` is a list containing integers `a`, `no` is a list containing integers `a` that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is one less than its previous value.***
