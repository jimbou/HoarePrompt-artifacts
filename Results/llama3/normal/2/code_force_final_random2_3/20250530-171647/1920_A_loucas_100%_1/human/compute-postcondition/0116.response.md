Output State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is at least 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 2. If `x` is 1, then `big` contains two integers which are the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` is a list containing one element which is `a`, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing one element which is `a`, and `i` is equal to `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, and `num` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `a` are updated to the two integers read from the input. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are updated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` contains two integers `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty. If `x` is 2, `less` contains two integers `a`, and `big` contains one integer `a`, and `no` is empty. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` contains one integer `a`, `big` is empty, `no` contains one integer `a`, and `i` is equal to `a`.
