Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `less` is a list containing integers `a`, `big` is a list containing integers `a`, `no` is a list containing integers `a` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `no`, `num` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `num` is decreased by 1, and the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
