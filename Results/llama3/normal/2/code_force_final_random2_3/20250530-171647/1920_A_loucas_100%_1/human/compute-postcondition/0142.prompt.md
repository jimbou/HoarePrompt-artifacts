Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing a single integer n (2 <= n <= 100) — the number of constraints. The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two integers a and x (a ∈ {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). a denotes the type of constraint. If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x.
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
    if num < 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    for i in no:
        if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
            num -= 1
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 0, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `no` is a list containing `innerLoop` elements, `i` is the last element in the list, and `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - (number of elements in `no` that are between `min(less)` and `max(big)`, inclusive), and the value of `num` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: loop is at least 1, iterable is 1, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, x is an integer, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop, less is a list containing integers a, big is a list containing integers a, no is an empty list, i is the last element in the list no, num is decreased by the number of elements in no that are less than or equal to the minimum value in less and greater than or equal to the maximum value in big, and the value of num is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `less` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `big` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, `no` is a list containing `innerLoop` integers `a`, and `i` is equal to the last integer `a` in the list `no`, and the value of `num` is being printed, where `num` is either 0 or `min(less) - max(big) - innerLoop + 1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
