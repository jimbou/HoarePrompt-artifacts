Postcondition: ***`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is at least 1, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 1. If `x` is 1, then `big` contains one integer which is the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing two integers `a` if `x` is equal to 2 in the if part, otherwise `less` is a list containing one integer `a`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` is a list containing one element which is `a` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2 in the if part, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing one element which is `a` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2 in the if part, otherwise `no` is a list containing two elements which are `a` and `a`, and `i` is equal to `a`.***
