Output State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `i` is the last element in the list `no`, `num` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `a` have been updated to the two integers read from the input, which was previously in `stdin`. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
