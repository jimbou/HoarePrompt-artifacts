The only variables in the loop head are variables  iterable and loop, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `loop`. If loop is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, loop is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) does ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `loop` is at least 1 and iterable is now 0. 
State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing a single integer n (2 <= n <= 100) — the number of constraints. The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two integers a and x (a ∈ {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). a denotes the type of constraint. If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x.**
