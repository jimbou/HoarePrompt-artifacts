Output State: **`loop` is at least 2, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is at least 2, `iterable2` is at least 2, `num` is 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 2. If `x` is 1, then `big` contains three integers which are the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, then `less` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `big` is a list containing two integers `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, then `less` is a list containing one element which is `a`, `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, `no` is a list containing one element which is `a`, and `i` is equal to `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `big` has been updated to include an additional integer `a`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions on `x` and the corresponding values of `big`, `less`, and `no` have also been updated to reflect the change in `big`.
