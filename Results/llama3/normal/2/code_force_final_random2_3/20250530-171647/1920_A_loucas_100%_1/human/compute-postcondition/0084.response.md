Output State: **`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is an integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop-1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop`, `less` is a list containing integers `a`, `big` is a list containing integers `a`, `no` is a list containing integers `a` that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `no`. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`. `num` is decreased by 1. If the current value of `num` is less than 1, 0 is being printed and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the code inside the current loop continues to execute.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `num` has been decreased by 1. If the new value of `num` is less than 1, the loop will skip the rest of the code and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop will continue to execute the code inside it.
