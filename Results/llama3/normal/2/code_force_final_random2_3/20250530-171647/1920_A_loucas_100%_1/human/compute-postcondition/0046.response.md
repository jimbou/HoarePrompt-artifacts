The code prints the value of `num`, which is calculated based on the elements in the list `no`, `min(less)`, and `max(big)`.
`num` is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) - (number of elements in `no` that are between `min(less)` and `max(big)`, inclusive)`.
Since the exact values of `min(less)`, `max(big)`, and the elements in the list `no` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `num`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `num`.
Output: **num (where num is min(less) - max(big) - (number of elements in `no` that are between `min(less)` and `max(big)`, inclusive))**
