#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing a single integer n (2 <= n <= 100) — the number of constraints. The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two integers a and x (a ∈ {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). a denotes the type of constraint. If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 500) — the number of test cases.
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: loop is between 1 and 500 (inclusive), iterable is loop-1, innerLoop is an integer, iterable2 is innerLoop-1, x is an integer, a is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus innerLoop, less is a list containing innerLoop integers a, big is a list containing innerLoop integers a, no is a list containing innerLoop integers a, i is the last integer a in the list no, and num is either 0 or min(less) - max(big) - innerLoop + 1, and the value of num is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of constraints. It then processes these constraints to determine the number of possible values for a variable 'k' that satisfy all the constraints. The function prints the count of possible values for 'k' for each test case.
