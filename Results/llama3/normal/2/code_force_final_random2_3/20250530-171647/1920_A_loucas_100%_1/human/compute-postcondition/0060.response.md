Postcondition: ***`loop` is at least 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `innerLoop` minus 1. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing one integer `a`, and `less`, `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` contains one integer which is `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists and `no` is a list containing the integer `a`.***
