Output State: **`a` is a list containing two strings, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `x` is an integer, `_` is 2, `range` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length. The length of the binary strings is equal to the integer. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0' for any `i` in `range(n - 1)`, then `s` is a string that is a concatenation of the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the rest of `a[1]`, and `x` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, `s` is a string that is a concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`, and `x` is equal to `n - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `t` which is assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, each with three inputs: an integer and two binary strings of the same length. The conditions for `s` and `x` also remain the same.
