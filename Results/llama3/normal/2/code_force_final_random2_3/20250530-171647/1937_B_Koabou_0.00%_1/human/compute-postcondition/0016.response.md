The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **a is a list containing two strings, n is an integer greater than 3, _ is 2, range is at least 2, i is 2**
