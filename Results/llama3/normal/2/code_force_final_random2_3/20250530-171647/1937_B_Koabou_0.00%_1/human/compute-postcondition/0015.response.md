Postcondition: **a is a list containing two strings, n is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, range is at least 2, i is 1. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. If a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', then s is a string that is a concatenation of the first i + 1 characters of a[0] and the rest of a[1], and x is equal to i. Otherwise, s and x remain unchanged.**
