Output State: **`a` is a list containing one string, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length. The length of the binary strings is equal to the integer, `_` is 0, range is at least 1**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains one string, which is the first input from the stdin. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, each containing three inputs: an integer, and two binary strings of the same length, where the length of the binary strings is equal to the integer, and `_` is 0, with a range of at least 1.
