Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the lexicographically smallest string is not a prefix of the first row. For example, consider the input:

3
2
10
01

The lexicographically smallest string is "010", but the program will output "100" as the smallest string, which is incorrect.

The issue is that the program only checks if the first row has a '1' followed by a '0' in the second row, and if so, it breaks and constructs the smallest string by concatenating the prefix of the first row with the suffix of the second row. However, this approach does not consider all possible cases, and it can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible paths and find the lexicographically smallest string among them.
