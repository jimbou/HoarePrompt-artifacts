Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list containing two strings, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `x` is an integer, `_` is 2, `range` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length. The length of the binary strings is equal to the integer. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0' for any `i` in `range(n - 1)`, then `s` is a string that is a concatenation of the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` and the rest of `a[1]`, and `x` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, `s` is a string that is a concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`, and `x` is equal to `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
        t = x - i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *a is a list containing two strings, n is an integer, s is a string, x is an integer and must be at least 1, _ is 2, range is at least 2, i is 0, t is x - i + 1 if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1], otherwise t is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length. The length of the binary strings is equal to the integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list containing two strings, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `x` is an integer and must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `range` is at least 2, `i` is 1. If the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` match the first `i + 1` characters of `s`, then `t` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `t` remains 1. The program continues to process the remaining test cases in `stdin`, each containing an integer and two binary strings of the same length equal to the integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *a is a list containing two strings, n is an integer, s is a string, x is an integer and is greater than 2, _ is 2, range is at least 2, i is 2. If the first i+1 characters of the first string in a match the first i+1 characters of s, then t is set to x - 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
