The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `range`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `range`. If `_` is less than `range`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `range` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 2 and `range` must be at least 2.
State: **`a` is a list containing two strings, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length. The length of the binary strings is equal to the integer, `_` is 2, range is at least 2**
