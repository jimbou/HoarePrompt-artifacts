Output State: **`a` is a list containing two strings, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length. The length of the binary strings is equal to the integer, `_` is 2, range is at least 2**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will contain two strings, which are the inputs read from the standard input during the two iterations of the loop. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop. The standard input `stdin` will have been consumed by four test cases, leaving multiple test cases minus four. Each remaining test case will still contain three inputs: an integer and two binary strings of the same length, where the length of the binary strings is equal to the integer. The loop variable `_` will have reached its final value of 2, and the `range` object will have been exhausted, having been iterated over at least twice.
