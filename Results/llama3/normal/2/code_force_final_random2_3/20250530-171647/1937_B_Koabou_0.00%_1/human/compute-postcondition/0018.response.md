Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two strings, n is an integer greater than 3, _ is 2, range is at least 2, i is 2. If the character at index i+1 of the first string in a is '1' and the character at index i of the second string in a is '0', then s is a string equal to the first i+1 characters of the first string in a plus the rest of the second string in a, and x is 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
