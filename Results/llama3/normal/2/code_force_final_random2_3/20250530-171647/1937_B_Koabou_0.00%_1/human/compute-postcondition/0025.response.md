To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(x):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i` and `x`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `x` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `x` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `x` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` is a list containing two strings, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `x` is an integer and must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `range` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `t` is `x - i + 1` if `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`, otherwise `t` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length. The length of the binary strings is equal to the integer.**
