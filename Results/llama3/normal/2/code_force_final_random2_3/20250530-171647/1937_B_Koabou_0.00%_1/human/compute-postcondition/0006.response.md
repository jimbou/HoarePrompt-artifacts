Output State: **`a` is a list containing three strings, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length. The length of the binary strings is equal to the integer, `_` is 2, range is at least 2**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains three strings because it initially contained two strings and one more string was appended to it from the input. The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function, so it now contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. The remaining test cases still contain three inputs each: an integer and two binary strings of the same length, which is equal to the integer. The value of `_` remains 2, and the range is still at least 2.
