Output: **a is a list containing two strings, n is an integer, s is a string, x is an integer, _ is 2, range is at least 2, i is x - 1, t is x - i if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1], otherwise t is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length. The length of the binary strings is equal to the integer, and the string s is being printed**
