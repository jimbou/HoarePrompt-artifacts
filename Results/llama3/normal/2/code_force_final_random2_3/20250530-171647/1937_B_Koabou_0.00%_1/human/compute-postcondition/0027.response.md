Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing two strings, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `x` is an integer and must be at least 2, `_` is 2, `range` is at least 2, `i` is 1. If the first `i + 1` characters of `a[0]` match the first `i + 1` characters of `s`, then `t` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `t` remains 1. The program continues to process the remaining test cases in `stdin`, each containing an integer and two binary strings of the same length equal to the integer.**
