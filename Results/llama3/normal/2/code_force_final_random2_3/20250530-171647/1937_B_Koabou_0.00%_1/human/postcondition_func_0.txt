This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and two binary strings of the same length. It then processes each test case to find the longest prefix of the first binary string that matches a suffix of the second binary string, and prints the resulting concatenated string and the length of the matching prefix. If no matching prefix is found, it prints the concatenation of the first binary string and the last character of the second binary string, along with a length of 1.
