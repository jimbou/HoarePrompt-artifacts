Postcondition: **a is a list containing two strings, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, s is an empty list, x is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length. The length of the binary strings is equal to the integer, _ is 2, range is at least 2, i is 0. The current value of a[0][i + 1] is '1' and the current value of a[1][i] is '0'.**
