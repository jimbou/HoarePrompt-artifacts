Output State: **`a` is a list containing two strings, `n` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length. The length of the binary strings is equal to the integer, `_` is 1, range is at least 1**

In this output state, the list `a` now contains two strings, where the second string is the input from the first test case that was not processed yet. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been processed, so there are three test cases less than before. The remaining test cases still contain three inputs each: an integer, and two binary strings of the same length, where the length is equal to the integer, and `_` is 1, and the range is at least 1.
