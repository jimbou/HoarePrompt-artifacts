Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two strings, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, s is a list, x is an integer, _ is 2, range is at least 2, i is 0. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length. The length of the binary strings is equal to the integer. If a[0][i + 1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0', then s is a string that is a concatenation of the first i + 1 characters of a[0] and the rest of a[1], and x is equal to i. Otherwise, s and x remain unchanged.***
