To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1.

State: **`a` is a list containing two strings, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `x` is an integer and must be at least 1, `_` is 2, `range` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases. Each remaining test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two binary strings of the same length. The length of the binary strings is equal to the integer.**
