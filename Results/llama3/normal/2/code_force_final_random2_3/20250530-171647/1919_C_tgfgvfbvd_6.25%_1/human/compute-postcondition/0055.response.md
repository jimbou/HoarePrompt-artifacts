Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `b` is `l[n]`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be equal to the `n`-th element of the list `l`, which is `l[n]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
