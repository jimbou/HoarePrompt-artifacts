Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than y + 1, l is a list of integers, a is the first element of l, b is either 0 or the first element in l that is greater than its predecessor, c is 0, y is an integer less than n, stdin is empty, _ is 2, and x is an integer in the range (y + 1, n). The current value of l[x] is greater than a and also greater than b. Additionally, the difference between l[x] and a is greater than or equal to the difference between l[x] and b.**
