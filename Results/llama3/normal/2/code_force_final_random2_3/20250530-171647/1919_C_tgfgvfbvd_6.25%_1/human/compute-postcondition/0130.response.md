The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `int(input())` is unknown but greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `n`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 2, `c` is an integer between 0 and `n - y - 1`. `a` and `b` are the maximum and minimum values in the list `l` from index `y + 1` to `n - 1` respectively, and the value of `c` which is an integer between 0 and `n - y - 1` is being printed**
