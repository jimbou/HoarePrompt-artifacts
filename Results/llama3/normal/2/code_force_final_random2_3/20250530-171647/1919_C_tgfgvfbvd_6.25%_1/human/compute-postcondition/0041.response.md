Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the value of `l[n]`, `b` is the value of the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, `c` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be the value of `l[n]`, which is the nth element in the list `l`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
