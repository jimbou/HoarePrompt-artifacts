Output State: **n is an integer greater than y + 2, l is a list of integers, y is an integer less than n, x is an integer in the range (y + 2, n), _ is 2, a is either the original value of a or l[x], b is l[x], c is either the original value of c or c + 1.**

In this output state, the value of b has been updated to l[x]. The value of a may or may not have been updated, depending on the original values of a, b, and l[x]. The value of c may or may not have been incremented, depending on whether l[x] is greater than both a and b. The values of n, l, y, x, and _ remain unchanged.
