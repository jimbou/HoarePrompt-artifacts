Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than y + 2, l is a list of integers, y is an integer less than n, x is an integer in the range (y + 2, n), and _ is 2. If l[x] is greater than both a and b, then c is increased by 1, and either a or b is updated to the value of l[x] based on the differences between l[x] and a, and l[x] and b. If l[x] is less than or equal to a or b, then either a or b is updated to the value of l[x] based on the differences between l[x] and a, and l[x] and b. If l[x] is less than a and b, then a is updated to the value of l[x] if the difference between a and l[x] is less than or equal to the difference between b and l[x]; otherwise, b is updated to the value of l[x].***
