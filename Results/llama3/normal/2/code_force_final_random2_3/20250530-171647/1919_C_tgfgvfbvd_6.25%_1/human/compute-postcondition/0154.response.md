Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `y` + 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the current value of `l[x]`, `b` is either 0 or the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor, `c` is 0, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `x` is an integer in the range (`y` + 1, `n`), and `_` is 2. The current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` and less than or equal to `b`. The difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be the current value of `l[x]`, which is less than or equal to the original value of `a` and less than or equal to `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
