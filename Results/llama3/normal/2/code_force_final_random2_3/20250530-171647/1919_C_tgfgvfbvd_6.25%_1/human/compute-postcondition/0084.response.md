Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 1`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. If the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. In both cases, `c` remains 0, and the current value of `l[x]` is greater than the previous values of `a` and `b`.***
