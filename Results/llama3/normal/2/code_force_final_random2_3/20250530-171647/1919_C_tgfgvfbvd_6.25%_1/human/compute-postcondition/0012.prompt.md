Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, l is a list of integers, a is the first integer in the list, b is 0, c is 0, y is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0
Code of the loop:
for y in range(1, n):
    if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
        b = l[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer greater than 1, l is a list of integers, a is the first integer in the list, if the second integer in the list is greater than the first integer, then b is the value of the second integer, otherwise b is 0, c is 0, y is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 2, l is a list of integers, a is the first integer in the list, if the third integer in the list is greater than the second integer, then b is the value of the third integer, otherwise b is 0, c is 0, y is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 3, l is a list of integers, a is the first integer in the list. If the fourth integer in the list is greater than the third integer, then b is the value of the third integer. Otherwise, b is 0. c is 0, y is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
