Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is either 1 or 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. `a` and `b` are updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is `l[n]` and `b` is updated based on the comparisons between `l[n]`, `a`, and `b`. Otherwise, `b` is `l[n]` and `a` is updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The values of `a` and `b` are still updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`, and the conditions for updating `a` and `b` are still the same.
