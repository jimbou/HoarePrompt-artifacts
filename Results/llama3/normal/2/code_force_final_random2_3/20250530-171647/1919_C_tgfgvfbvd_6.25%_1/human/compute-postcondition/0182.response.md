Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than y + 2, l is a list of integers, y is an integer less than n, x is an integer in the range (y + 3, n), and _ is 2. If the value of the element at index x in list l minus a is greater than or equal to the value of the element at index x in list l minus b, then a is the (x-th) element of list l. Otherwise, b is an integer in the list l at index x.***
