Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 3`, `a` is `l[y + 3]`, `b` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `b`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. If `l[x]` is greater than the previous value of `b`, then `b` is `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is the previous value of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` is updated to `l[x]`, which is `l[y + 3]`. The value of `b` is either updated to `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than the previous value of `b`, or remains the same as the previous value of `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
