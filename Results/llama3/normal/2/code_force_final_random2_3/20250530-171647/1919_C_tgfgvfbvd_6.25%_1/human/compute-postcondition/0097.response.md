Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 1`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. Either `l[x]` is not less than `a` or `l[x]` is not less than `b`. `a` is less than `l[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` is updated to be the value of `l[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` are still valid, and `a` is still less than `l[x]`.
