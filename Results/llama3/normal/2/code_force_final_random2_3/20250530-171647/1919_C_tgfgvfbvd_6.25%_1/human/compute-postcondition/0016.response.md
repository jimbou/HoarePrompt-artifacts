Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `y` is `n-1`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the value of `l[n]`, `b` is the value of the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. Additionally, the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be the value of `l[n]`, which is the current value of `l[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the relationships between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` are still valid, but now `a` is equal to `l[n]`.
