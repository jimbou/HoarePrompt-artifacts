Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`, `b` is `l[n]`, `c` is either 0 or 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be equal to the value of `l[n]`, which is the nth element of the list `l`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
