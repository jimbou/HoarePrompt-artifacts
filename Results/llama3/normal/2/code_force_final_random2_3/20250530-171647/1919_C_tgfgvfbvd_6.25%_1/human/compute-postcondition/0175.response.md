Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `y` + 2, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `x` is an integer in the range (`y` + 2, `n`), `_` is 2, `a` is either updated to `l[x]` or remains the same, `b` is `l[x]`, and `c` is either increased by 1 or remains the same.**

In this output state, the value of `b` is updated to `l[x]`, which is the value at index `x` in the list `l`. The value of `a` may or may not be updated depending on the differences between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `b`, either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on the differences between `l[x]` and `a`, and `l[x]` and `b`. The value of `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `y`, `x`, and `_` remain unchanged.
