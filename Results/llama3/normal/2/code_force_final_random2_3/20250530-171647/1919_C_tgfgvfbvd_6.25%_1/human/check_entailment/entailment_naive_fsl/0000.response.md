Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program splits the array into two subsequences, s and t, and calculates the penalty p(s) + p(t). The program uses a greedy approach to assign elements to s and t, always trying to minimize the penalty.

The program first initializes a and b to the first element of the array, and then iterates over the rest of the array. For each element, it checks if the element is greater than the previous element, and if so, it assigns it to b. If the element is less than both a and b, it assigns it to the one that results in a smaller penalty. If the element is greater than both a and b, it assigns it to the one that results in a smaller penalty.

The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element, and it also handles the case where the array has multiple elements. The program also correctly calculates the penalty p(s) + p(t) by counting the number of indices where the element is greater than the previous element.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
