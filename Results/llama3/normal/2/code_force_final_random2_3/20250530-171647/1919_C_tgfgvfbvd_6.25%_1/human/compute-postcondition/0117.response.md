Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 3`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1 or 2, `a` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `a`, and `b` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `b`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0 or 1, and either `a` or `b` is updated to `l[x]` based on their previous values and the difference between them and `l[x]`. Specifically, if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`.***
