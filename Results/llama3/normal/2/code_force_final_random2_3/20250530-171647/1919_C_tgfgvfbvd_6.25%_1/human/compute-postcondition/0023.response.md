Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `y` is `n-1`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is the value of the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `a` and less than `b`. Additionally, the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.***
