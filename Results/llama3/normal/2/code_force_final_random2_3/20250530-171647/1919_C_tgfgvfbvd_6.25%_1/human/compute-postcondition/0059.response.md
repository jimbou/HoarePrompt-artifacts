Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is either 0 or 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[n]`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[n]`.***
