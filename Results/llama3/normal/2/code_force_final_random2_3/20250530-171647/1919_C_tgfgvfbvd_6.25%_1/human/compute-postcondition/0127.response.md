Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `n`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. `c` is an integer between 0 and `n - y - 1`. `a` and `b` are the maximum and minimum values in the list `l` from index `y + 1` to `n - 1` respectively.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that `c` is an integer between 0 and `n - y - 1`, indicating the number of times the loop executed. The variables `a` and `b` are updated to be the maximum and minimum values in the list `l` from index `y + 1` to `n - 1` respectively. The other variables in the precondition, such as `n`, `l`, `y`, `stdin`, and `_`, remain unchanged.
