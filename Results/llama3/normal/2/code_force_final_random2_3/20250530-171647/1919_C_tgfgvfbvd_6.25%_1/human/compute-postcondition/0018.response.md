Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `y` is `n-1`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is the value of `l[x]`, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than `a`. The difference between `l[x]` and `a` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and the previous value of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be the value of `l[x]`, which is greater than `a`. The difference between `l[x]` and `a` is still less than the difference between `l[x]` and the previous value of `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
