Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than `y` + 2, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `x` is an integer in the range (`y` + 2, `n`), `_` is 2, and `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. Either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on the differences between `l[x]` and `a`, and `l[x]` and `b`. If `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `b`, then `a` is updated to the value of `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`; otherwise, `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `b`, then either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on the differences between `l[x]` and `a`, and `l[x]` and `b`.**
