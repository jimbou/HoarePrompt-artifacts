The only variable in the loop head is variable  x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `n`. If `x` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is `y + 1`, `y` is less than `n`, `n` is an integer. For the loop to execute again `x` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `x`. So `x` is `y + 2` and `n` is greater than `y + 2`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 2`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. `c` is either 0 or 1. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1, `a` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `a`, and `b` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `b`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0, and either `a` or `b` is updated to `l[x]` based on their previous values and the difference between them and `l[x]`.**
