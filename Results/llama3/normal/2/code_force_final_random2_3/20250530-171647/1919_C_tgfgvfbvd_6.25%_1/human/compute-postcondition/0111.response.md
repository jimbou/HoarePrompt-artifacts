Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 2`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1, `c` is either 0 or 1. Either `a` or `b` is updated to `l[x]` based on their previous values and the difference between them and `l[x]`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.***
