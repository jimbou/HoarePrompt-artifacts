Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than y + 1, l is a list of integers, y is an integer less than n, x is an integer in the range (y + 1, n), and _ is 2. If l[x] is greater than or equal to a, then a is updated to the value of l[x]. Otherwise, b is updated to the value of l[x], and a is strictly less than l[x]. In either case, c is 0.***
