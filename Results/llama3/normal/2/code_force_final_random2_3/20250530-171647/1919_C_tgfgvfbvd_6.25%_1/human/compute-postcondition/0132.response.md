To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `y` should be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer from stdin that must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers from stdin, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 1, stdin is empty, `_` is 2, `x` is no longer defined**
