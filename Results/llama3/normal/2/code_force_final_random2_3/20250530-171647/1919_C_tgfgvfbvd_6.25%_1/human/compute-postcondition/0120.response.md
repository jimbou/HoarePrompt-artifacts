Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 3`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, `b` is `l[x]`, `a` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `a` if `l[x]` is not greater than `a`, otherwise `a` is the previous value of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `l`, `y`, `x`, `stdin`, and `_` remains the same. The value of `b` is updated to be the value of `l[x]`. The value of `a` depends on whether `l[x]` is greater than the previous value of `a`. If `l[x]` is not greater than `a`, then `a` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `a`. If `l[x]` is greater than `a`, then `a` remains the same as its previous value. The value of `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, depending on the previous values of `a`, `b`, and `l[x]`.
