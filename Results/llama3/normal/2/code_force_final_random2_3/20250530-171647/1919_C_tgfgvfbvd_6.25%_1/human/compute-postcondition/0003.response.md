Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `_` is 0. The current value of `l[y]` is greater than the current value of `l[y - 1]`.**
