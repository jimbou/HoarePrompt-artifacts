Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first element of `l`, `y` is 2, stdin is empty, `_` is 2. If the third element of `l` is greater than the second element of `l`, then `b` is the third element of `l`. Otherwise, `b` is either 0 or the second element of `l`, and `c` is 0.***
