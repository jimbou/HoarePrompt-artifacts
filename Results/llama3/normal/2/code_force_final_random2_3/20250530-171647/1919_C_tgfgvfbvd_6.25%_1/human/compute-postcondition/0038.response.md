Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is the value of `l[x]`, `c` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be the value of `l[x]`, which is the x-th element in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `b` is now equal to `l[x]`, which is the same as the value of `l[n]` since `x` is equal to `n`.
