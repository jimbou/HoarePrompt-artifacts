Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is the value of `l[x]`, `c` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, `a` is the value of `l[n]`. Otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[n]` and `l[x]` is less than `b`. Otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[x]` and `l[x]` is less than `a`. If `l[x]` is greater than or equal to either `a` or `b`, or both, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `l[x]` and `b` is equal to `l[x]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be the value of `l[x]`, which is the value of the list at index `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `l[x]` are still valid, but now `b` is equal to `l[x]`.
