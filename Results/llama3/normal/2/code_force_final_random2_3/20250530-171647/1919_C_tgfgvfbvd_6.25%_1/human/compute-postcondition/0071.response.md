The only variables in the loop head are variables `y` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `y` and `n`. If `y` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1, so `y` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1, `x` is `n`. If `l[y]` is greater than `l[y - 1]`, then `b` is set to the value of `l[y]` and `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `b` and `c` remain 0, `y` is 2**
