To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for x in range(y + 1, n):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range of values from `y + 1` to `n-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `x` is an integer in the range `(y + 2, n)`. To execute the loop again, `x` must be incremented by 1.

The loop will execute again if `x` is still within the range `(y + 1, n)`. Since `x` is currently in the range `(y + 2, n)`, incrementing `x` by 1 will still keep it within the range `(y + 1, n)`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `x`, which should be incremented by 1.

State: **n is an integer greater than y + 2, l is a list of integers, y is an integer less than n, x is an integer in the range (y + 3, n), and _ is 2.**
