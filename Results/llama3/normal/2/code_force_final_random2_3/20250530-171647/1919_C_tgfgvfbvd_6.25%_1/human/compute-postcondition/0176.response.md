Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than `y` + 2, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `x` is an integer in the range (`y` + 2, `n`), and `_` is 2. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to the value of `l[x]`, `b` remains unchanged, and `c` remains unchanged. If `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `a` is either updated to `l[x]` or remains the same, `b` is updated to `l[x]`, and `c` is either increased by 1 or remains the same.***
