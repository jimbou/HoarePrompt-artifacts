Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to be the value of `l[n]` if `l[n]` is greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, or `a` is updated to be the value of `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` or `b`. If `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is updated to be the value of `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` or `b`, or `b` is updated to be the value of `l[n]` if `l[n]` is greater than or equal to `a` and `b`. In all cases, `c` is either 0 or 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0.***
