Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, l is a list of integers, a is the first element of l, b is either 0 or the first element in l that is greater than its predecessor, c is 0, y is n - 1, stdin is empty, _ is 2, and x is no longer defined.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than y + 1, l is a list of integers, y is an integer less than n, x is an integer in the range (y + 1, n), and _ is 2. c is increased by 1 if l[x] is greater than both a and b. If l[x] is greater than a and b, then a is updated to the value of l[x] if the difference between l[x] and a is greater than or equal to the difference between l[x] and b; otherwise, b is updated to the value of l[x]. If l[x] is less than or equal to a or b, then either a or b is updated to the value of l[x] based on the differences between l[x] and a, and l[x] and b. If l[x] is less than a and b, then a is updated to the value of l[x] if the difference between a and l[x] is less than or equal to the difference between b and l[x]; otherwise, b is updated to the value of l[x].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than y + 2, l is a list of integers, y is an integer less than n, x is an integer in the range (y + 2, n), and _ is 2. If l[x] is greater than both a and b, then c is increased by 1, and either a or b is updated to the value of l[x] based on the differences between l[x] and a, and l[x] and b. If l[x] is less than or equal to a or b, then either a or b is updated to the value of l[x] based on the differences between l[x] and a, and l[x] and b. If l[x] is less than a and b, then a is updated to the value of l[x] if the difference between a and l[x] is less than or equal to the difference between b and l[x]; otherwise, b is updated to the value of l[x].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than y + 2, l is a list of integers, y is an integer less than n, x is an integer in the range (y + 3, n), and _ is 2. If l[x] is greater than both a and b, then c is increased by 1, and if the value of the element at index x in list l minus a is greater than or equal to the value of the element at index x in list l minus b, then a is the (x-th) element of list l. Otherwise, b is an integer in the list l at index x. If l[x] is less than both a and b, then if a - l[x] is less than or equal to b - l[x], a is the (x + 1)th element of l. Otherwise, b is the (x+1)th element of list l. If l[x] is not less than both a and b, then if a is greater than or equal to the element at index x in the list l, a is the element at index x in the list l. Otherwise, b is the (x - 1)th element of l.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
