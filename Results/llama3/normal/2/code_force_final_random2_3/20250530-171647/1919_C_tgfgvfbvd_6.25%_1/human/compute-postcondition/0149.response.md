Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than y + 1, l is a list of integers, y is an integer less than n, stdin is empty, _ is 2, and x is an integer in the range (y + 1, n). If l[x] - a >= l[x] - b, then a is updated to the value of l[x], and the difference between l[x] and the previous value of a is greater than or equal to the difference between l[x] and b. Otherwise, b is updated to the value of l[x], and the difference between l[x] and a is less than the difference between l[x] and the old value of b.***
