To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 1. The state of `y` should be adjusted to be the first value in the range, which is 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 1, `x` is `n`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1**
