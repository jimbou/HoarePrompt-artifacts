Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 3`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is `l[y + 3]`, `b` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `b` if `l[x]` is not greater than the previous value of `b`. Otherwise, `b` is `l[x]`. If `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`, then `b` is `l[x]`, `a` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `a` if `l[x]` is not greater than `a`, otherwise `a` is the previous value of `a`.***
