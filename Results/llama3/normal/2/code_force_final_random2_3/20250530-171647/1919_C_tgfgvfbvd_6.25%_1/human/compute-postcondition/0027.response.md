Postcondition: **`n` is at least 1, `y` is `n-1`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is the value of the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. If the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, then `a` is equal to `l[n]` and the current value of `l[x]` is less than `b`. Otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[x]`, and the current value of `l[x]` is less than `a`.**
