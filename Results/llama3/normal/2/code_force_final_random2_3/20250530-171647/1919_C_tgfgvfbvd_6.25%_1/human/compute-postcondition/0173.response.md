Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than y + 2, l is a list of integers, y is an integer less than n, x is an integer in the range (y + 2, n), and _ is 2. If a - l[x] is less than or equal to b - l[x], then a is updated to the value of l[x] and b remains unchanged. Otherwise, a remains either its original value or is updated to l[x] based on the differences between l[x] and a, and l[x] and b, while b is updated to the value of l[x]. c is increased by 1 if l[x] is greater than both a and b.**
