Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than y + 2, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is an integer less than `n`, `x` is an integer in the range (y + 2, n), `_` is 2, `b` is equal to `l[x]`, `a` is either updated to the value of `l[x]` if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, or remains the same if `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `b`, or is updated to the value of `l[x]` if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `b` and the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` is updated to be equal to the value of `l[x]`. The value of `a` may be updated depending on the differences between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`. The value of `c` may be increased by 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `l`, `y`, `x`, and `_` remain the same.
