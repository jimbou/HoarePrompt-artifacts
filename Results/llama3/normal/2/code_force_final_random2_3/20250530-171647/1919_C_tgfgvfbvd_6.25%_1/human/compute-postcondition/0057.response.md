Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is `l[n]`, `b` is updated based on the comparisons between `l[n]`, `a`, and `b`, `c` is either 0 or 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` is updated to be the nth element of the list `l`, while the values of `n`, `y`, `x`, `l`, `b`, `c`, and stdin remain unchanged. The value of `b` is still dependent on the comparisons between the nth element of `l`, `a`, and `b`.
