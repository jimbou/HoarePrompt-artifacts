Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than y + 2, l is a list of integers, y is an integer less than n, x is an integer in the range (y + 3, n), and _ is 2. If l[x] is less than both a and b, then if a - l[x] is less than or equal to b - l[x], a is the (x + 1)th element of l. Otherwise, b is the (x+1)th element of list l. If l[x] is not less than both a and b, then if a is greater than or equal to the element at index x in the list l, a is the element at index x in the list l. Otherwise, b is the (x - 1)th element of l.***
