To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `y` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `y` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is either 0 or the second element of `l`, `c` is 0, `y` is 2, stdin is empty, `_` is 2, and `x` is no longer defined.**
