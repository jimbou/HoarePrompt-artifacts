Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` that is greater than the previous value, `c` is 0, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 1`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` or `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`. If the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`.***
