Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than y + 1, l is a list of integers, a is the first element of l, b is either 0 or the first element in l that is greater than its predecessor, c is 0, y is an integer less than n, stdin is empty, _ is 2, and x is an integer in the range (y + 1, n). Either l[x] is greater than or equal to a or l[x] is greater than or equal to b. Additionally, a is strictly less than l[x].***
