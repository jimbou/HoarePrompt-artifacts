Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences. The program iterates through the array, maintaining two variables `a` and `b` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values seen so far. It also counts the number of times a value in the array is greater than both `a` and `b`, which is the penalty. The program handles the cases where a value is less than `a` or `b` by updating `a` or `b` accordingly. The final count of penalties is printed for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
