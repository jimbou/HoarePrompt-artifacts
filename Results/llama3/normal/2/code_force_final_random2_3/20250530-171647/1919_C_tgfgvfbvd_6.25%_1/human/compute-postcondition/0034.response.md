Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `y` is `n-1`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[n]` and `l[x]` is less than `b`. Otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[x]` and `l[x]` is less than `a`. If `l[x]` is greater than or equal to either `a` or `b`, or both, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `l[x]` and `b` is equal to `l[x]`.***
