Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 2`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. `a` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `a`, and `b` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `b`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is `l[x]` and `b` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `b`. Otherwise, `a` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `a`, and `b` is `l[x]`.***
