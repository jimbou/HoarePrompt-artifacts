Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `y` is `n-1`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is the value of the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. Additionally, either `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a`, or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`, or both `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` and `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`. Moreover, `a` is less than `l[x]`.***
