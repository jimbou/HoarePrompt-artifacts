Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `y` is `n-1`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. Additionally, either `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a`, or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`, or both `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` and `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `l[x]` and `b` is equal to `l[x]`.***
