To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x`, `y`, and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `x` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is `y + 2`, and `y` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes `y + 3`.

The state of `y` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The states of other variables, such as `l`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `stdin`, and `_`, are not modified in the loop head, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 3`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1 or 2, `a` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `a`, and `b` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `b`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0 or 1, and either `a` or `b` is updated to `l[x]` based on their previous values and the difference between them and `l[x]`.**
