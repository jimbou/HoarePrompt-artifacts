Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` that is greater than the previous value, `c` is 0, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 1`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. Either `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b` or `l[x]` is not less than `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` has been updated to be equal to the value of `l[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l[x]` and `b` is still uncertain, but we know that `a` is now equal to `l[x]`.
