Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` that is greater than the previous value, `c` is 0, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 1`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than the previous value of `a` and `b`. Additionally, the difference between `l[x]` and the previous value of `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and the previous value of `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` has been updated to be equal to the value of `l[x]`, which is greater than the previous value of `a` and `b`. The differences between `l[x]` and the previous values of `a` and `b` are still maintained. All other variables remain unchanged.
