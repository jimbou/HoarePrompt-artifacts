Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `y` is `n-1`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is the value of `l[x]`, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `a`. The difference between `a` and `l[x]` is greater than the difference between `l[x]` and `l[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is at least 1, `y` is one less than `n`, `x` is equal to `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is now equal to the value of `l[x]`, `c` is 0, and there are multiple test cases minus 2 inputs in stdin. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `a`. The difference between `a` and `l[x]` is greater than the difference between `l[x]` and itself (which is 0).
