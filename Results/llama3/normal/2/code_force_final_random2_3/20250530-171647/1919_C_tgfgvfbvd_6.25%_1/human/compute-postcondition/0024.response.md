Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `y` is `n-1`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[n]`, `b` is the value of the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. The current value of `l[x]` is less than `b`. Additionally, the difference between `b` and `l[x]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `a` and `l[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` has been updated to be equal to the `n`-th element of the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `a`, `b`, and `l[x]` has also been updated, where `l[x]` is now less than `b`, and the difference between `b` and `l[x]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `a` and `l[x]`.
