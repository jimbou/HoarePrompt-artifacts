Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. If `l[x]` - `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]` - `b`, then `a` is the value of `l[n]`. Otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[x]`.**

The code increments the value of `c` by 1. Since `c` was either 0 or 1 initially, it is now either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables and the stdin remain unchanged.
