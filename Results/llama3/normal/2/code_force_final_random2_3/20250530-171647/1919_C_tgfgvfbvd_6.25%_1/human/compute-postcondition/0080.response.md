Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is an integer, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` that is greater than the previous value, `c` is 0, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 1`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `b`. Additionally, the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`.**
