Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, l is a list of integers, a is the first integer in the list, b is the value of the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, c is 0, y is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 1, `y` is `n-1`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is the value of the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, `c` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, `a` is the value of `l[n]`. Otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[n]` and `l[x]` is less than `b`. Otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[x]` and `l[x]` is less than `a`. If `l[x]` is greater than or equal to either `a` or `b`, or both, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `l[x]` and `b` is equal to `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 2, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then if the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, `a` is the value of `l[n]`. Otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, then if the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[n]` and `l[x]` is less than `b`. Otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[x]` and `l[x]` is less than `a`. If `l[x]` is greater than or equal to either `a` or `b`, or both, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `l[x]` and `b` is equal to `l[x]`. In all cases, `c` is either 0 or 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. `a` and `b` are updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, `a` is updated to `l[n]` and `b` is updated based on the comparisons between `l[n]`, `a`, and `b`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[n]` and `a` is updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, `a` is updated to `l[n]` and `b` is updated based on the comparisons between `l[n]`, `a`, and `b`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[n]` and `a` is updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is updated to `l[n]`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[n]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
