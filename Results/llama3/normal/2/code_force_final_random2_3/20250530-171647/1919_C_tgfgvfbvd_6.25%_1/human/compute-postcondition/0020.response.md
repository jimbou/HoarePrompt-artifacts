Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `y` is `n-1`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is the value of the first integer in the list that is greater than the previous integer, or 0 if no such integer exists, `c` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. The current value of `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. If the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, then `a` is the value of `l[n]`. Otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `c` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
