Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`, `c` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0, and the value of `c` which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n-1` is being printed**
