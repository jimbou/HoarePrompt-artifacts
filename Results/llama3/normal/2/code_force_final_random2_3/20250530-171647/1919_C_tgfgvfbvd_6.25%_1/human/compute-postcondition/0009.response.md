The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y and n. If y is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is 2, n is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, y must be increased by 1, so y is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 3.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than 3, l is a list of integers, a is the first integer in the list, if the third integer in the list is greater than the second integer, then b is the value of the third integer, otherwise b is 0, c is 0, y is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0**
