The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the range, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the range. If `_` is less than the range, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, the range is 2 less than the number of test cases. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again the range must be at least 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`, `c` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 1, and the value of `c` which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n-1` is being printed**
