Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is either 0 or 1 or 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. `a` and `b` are updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, `a` is updated to `l[n]` and `b` is updated based on the comparisons between `l[n]`, `a`, and `b`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[n]` and `a` is updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, `a` is updated to `l[n]` and `b` is updated based on the comparisons between `l[n]`, `a`, and `b`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[n]` and `a` is updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, `a` is updated to `l[n]`, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[n]`.***
