The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and the return value of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `int(input())`. If the return value of `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to the return value of `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, the return value of `int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0**
