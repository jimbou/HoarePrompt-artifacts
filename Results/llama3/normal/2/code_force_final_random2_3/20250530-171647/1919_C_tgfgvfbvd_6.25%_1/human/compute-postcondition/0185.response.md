Output State: **n is an integer greater than y + 2, l is a list of integers, y is an integer less than n, x is an integer in the range (y + 3, n), _ is 2, and b is the (x+1)th element of list l**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of n is still greater than y + 2. The list l still contains integers. The value of y is still less than n. The value of x is still in the range (y + 3, n). The value of _ is still 2. And the value of b is now the (x+1)th element of list l.
