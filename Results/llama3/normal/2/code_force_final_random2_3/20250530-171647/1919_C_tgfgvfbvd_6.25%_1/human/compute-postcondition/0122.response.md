Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `y + 3`, `a` is `l[y + 3]`, `b` is either `l[x]` or the previous value of `b`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, stdin is empty, `_` is 1. If `l[x]` is greater than both the previous value of `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1 or 2. If `l[x]` is not greater than both the previous value of `a` and `b`, then `c` is 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `a` is updated to `l[x]`, which is `l[y + 3]`. The value of `b` remains either `l[x]` or its previous value, depending on the comparison with `l[x]`. The value of `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, depending on the comparison of `l[x]` with the previous values of `a` and `b`. The other variables, `n`, `l`, `y`, `x`, `stdin`, and `_`, remain unchanged.
