The only variables in the loop head are variables  y and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `y` and `n`. If `y` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1, so `y` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **n is an integer greater than 3, l is a list of integers, a is an integer, stdin is empty, _ is 1, x is n, y is 3**
