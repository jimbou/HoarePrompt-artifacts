Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `y` is `n-1`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first integer in the list, `b` is `l[x]`, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0. Additionally, either `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a`, or `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`, or both `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` and `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`. Moreover, `a` is less than `l[x]`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be equal to `l[x]`, which is the value of the integer at index `x` in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the relationships between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` are still valid, and `a` is still less than `l[x]`.
