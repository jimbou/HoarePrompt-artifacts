The code prints the value of `c`, which is the number of times a value in the list `l` is greater than both `a` and `b`. Here, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, and `b` is the maximum value in the list `l`.

Since `a` is the minimum value and `b` is the maximum value in the list `l`, there are no values in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`. Therefore, the value of `c` is 0.

Output: **0**
