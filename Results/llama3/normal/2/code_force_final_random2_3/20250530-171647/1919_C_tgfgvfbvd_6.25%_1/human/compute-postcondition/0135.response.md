Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is either 0 or the second element of `l`, `c` is 0, `y` is 1, stdin is empty, `_` is 2, and `x` is no longer defined. If the second element of `l` is greater than the first element, then `b` is set to the second element of `l`. Otherwise, `b` remains 0.**
