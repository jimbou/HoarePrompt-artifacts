Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than y + 2, l is a list of integers, y is an integer less than n, x is an integer in the range (y + 2, n), and _ is 2. If l[x] is less than both a and b, then a is updated to the value of l[x] if a - l[x] is less than or equal to b - l[x]; otherwise, b is updated to the value of l[x]. If l[x] is greater than or equal to a, then a is updated to the value of l[x] and b remains unchanged. If l[x] is greater than a but less than or equal to b, then a is either updated to l[x] or remains the same, b is updated to l[x], and c is either increased by 1 or remains the same. If l[x] is greater than both a and b, then a is updated to the value of l[x] if the difference between l[x] and a is greater than or equal to the difference between l[x] and b; otherwise, b is updated to the value of l[x], and c is increased by 1.**
