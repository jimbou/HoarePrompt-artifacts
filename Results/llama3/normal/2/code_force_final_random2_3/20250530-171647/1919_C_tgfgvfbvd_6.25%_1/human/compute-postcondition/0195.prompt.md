Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = l[0]
    b = 0
    c = 0
    y = 0
    for y in range(1, n):
        if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
            b = l[y]
            break
    for x in range(y + 1, n):
        if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
            if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
            c += 1
        elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
            if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
        elif a >= l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `y` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are updated based on the comparisons between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b`, `c` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, _ is 0, and the value of `c` which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n-1` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is less than `n`, `x` is `n`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 1. `c` is an integer between 0 and `n - y - 1`. `a` and `b` are the maximum and minimum values in the list `l` from index `y + 1` to `n - 1` respectively, and the value of `c` which is an integer between 0 and `n - y - 1` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, l is a list of integers, a is the minimum value in the list l, b is the maximum value in the list l, c is the number of times a value in the list l is greater than both a and b, y is n - 1, stdin is empty, _ is 2, and x is no longer defined, and the number of times a value in the list l is greater than both a and b which is c is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
