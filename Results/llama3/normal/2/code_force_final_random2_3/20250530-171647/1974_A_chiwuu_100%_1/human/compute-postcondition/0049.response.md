Output State: **n is an integer between 0 and 10^4, i is n-1, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, t1 is an integer, if t is even then t1 is between -396 and 735, if t is odd then t1 is between -395 and 736, t is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains 0 lines. If t1 is greater than or equal to a, then t is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. If t1 is less than a, then t2 is an integer, if t is even then t2 is between -396 and 99, if t is odd then t2 is between -395 and 99. If t2 is a multiple of 15, then t is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. Otherwise, if t is even then t is between 1 and 25, otherwise t is between 2 and 26, and the value of t is being printed. If t1 is less than a and t2 is not a multiple of 15, then t is increased by 1. If t1 is less than a and t2 is a multiple of 15, then t is increased by t2 divided by 15. The value of t after the increments is being printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be between 0 and 10^4, `i` will be `n-1`, `a` and `b` will be between 0 and 99, `t1` will be an integer between -396 and 735 if `t` is even, and between -395 and 736 if `t` is odd, and `t` will be an integer between 0 and 99. The stdin will contain 0 lines. The value of `t` will be between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd, if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` will be an integer between -396 and 99 if `t` is even, and between -395 and 99 if `t` is odd. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, then `t` will be between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. Otherwise, if `t` is even then `t` will be between 1 and 25, otherwise `t` will be between 2 and 26, and the value of `t` will be printed. If `t1` is less than `a` and `t2` is not a multiple of 15, then `t` will be increased by 1. If `t1` is less than `a` and `t2` is a multiple of 15, then `t` will be increased by `t2` divided by 15. The value of `t` after the increments will be printed.
