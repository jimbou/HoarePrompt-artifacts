Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t` is between 0 and 49, if `t` is odd then `t` is between 1 and 50, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then the current state of the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is an integer between 0 and 99, if `t` is even then `t2` is between 0 and 396, if `t` is odd then `t2` is between 0 and 395. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is increased by 1.***
