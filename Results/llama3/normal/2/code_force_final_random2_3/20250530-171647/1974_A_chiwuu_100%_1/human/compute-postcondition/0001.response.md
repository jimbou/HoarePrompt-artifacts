According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains n lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). So for the loop to be executed  the variable `n` must be greater than 0 and i is now 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains n lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
