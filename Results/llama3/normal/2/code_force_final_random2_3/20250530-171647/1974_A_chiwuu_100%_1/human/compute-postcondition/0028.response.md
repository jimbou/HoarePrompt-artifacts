Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t2` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t2` is between -396 and 99, if `t` is odd then `t2` is between -395 and 99, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t` is even, then `t` is between 0 and 49. If `t` is odd, then `t` is between 1 and 50.**

In this output state, the value of `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, where `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, and `t1` is an integer that depends on whether `t` is even or odd. The range of `t2` is determined by the possible values of `a` and `t1`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-3 lines of input.
