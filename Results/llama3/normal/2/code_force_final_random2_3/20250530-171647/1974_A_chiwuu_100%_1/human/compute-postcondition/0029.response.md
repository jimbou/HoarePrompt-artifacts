Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t2` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t2` is between -396 and 99, if `t` is odd then `t2` is between -395 and 99, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t` is even, then `t` is between 0 and 49. If `t` is odd, then `t` is between 1 and 50.**

The value of `t` is updated by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 to it. The value of `t2` is divided by 15 and the result is rounded down to the nearest whole number, which is then added to `t`. The value of `t` is still an integer between 0 and 99. If `t` is even, it is between 0 and 49. If `t` is odd, it is between 1 and 50. The values of the other variables are not affected.
