Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t` is between 1 and 50, if `t` is odd then `t` is between 2 and 51, `t2` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t2` is between -396 and 99, if `t` is odd then `t2` is between -395 and 99, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

The code increments the value of `t` by 1 plus the integer division of `t2` by 15. Since `t2` is an integer between -396 and 99 if `t` is even, and between -395 and 99 if `t` is odd, the integer division of `t2` by 15 will be between -26 and 6 if `t` is even, and between -26 and 6 if `t` is odd. Therefore, the new value of `t` will be between 1 and 50 if `t` is even, and between 2 and 51 if `t` is odd. The values of the other variables are not affected.
