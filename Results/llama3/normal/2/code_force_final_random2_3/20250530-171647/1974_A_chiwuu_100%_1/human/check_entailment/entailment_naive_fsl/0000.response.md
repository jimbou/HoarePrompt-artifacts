Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. It first calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, and then checks if there is enough space left for the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the cases where the number of 1x1 or 2x2 icons is 0, and the cases where the number of 1x1 icons is greater than the number of 2x2 icons.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of 2x2 icons is odd, in which case it needs to be rounded up to the nearest whole number of screens.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
