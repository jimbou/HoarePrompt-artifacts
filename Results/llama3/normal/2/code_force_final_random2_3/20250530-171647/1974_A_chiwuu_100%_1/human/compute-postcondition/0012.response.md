Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t2` is an integer between 0 and 99, if `t` is even then `t2` is between 0 and 396, if `t` is odd then `t2` is between 0 and 395, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t` is even, then `t` is an integer between 0 and 49. If `t` is odd, then `t` is an integer between 1 and 50.**

In this output state, the value of `t2` is calculated as the difference between `a` and `t1`. Since `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, and `t1` is an integer between -396 and 735 (if `t` is even) or between -395 and 736 (if `t` is odd), the value of `t2` will be an integer between 0 and 99. Additionally, if `t` is even, `t2` will be between 0 and 396, and if `t` is odd, `t2` will be between 0 and 395. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
