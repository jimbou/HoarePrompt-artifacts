Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, t is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

The code reads a line from stdin, splits it into two space-separated integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The value of `t` is set to the value of `b`. The value of `n` and `i` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains one less line.
