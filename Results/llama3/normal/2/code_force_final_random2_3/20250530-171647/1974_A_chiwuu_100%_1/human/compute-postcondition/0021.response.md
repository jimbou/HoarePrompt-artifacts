The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t` is between 0 and 49, if `t` is odd then `t` is between 1 and 50, stdin contains n-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then the current state of the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is an integer between 0 and 99, if `t` is even then `t2` is between 0 and 396, if `t` is odd then `t2` is between 0 and 395. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is increased by 1, and the value of `t` is being printed**
