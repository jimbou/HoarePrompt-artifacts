The code prints the value of `t`, which is an integer. If `t` is even, it is between 0 and 49. If `t` is odd, it is between 1 and 50. The value of `t` is determined by the initial state of the program and the operations performed on it before the print statement is executed. Specifically, the value of `t` depends on the values of `t1` and `t2`, which are calculated based on the input from stdin and the current state of the program.

Output: **t (where t is an integer between 0 and 50, depending on whether t is even or odd and the operations performed on it)**
