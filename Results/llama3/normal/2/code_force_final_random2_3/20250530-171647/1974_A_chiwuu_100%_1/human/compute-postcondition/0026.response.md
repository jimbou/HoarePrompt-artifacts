Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t` is even, then `t` is between 0 and 49. If `t` is odd, then `t` is between 1 and 50.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t1` has been updated to be 15 times the value of `t` minus 4 times the value of `b`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged. The range of `t1` is still dependent on whether `t` is even or odd. The input in stdin remains the same, with n-3 lines containing two space-separated integers each.
