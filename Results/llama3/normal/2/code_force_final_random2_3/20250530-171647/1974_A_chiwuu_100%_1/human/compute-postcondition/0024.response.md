Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be `t // 2 + 1`, which means it is now an integer between 1 and 50 (since `t` was initially between 0 and 99). The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains n-3 lines, each with two space-separated integers x and y.
