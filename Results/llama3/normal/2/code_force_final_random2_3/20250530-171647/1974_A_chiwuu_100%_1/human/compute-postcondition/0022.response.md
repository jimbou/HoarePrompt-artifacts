Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^4, i is 1, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, t1 is an integer, if t is even then t1 is between -396 and 735, if t is odd then t1 is between -395 and 736, t is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

The code block reads two space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 99, their values remain within this range. The value of `t` is set to `b`, which is also an integer between 0 and 99. The value of `t1` is not modified by the code, so its range remains the same. The value of `n` is not modified by the code, so its range remains the same. The value of `i` is not modified by the code, so it remains 1. Stdin now contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
