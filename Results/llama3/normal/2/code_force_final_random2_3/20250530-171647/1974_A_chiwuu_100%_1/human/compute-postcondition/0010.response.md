Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t` is between 0 and 49, if `t` is odd then `t` is between 1 and 50, and the current value of `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the given code `t = t` does not change the values of any variables. It simply assigns the value of `t` back to itself, which does not have any effect on the program state.
