Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 10^4, i is 1, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, t1 is an integer, if t is even then t1 is between -396 and 735, if t is odd then t1 is between -395 and 736, t is an integer between 0 and 49, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t is divided by 2 and assigned back to t. The values of the other variables remain the same. The range of t is now between 0 and 49. The stdin still contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
