Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains n lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b
    if t % 2 == 0:
        t = t // 2
    else:
        t = t // 2 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t` is between 0 and 49, if `t` is odd then `t` is between 1 and 50, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then the current state of the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is an integer between 0 and 99, if `t` is even then `t2` is between 0 and 396, if `t` is odd then `t2` is between 0 and 395. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is increased by 1, and the value of `t` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains n-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t2` is between -396 and 99, if `t` is odd then `t2` is between -395 and 99. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, then `t` is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. Otherwise, `t` is between 1 and 50 if even, and between 2 and 51 if odd, and the value of `t` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains n-4 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t2` is between -396 and 99, if `t` is odd then `t2` is between -395 and 99. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, then `t` is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. Otherwise, if `t` is even then `t` is between 1 and 25, otherwise `t` is between 2 and 26, and the value of `t` is being printed. If `t1` is less than `a` and `t2` is not a multiple of 15, then `t` is increased by 1. If `t1` is less than `a` and `t2` is a multiple of 15, then `t` is increased by `t2` divided by 15. The value of `t` after the increments is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
