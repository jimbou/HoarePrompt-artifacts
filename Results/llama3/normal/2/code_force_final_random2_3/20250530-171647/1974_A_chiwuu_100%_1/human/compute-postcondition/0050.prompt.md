You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b
        
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: n is an integer between 0 and 10^4, i is n-1, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, t1 is an integer, if t is even then t1 is between -396 and 735, if t is odd then t1 is between -395 and 736, t is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains 0 lines. If t1 is greater than or equal to a, then t is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. If t1 is less than a, then t2 is an integer, if t is even then t2 is between -396 and 99, if t is odd then t2 is between -395 and 99. If t2 is a multiple of 15, then t is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. Otherwise, if t is even then t is between 1 and 25, otherwise t is between 2 and 26, and the value of t is being printed. If t1 is less than a and t2 is not a multiple of 15, then t is increased by 1. If t1 is less than a and t2 is a multiple of 15, then t is increased by t2 divided by 15. The value of t after the increments is being printed.

Return Postconditions: n is an integer between 0 and 10^4, i is n-1, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, t1 is an integer, if t is even then t1 is between -396 and 735, if t is odd then t1 is between -395 and 736, t is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains 0 lines. If t1 is greater than or equal to a, then t is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
