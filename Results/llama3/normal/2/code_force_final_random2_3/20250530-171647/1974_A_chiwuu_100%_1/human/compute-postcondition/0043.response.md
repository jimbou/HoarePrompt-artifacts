Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t2` is an integer, if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t2` is between -396 and -a, if `t1` is less than `a`, then if `t` is even then `t2` is between -396 and 99, if `t` is odd then `t2` is between -395 and 99, `t` is increased by `t2` divided by 15, stdin contains n-4 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `t` has been updated by adding the result of `t2` divided by 15 to it. The value of `t` is still an integer between 0 and 99, but its exact value has changed. The values of the other variables remain the same.
