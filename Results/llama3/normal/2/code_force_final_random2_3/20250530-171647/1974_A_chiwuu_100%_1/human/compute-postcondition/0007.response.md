Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If t is even, then t is an integer between 0 and 49. If t is odd, then t is an integer between 1 and 50.***
