Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 10^4, i is 2, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, t1 is an integer, if t is even then t1 is between -396 and 735, if t is odd then t1 is between -395 and 736, t is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains n-4 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If t1 is greater than or equal to a, then t is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. If t1 is less than a, then t2 is an integer, if t is even then t2 is between -396 and 99, if t is odd then t2 is between -395 and 99. If t2 is a multiple of 15, then t is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. Otherwise, t is between 1 and 50 if even, and between 2 and 51 if odd, and the value of t is being printed**

The code reads two space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively. The value of `t` is set to `b`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `n-4` lines, each with two space-separated integers. The ranges of `t1` and `t2` are determined based on the value of `t`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` is an integer, and its range is determined based on the parity of `t`. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, then `t` is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. Otherwise, `t` is between 1 and 50 if even, and between 2 and 51 if odd, and its value is being printed.
