Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t` is an integer between 0 and 24 if even and between 1 and 25 if odd, stdin contains n-4 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is between 0 and 24 if even, and between 1 and 25 if odd. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t2` is between -396 and 49, if `t` is odd then `t2` is between -395 and 50. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, then `t` is between 0 and 24 if even, and between 1 and 25 if odd. Otherwise, `t` is between 1 and 25 if even, and between 2 and 26 if odd, and the value of `t` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been divided by 2, resulting in a new range of values for `t`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `t1` and `t2` are still applicable, but the range of values for `t` has been updated. The value of `t` is being printed, and the stdin still contains n-4 lines of input.
