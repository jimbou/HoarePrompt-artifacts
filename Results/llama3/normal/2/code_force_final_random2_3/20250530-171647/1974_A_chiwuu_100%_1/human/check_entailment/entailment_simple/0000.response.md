Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop. The desktop consists of several screens, each represented as a grid of size 5x3. There are two types of application icons: 1x1 and 2x2.

The program first reads the number of test cases (n) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers (a and b) representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

The program then calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons (t). If the number of 2x2 icons is even, it calculates t as the number of 2x2 icons divided by 2. If the number of 2x2 icons is odd, it calculates t as the number of 2x2 icons divided by 2 plus 1.

Next, the program calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons (t1). If t1 is greater than or equal to the number of 1x1 icons (a), it means that all 1x1 icons can be placed on the same screens as the 2x2 icons, so the minimum number of screens needed is t.

If t1 is less than a, it means that additional screens are needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons. The program calculates the number of additional screens needed (t2) by subtracting t1 from a. If t2 is a multiple of 15 (the number of cells on a screen), it means that the remaining 1x1 icons can be placed on a whole number of screens, so the minimum number of screens needed is t plus t2 divided by 15. If t2 is not a multiple of 15, it means that an additional screen is needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons, so the minimum number of screens needed is t plus 1.

Finally, the program prints the minimum number of screens needed for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
