Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `t` is even, then `t` is an integer between 0 and 49. If `t` is odd, then `t` is an integer between 1 and 50.**

In this output state, the value of `t1` is calculated based on the given initial state. Since `t` can be either even or odd, the range of `t1` is also divided into two cases. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-1 lines of input.
