Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b
        
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: n is an integer between 0 and 10^4, i is n-1, a is an integer between 0 and 99, b is an integer between 0 and 99, t1 is an integer, if t is even then t1 is between -396 and 735, if t is odd then t1 is between -395 and 736, t is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains 0 lines. If t1 is greater than or equal to a, then t is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. If t1 is less than a, then t2 is an integer, if t is even then t2 is between -396 and 99, if t is odd then t2 is between -395 and 99. If t2 is a multiple of 15, then t is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. Otherwise, if t is even then t is between 1 and 25, otherwise t is between 2 and 26, and the value of t is being printed. If t1 is less than a and t2 is not a multiple of 15, then t is increased by 1. If t1 is less than a and t2 is a multiple of 15, then t is increased by t2 divided by 15. The value of t after the increments is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, calculates a value based on the second integer in each pair, and prints the calculated value. The calculation involves checking if the second integer is even or odd, performing arithmetic operations, and potentially incrementing the result based on the difference between the calculated value and the first integer in the pair. The function repeats this process for a number of pairs specified by the first integer read from standard input.
