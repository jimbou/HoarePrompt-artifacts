Based on the given initial state, the print statement will output the value of `t`, which is an integer between 0 and 99.

However, the value of `t` is further constrained by the conditions involving `t1` and `t2`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. If `t1` is less than `a`, then the value of `t2` comes into play. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, then `t` is between 0 and 49 if even, and between 1 and 50 if odd. Otherwise, `t` is between 1 and 50 if even, and between 2 and 51 if odd.

Since the exact values of `t1`, `t2`, and `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `t`. However, based on the constraints, we can describe the possible range of values for `t`.

Output: **t (where t is an integer between 0 and 99, with additional constraints based on the values of t1, t2, and a)**
