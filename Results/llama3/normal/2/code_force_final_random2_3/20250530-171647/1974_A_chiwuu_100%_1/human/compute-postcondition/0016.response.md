Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t1` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t1` is between -396 and 735, if `t` is odd then `t1` is between -395 and 736, `t2` is an integer between 0 and 99, if `t` is even then `t2` is between 1 and 396, if `t` is odd then `t2` is between 1 and 395, `t` is an integer, if `t` is even then `t` is between 1 and 50, if `t` is odd then `t` is between 2 and 51, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t2` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `t` has been updated to be between 1 and 51, depending on whether it was even or odd initially. The stdin still contains n-1 lines of input.
