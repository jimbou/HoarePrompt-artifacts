Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t` is an integer between 0 and 49 and the current value of `t` is an integer, stdin contains `n-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is halved and is now an integer between 0 and 49, and it is also an integer. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n-1` lines of input, each with two space-separated integers `x` and `y` between 0 and 99.
