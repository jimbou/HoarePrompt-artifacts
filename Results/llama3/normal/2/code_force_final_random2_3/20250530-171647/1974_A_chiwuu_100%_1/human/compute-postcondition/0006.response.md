Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 99, `b` is an integer between 0 and 99, `t` is an integer between 0 and 50 and is odd, stdin contains n-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to be half of its original value plus one, which results in an integer between 0 and 50. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-1 lines of input.
