Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` calculates the sum of a weighted sum of friendships, where each friendship is weighted by the product of the friendship value and a triangular number (k * (k + 1) // 2), and returns the result modulo a constant value MOD. However, this function does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should be calculated by considering the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion, which is not taken into account in `func_1`.

`func_2` reads the input data, calls `func_1` with the input data, and prints the result. Since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the expected value, the overall program does not produce the correct result.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
