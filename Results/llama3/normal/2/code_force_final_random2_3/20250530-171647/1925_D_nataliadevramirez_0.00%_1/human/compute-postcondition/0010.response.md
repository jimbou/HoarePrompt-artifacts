Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to the first integer from stdin, m is a non-negative integer equal to the second integer from stdin, k is a positive integer equal to the third integer from stdin, friendships is a list of m lists, each containing three positive integers a, b, and f such that a != b, 1 <= a, b <= n, and 1 <= f <= 10^9, t is greater than 0, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), stdin is empty, and the result of func_1(n, m, k, friendships) is being printed.**

The code block does not modify the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, or `result`. The first line assigns the values of the first three integers from stdin to `n`, `m`, and `k`, respectively. The second line assigns a list of `m` lists, each containing three positive integers, to `friendships`. The third line assigns the output of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` to `result`. Since stdin is empty after the execution of the code block, it is not included in the output state.
