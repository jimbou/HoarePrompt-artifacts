Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer such that m <= n*(n-1)/2, k is a positive integer, friendships is a list of m lists, each containing three positive integers a, b, and f such that a != b, 1 <= a, b <= n, and 1 <= f <= 10^9, t is greater than 0, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of three integers**

The code first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to n, m, and k, respectively. Then, it reads m lines from stdin, each containing three integers, and stores them in the friendships list. Finally, it calls the func_1 function with n, m, k, and friendships as arguments and assigns the result to the result variable. The value of t is not affected by the code.
