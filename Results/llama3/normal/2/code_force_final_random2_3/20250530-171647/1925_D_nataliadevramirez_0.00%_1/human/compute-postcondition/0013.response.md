Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to the first integer from stdin, m is a non-negative integer equal to the second integer from stdin, k is a positive integer equal to the third integer from stdin, friendships is a list of m lists, each containing three positive integers a, b, and f such that a != b, 1 <= a, b <= n, and 1 <= f <= 10^9, t is equal to 0, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), stdin is empty, and the result of func_1(n, m, k, friendships) is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are determined by the input from `stdin`, the value of `t` is 0 (indicating that the loop has finished executing), the result of the last execution of `func_1` is stored in the variable `result`, and the result of `func_1` is being printed. The state of other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
