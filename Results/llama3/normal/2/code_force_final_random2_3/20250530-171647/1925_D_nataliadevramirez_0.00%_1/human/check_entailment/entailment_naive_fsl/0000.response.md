Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not take into account the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.

In the problem description, it is mentioned that the teacher chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. This means that the probability of choosing a pair of friends is not constant and changes after each excursion.

The program calculates the result as the sum of the product of the friendship value and the sum of the first k natural numbers, which is not correct. The correct approach would be to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values by taking into account the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.

For example, consider the case where n = 2, m = 1, k = 2, and the friendship value is 1. The program would calculate the result as 1 * (2 * (2 + 1) // 2) % MOD = 3, which is incorrect. The correct result would be 1 * (1/2) + 2 * (1/2) = 3/2, which is not equal to 3.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
