Based on the initial state, the `print(result)` statement will print the output of the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`, where `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `friendships` is a list of `m` lists containing three positive integers each.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can't determine the exact output. However, we can describe the output as the result of the function `func_1` executed with the given inputs.

Output: **the result of func_1(n, m, k, friendships) (where n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, and friendships is a list of m lists containing three positive integers each)**
