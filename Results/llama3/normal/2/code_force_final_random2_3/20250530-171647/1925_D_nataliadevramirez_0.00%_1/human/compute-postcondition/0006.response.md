Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to the first integer from stdin, m is a non-negative integer equal to the second integer from stdin, k is a positive integer equal to the third integer from stdin, friendships is a list of m lists, each containing three positive integers a, b, and f such that a != b, 1 <= a, b <= n, and 1 <= f <= 10^9, t is greater than 1, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of n, m, and k have been updated to the values provided as input from stdin. The list of friendships has been populated with m lists, each containing three positive integers a, b, and f, which satisfy the given conditions. The result variable now holds the output of the function func_1, which was called with the updated values of n, m, k, and friendships. Stdin is now empty, as all inputs have been consumed. The value of t remains unchanged, as it was not affected by the code.
