Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The given program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. It iterates over each friendship, calculates the expected value of the sum of the friendship values for each pair, and adds it to the result. The expected value for each pair is calculated as `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`, where `f` is the initial friendship value, `k` is the number of excursions, and `MOD` is the modulo value.

However, this calculation is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair should be calculated as `f * k + (k * (k - 1) // 2) * (1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2))`, where `n` is the number of children. This is because the friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion, and the probability of choosing a pair of friends is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.

`func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` to calculate the result, and prints it.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
