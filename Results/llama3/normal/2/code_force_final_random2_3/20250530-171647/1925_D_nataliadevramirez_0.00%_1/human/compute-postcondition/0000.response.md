Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer such that `m` <= `n`*(`n`-1)/2, `k` is a positive integer, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `f` such that `a` != `b`, 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n`, and 1 <= `f` <= 10^9, `t` is an integer.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is the addition of a new variable `t`, which is assigned the value of the integer input from the user. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to input the value of `t`.
