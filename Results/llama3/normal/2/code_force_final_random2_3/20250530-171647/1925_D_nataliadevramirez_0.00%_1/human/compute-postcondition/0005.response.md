The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, t must be greater than 1.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer such that m <= n*(n-1)/2, k is a positive integer, friendships is a list of m lists, each containing three positive integers a, b, and f such that a != b, 1 <= a, b <= n, and 1 <= f <= 10^9, t is greater than 1, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, friendships), stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of three integers, and the result of func_1(n, m, k, friendships) is being printed**
