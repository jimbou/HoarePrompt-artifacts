Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate this expected value, which takes the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, the number of excursions `k`, and a list of friendships as input.

The function `func_1` iterates over each pair of friends, calculates the expected value of the sum of their friendship values for all k excursions, and adds this value to the total result. The expected value is calculated as `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`, where `f` is the initial friendship value, `k` is the number of excursions, and `MOD` is a constant value.

The function `func_2` reads the input from the standard input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the result.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values, and it handles the input and output correctly.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program assumes that the probability of choosing a pair of friends is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`, which is not correct. The correct probability is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)` for the first excursion, but it changes for subsequent excursions because the friendship value of the chosen pair increases by 1.

To fix this error, the program needs to calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends for each excursion, taking into account the increased friendship value of the chosen pair.

Correctness: **False**
