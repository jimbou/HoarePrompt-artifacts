The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `m` where `m <= n*(n-1)/2`, a positive integer `k`, and a list of `m` lists `friendships` where each sublist contains three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `f` such that `a != b`, `1 <= a, b <= n`, and `1 <= f <= 10^9`. The function returns a result, which is then printed. The function does not modify the input variables `n`, `m`, `k`, or `friendships`. The purpose of the function is to process the input data and produce an output based on the given parameters and friendships list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the result of the function is being printed, and the input variables remain unchanged.
