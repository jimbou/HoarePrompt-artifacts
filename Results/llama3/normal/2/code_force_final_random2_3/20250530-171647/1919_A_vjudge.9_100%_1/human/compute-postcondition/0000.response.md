The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) â€” the number of test cases. So `t` is assigned the value of this integer. The remaining lines in stdin contain two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) â€” the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
