Reasoning:

The problem can be solved by analyzing the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the difference is even, Bob will win; otherwise, Alice will win.

The provided Python program correctly implements this logic. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, `a` and `b`, respectively. It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the result is 0, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

The program's logic is correct because the game's outcome depends on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in the wallets. If the difference is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he will win. If the difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of coins, forcing him to lose.

Therefore, the program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the input values.

Correctness: **True**
