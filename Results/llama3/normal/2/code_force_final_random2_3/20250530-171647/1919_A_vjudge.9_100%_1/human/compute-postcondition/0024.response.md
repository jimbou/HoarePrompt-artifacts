Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is `t-1`, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and are assigned the values of the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), minus `t` lines of input that have been read. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than the initial value of `t`, and the values of `a` and `b` will be the last two integers read from the input. The input will have `t` lines of input removed, and the output will be either 'Bob' or 'Alice' depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
