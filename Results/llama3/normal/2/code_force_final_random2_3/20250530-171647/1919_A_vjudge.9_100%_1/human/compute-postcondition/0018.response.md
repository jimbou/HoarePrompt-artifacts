Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and are assigned the values of the next two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), minus one line of input that has been read.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the next two integers from the input, which are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but one line has been read and is no longer available.
