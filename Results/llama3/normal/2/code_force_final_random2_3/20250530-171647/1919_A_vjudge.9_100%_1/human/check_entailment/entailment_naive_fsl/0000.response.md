Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly determines the winner of the game based on the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the player who wins is the one who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets.

The program uses the fact that if the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets is even, then Bob will win, and if the difference is odd, then Alice will win. This is because the players take turns removing one coin from their wallet, and the player who removes the last coin wins.

The program correctly implements this logic by using the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the absolute difference between the number of coins in the two wallets is even or odd. If it is even, it prints "Bob", and if it is odd, it prints "Alice".

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
