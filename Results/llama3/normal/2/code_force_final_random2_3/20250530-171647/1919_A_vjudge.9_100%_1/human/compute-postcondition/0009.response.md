Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' is printed. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'Alice' is printed.***
