Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input, which are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), but the first line has been consumed by the input operation.
