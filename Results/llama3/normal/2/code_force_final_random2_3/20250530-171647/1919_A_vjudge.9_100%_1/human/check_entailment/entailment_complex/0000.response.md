Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem description states that the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses, and the program correctly determines the winner based on whether the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd.

The program uses the fact that if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, then Bob will win, and if it is odd, then Alice will win. This is because if the difference is even, then Alice will always be able to make a move, and if the difference is odd, then Bob will always be able to make a move.

The program correctly reads the input, calculates the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, and prints the winner's name based on whether the difference is even or odd.

Correctness: **True**
