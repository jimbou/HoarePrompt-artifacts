Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The key observation is that the player who wins is the one who can make the last move, which happens when the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets is even.

The provided program uses this observation to determine the winner. It calculates the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and checks if it is even. If it is, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

The program correctly implements this logic and handles all possible inputs. It reads the number of test cases, iterates over each test case, reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, and prints the winner based on the calculated difference.

Correctness: **True**
