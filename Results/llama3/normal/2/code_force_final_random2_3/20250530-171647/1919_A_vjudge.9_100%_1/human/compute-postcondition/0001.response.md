The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) does ensure that the loop will execute , so it does not need to be adjusted. However, `i` is not defined before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
