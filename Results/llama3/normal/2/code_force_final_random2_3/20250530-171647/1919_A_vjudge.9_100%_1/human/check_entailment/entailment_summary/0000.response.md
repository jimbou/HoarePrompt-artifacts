Reasoning:
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The program correctly checks if the absolute difference is even or odd and prints the corresponding winner's name.

The logic behind the program is sound. If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, Bob will win. This is because, regardless of the moves made by Alice and Bob, the difference between the number of coins in their wallets will always remain even. Therefore, when the difference becomes 0, it will be Bob's turn, and he will lose.

On the other hand, if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is odd, Alice will win. This is because, regardless of the moves made by Alice and Bob, the difference between the number of coins in their wallets will always remain odd. Therefore, when the difference becomes 0, it will be Alice's turn, and she will win.

The program correctly implements this logic and prints the winner's name for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
