Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.***
