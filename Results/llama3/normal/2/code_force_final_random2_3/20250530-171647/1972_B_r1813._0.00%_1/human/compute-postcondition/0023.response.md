The code prints the second result in the list `results`. The `results` list contains strings 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd or even. Since `result` is the second result in the list, it will be either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the count of 'U' in the second string.

Output: **'YES' if the count of 'U' in the second string is odd, otherwise 'NO'**
