To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its state doesn't affect the loop's execution. The loop's execution depends on the value of `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Since `t` is already a positive integer, we can conclude that `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **stdin is empty, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings containing the test cases**
