Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the second element of the data list, `index` is 3, `s` is a string equal to the third element of the data list, `num_up_coins` is an odd integer equal to the count of 'U' in the string `s`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES', `data` is a list of strings containing the test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `index`, `s`, `num_up_coins`, `t`, and `data` remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `results` now contains the string 'YES'.
