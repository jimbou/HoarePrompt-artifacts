Output State: **stdin is empty, t is a positive integer, index is 1, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings containing the test cases**

The code reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, which is stored in the `data` variable. The first element of `data` is converted to an integer and stored in `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The `index` variable is incremented to 1, pointing to the next element in `data`. The `results` list is initialized as an empty list. Stdin is now empty since all its content has been read.
