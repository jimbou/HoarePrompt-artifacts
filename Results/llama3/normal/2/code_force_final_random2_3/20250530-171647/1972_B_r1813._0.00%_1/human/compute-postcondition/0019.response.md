According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results. If the list has at least 1 result the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, index is equal to 2t+1. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 result and the result is the first result in the list.
State: **`index` is equal to 2t+1, results is a list of strings containing 'YES' if the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd, otherwise 'NO', results must have at least 1 result, result is the first result in the list**
