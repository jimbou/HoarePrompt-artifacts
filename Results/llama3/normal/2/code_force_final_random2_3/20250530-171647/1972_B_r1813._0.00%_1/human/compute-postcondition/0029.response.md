Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". It then determines whether the count of "U" in each string is odd or even and prints "YES" if it's odd, and "NO" if it's even, for each test case. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
