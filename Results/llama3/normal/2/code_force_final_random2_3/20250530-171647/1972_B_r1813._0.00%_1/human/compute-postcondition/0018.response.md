Output State: **index is equal to 2t+1, results is a list of strings containing 'YES' if the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd, otherwise 'NO'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the index variable is equal to 2 times the initial value of t plus 1, and the results list contains 'YES' if the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd, otherwise 'NO'. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
