Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, t is a positive integer, index is 1, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings containing the test cases
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    s = data[index]
    index += 1
    num_up_coins = s.count('U')
    if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer equal to the second element of the data list, index is 3, s is a string equal to the third element of the data list, t is a positive integer greater than 0, data is a list of strings containing the test cases. If the count of 'U' in the string s is odd, then results is a list containing the string 'YES'. Otherwise, results is a list containing the string 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the third element of the data list, `index` is 5, `s` is a string equal to the fourth element of the data list, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings containing the test cases, `num_up_coins` is an integer equal to the count of 'U' in the fourth element of the data list. If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' and 'YES'. If `num_up_coins` is even, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO' and 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer equal to the fourth element of the data list, index is 7, s is a string equal to the fifth element of the data list, t is a positive integer greater than 1, data is a list of strings containing the test cases, num_up_coins is an integer equal to the count of 'U' in the fifth element of the data list, results is a list containing the string 'YES' if num_up_coins is odd, otherwise 'NO'. If num_up_coins is odd, 'YES' is appended to the results list. If num_up_coins is even, 'NO' is appended to the results list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
