The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **n is an integer equal to the second element of the data list, index is 3, s is a string equal to the third element of the data list, t is a positive integer greater than 0, data is a list of strings containing the test cases. If the count of 'U' in the string s is odd, then results is a list containing the string 'YES'. Otherwise, results is a list containing the string 'NO'.**
