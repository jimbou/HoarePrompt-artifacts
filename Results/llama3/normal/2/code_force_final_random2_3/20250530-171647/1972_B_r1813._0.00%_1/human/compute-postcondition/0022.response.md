The only variable in the loop head is variable  result and list results, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results.  If the list has at least 2 results the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, results has at least 1 result, result is the first result in the list, and the first result in the list which is either 'YES' or 'NO' is being printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 results and the result is the second result in the list.
State: **`index` is equal to 2t+1, results is a list of strings containing 'YES' if the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd, otherwise 'NO', results must have at least 2 results, result is the second result in the list**
