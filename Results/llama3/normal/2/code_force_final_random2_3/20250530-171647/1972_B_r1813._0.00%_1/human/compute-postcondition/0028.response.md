Output State: **index is equal to 2t+1, results is a list of strings containing 'YES' if the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd, otherwise 'NO', results must have at least n results, result is the nth result in the list, and the nth result in the list which is either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, and the result which is either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the index remains unchanged, the results list still contains strings indicating whether the count of 'U' in each string is odd or even, and the loop has iterated over all the results in the list, printing each one. The loop has executed n times, where n is the number of results in the list.
