Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: index is equal to 2t+1, results is a list of strings containing 'YES' if the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd, otherwise 'NO'.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `index` is equal to 2t+1, results is a list of strings containing 'YES' if the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd, otherwise 'NO', results must have at least 1 result, result is the first result in the list, and the first result in the list which is either 'YES' or 'NO' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `index` is equal to 2t+1, results is a list of strings containing 'YES' if the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd, otherwise 'NO', results must have at least 2 results, result is the second result in the list, and the second result in the list which is either 'YES' or 'NO' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `index` is equal to 2t+1, results is a list of strings containing 'YES' if the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd, otherwise 'NO', results must have at least 3 results, result is the third result in the list, and the third result in the list which is either 'YES' or 'NO' is being printed, and the result which is either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
