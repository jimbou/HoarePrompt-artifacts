The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the third element of the data list, `index` is 5, `s` is a string equal to the fourth element of the data list, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings containing the test cases, `num_up_coins` is an integer equal to the count of 'U' in the fourth element of the data list. If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' and 'YES'. If `num_up_coins` is even, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO' and 'NO'.**
