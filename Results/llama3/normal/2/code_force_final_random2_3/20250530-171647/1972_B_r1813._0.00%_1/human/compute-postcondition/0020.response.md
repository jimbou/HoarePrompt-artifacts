The code prints the first result in the list `results`. The list `results` contains strings 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd or even, respectively. Since `result` is the first result in the list, it will be either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the count of 'U' in the first string.

Output: **YES if the count of 'U' in the first string is odd, otherwise NO**
