The code prints the third result in the list, which is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd or even.
Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (where 'YES' means the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is odd, and 'NO' means the count of 'U' in the corresponding string is even)**
