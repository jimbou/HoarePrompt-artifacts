To determine what will be printed when the given `print` statement executes, let's analyze the variables and their values based on the initial state provided:

1. `n` is a positive integer greater than `2*k - 1`.
2. `k` is a positive integer greater than 0 such that `k <= n`.
3. `v` is either `n` or 1.
4. `i` is 3.
5. `cnt` is equal to `k`.
6. `l` is 1.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```
Let's break down the components of the print statement:

- `?` is a literal character that will be printed as is.
- `{l}` will be replaced by the value of `l`, which is 1.
- `{i * v}` will be replaced by the result of the multiplication of `i` and `v`. Since `i` is 3, this expression simplifies to `3 * v`.

Given that `v` can be either `n` or 1, we have two possible outcomes for `3 * v`:

- If `v` is `n`, then `3 * v` equals `3 * n`.
- If `v` is 1, then `3 * v` equals `3 * 1`, which simplifies to 3.

However, without knowing the exact value of `n` or which value `v` takes (`n` or 1), we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `3 * v`. But we can describe the possible outcomes based on the given conditions.

Output: **? 1 3*n (if v is n) or ? 1 3 (if v is 1)**
