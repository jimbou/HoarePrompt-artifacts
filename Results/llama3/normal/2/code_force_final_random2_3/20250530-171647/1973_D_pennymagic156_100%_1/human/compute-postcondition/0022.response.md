Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that k <= n, `v` is either `n` or `1`, `i` is `1`, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `1`**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `v`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The new variables `cnt` and `l` are introduced, with `cnt` being assigned the value of `k` and `l` being assigned the value of `1`.
