The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be decreased by 1 so `i` is `n-1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is the return value of `func_2()`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0. If `v` equals `n`, then the current value of `v` equals `n` and this is printed: ? 1 [i * n].**
