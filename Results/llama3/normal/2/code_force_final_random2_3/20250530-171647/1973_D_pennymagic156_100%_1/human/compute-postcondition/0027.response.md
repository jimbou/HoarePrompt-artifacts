To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `cnt` and `l`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `cnt` is not zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is `k - 1`, which means `cnt` is not zero. However, we need to ensure that `cnt` is still greater than zero for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `cnt` must be greater than 1.

Regarding `l`, it is currently `func_2() + 2`, and we need to ensure that it is still less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute again. Since `l` is not directly related to `n`, we cannot make any assumptions about its value. However, we can say that `l` must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `n`, `k`, `v`, `i`, and the printed output, are not relevant to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= `n`, `v` is either `n` or 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is greater than 1, `l` is less than `n + 1`, and this is printed: "? 1 1" if `v` is 1, or "? 1 n" if `v` is `n`**
