Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= `n`, `v` is either `n` or 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n` + 1, and the current output is "! 1" (where 1 is the product of `i` and `v`), and the function `func_2()` has been executed.**

Note: Since the code snippet only calls a function `func_2()` without providing its definition, we cannot determine the exact changes made by this function. Therefore, the output state only indicates that the function has been executed, but the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.
