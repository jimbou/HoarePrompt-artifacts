The code prints a formatted string containing three values: a question mark '?', the value of `l` which is 1, and the product of `i` and `v`. Here, `i` is 3 and `v` is either `n` or 1.

Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and `v` is either `n` or 1, the product `i * v` will be either `3 * n` or `3 * 1`. However, the exact value of `n` is not provided, so we can't compute the exact numerical value of `3 * n`.

Output: **? 1 3 * n (where n is a positive integer greater than 1) or ? 1 3 (where v is 1)**
