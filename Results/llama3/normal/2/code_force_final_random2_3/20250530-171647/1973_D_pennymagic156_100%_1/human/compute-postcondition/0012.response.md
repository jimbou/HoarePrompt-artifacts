Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, v is n-1, i is n-1.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated to `n-1` due to the assignment `v = i`. The value of `i` remains `n-1` as it was not modified by the code. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The condition `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4` still holds true, and `n` is still greater than 0.
