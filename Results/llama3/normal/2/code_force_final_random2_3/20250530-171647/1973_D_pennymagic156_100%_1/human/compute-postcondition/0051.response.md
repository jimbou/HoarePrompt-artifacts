The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark, the value of `l` which is 1, and the product of `i` and `v`. Here, `i` is 2 and `v` is either `n` or 1. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and `v` can be either `n` or 1, the product `i * v` will be either 2 * `n` or 2 * 1.

Output: **? 1 2*n (where n is a positive integer greater than 1) or ? 1 2 (where v is 1)**
