Output State: **cnt is equal to 0, l is equal to n + 1, and the string "? l i * v" is printed k times where l ranges from 1 to n and v is either n or 1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the counter `cnt` will be equal to 0, the variable `l` will be equal to `n + 1`, and the string "? l i * v" will be printed `k` times, where `l` ranges from 1 to `n` and `v` is either `n` or 1.
