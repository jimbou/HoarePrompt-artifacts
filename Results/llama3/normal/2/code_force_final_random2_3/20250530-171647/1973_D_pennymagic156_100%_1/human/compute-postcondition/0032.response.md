The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark, the value of `l`, and the product of `i` and `v`. 

Here's a breakdown of the values:

- `l` is equal to `func_2() + 2`. Since the exact value of `func_2()` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `l`. However, based on the structure of the problem, `l` will be 2 more than the value returned by `func_2()`.
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is either `n` or 1. Since `n` is a positive integer and greater than `func_2() + 2`, and `v` is either `n` or 1, `v` will be either a positive integer greater than `func_2() + 2` or 1.

Output: **? [l] [i * v] (where l is 2 more than the value returned by func_2() and i * v is either 1 or a positive integer greater than func_2() + 2)**
