Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= `n`, `v` is either `n` or 1, `i` is 2, `cnt` is equal to `k`, `l` is 1, `n // k + 1` is greater than 2.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `v`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is now equal to `k`, and the value of `l` is now 1. The condition `n // k + 1` is greater than 2 is still valid.
