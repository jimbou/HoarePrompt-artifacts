Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

For example, if the input is n = 5 and k = 3, and the hidden array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program will not be able to find the correct answer. 

The program first tries to find the maximum value of the array by querying the maximum value of the array multiplied by its length. However, this approach is not correct because the maximum value of the array may not be the maximum value of the subarrays. 

Then, the program tries to find the correct answer by querying the maximum value of the subarrays. However, this approach is also not correct because the program does not consider all possible subarrays. 

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
