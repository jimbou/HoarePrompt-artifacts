To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `cnt` and `l` since they are the variables in the loop head.

1. For `cnt`: It needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. Since `cnt` is equal to `k` and `k` is a positive integer, we don't need to adjust `cnt` as it is already ensured to be greater than 0.

2. For `l`: It needs to be less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute again. Since `l` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer, we don't need to adjust `l` as it is already ensured to be less than `n + 1`.

However, we need to ensure that `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute again. Since `cnt` is equal to `k` and `k` is a positive integer, we can ensure that `cnt` is greater than 0. For `l`, since `l` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer, we can ensure that `l` is less than `n + 1` by ensuring that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= `n`, `v` is either `n` or 1, `i` is 3, `cnt` is equal to `k`, `l` is 1, `n // k + 1` is greater than 3, and this is printed: "? 1 3 * v" where v is either n or 1**
