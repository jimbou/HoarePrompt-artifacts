The function takes no arguments and returns no value. It performs a series of print operations based on the values of `n` and `k`, which are obtained from another function `func_3()`. The function prints a sequence of strings in the format "? l i * v" and "! i * v" where `l` ranges from 1 to `n`, `i` ranges from 1 to `n // k + 1`, and `v` is either `n` or 1. The function also calls another function `func_2()` multiple times, but its purpose is not clear from the provided code. If a certain condition is met, the function prints "! -1" and returns without any explicit value.
