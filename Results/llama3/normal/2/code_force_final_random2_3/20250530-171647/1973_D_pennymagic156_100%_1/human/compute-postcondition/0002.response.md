Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)`

Here, `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.

So, `i * n` is equivalent to `n * n`, which is the square of `n`.

The `flush=True` argument is used to force the output to be displayed immediately, but it doesn't affect the content of the output.

Therefore, the output will be a string that starts with '? 1 ' followed by the square of `n`.

Output: **? 1 [n^2] (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**
