Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n, v is either n or 1, i is 1, cnt is greater than 0, l is equal to func_2() + 2, and this is printed: "? [func_2() + 2] [v]" if v is 1, or "? [func_2() + 2] [n]" if v is n**

The code first increments the value of `l` by 1, making it equal to `func_2() + 2`. Then, it decrements the value of `cnt` by 1, making it greater than 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `v`, and `i` remain unchanged. The output statement is also updated to reflect the new value of `l`.
