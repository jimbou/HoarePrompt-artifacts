Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, v is 1**

The code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `k` using the function `func_3()`, but the specific values are not provided. However, since the precondition states that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, we can infer that the new values of `n` and `k` will still satisfy this condition. The variable `v` is assigned the value 1. No other variables are affected.
