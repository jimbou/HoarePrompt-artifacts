Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is the return value of `func_2()`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0. If `v` equals `n`, then the current value of `v` equals `n` and this is printed: ? 1 [(n-1) * n].**

The code assigns the return value of `func_2()` to `v`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition `If v equals n` is still valid, and if it is true, the specified message is printed. The output state includes all the information from the initial state that is still valid after the code has been executed, with the updated value of `v`.
