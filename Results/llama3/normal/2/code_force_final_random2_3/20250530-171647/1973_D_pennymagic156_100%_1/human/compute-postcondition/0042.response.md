The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, n and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n` and `k`. If `i` is less than `n // k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k <= n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n // k + 1` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n, v is either n or 1, i is 2, cnt is either 0 or not equal to 0, l is a positive integer such that l <= n + 1 and either cnt is not equal to 0 or l is not equal to n + 1, n // k + 1 must be greater than 2**
