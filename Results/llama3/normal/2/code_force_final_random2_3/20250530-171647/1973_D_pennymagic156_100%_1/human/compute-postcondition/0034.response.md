Output State: **n is a positive integer and greater than func_2() + 1, k is a positive integer such that k <= n, v is either n or 1, i is 1, cnt is greater than or equal to 0, l is equal to func_2() + 1, and this is printed: "? [l] [i * v]" where l is equal to func_2() + 1 and i * v is equal to either n or 1**

The code modifies the values of `l` and `cnt`. The first line decrements `cnt` by 1, making it greater than or equal to 0. The second line assigns the value of `func_2() + 1` to `l`, making it equal to `func_2() + 1`. The value of `n` is still greater than `func_2() + 1` because `func_2() + 1` is less than `func_2() + 2`. The values of `k`, `v`, and `i` remain unchanged. The printed statement is updated to reflect the new value of `l`.
