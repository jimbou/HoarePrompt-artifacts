The code prints a formatted string indicating the value of `i * n`, where `i` is `n-2` and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. The string is printed with a flush parameter set to True, which means the output buffer is immediately flushed after printing.

Output: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is the return value of `func_2()`, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 1. If `v` equals `n`, then the current value of `v` equals `n-1` and this is printed: ? 1 [(n-1) * n] and `v` is updated to `n-1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `v` and `i`. and this is printed: ? 1 [(n-2) * n]**
