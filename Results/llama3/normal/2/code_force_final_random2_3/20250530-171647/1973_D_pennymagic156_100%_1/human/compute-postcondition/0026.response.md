Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n, v is either n or 1, i is 1, cnt is k - 1, l is func_2() + 2, and this is printed: "? 1 1" if v is 1, or "? 1 n" if v is n**

The code modifies the values of `l` and `cnt`. The first line assigns the value of `func_2() + 1` to `l`, making `l` equal to `func_2() + 2`. The second line decrements `cnt` by 1, making `cnt` equal to `k - 1`. The values of `n`, `k`, `v`, and `i` remain unchanged. The print statement remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
