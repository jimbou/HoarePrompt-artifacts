Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is either `n` or `1`, `i` is `1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `n` and `k` remain positive integers within the range 1 to 10^4, `v` will either be `n` (if `func_2()` returned `n` at some point during the loop) or `1` (if `func_2()` never returned `n`), and `i` will be `1` (since the loop counts down from `n` to `1`).
