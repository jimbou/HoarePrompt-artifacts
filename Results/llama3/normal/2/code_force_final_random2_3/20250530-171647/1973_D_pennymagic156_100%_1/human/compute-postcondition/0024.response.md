The code prints a formatted string that includes a question mark, the value of `l` which is `1`, and the product of `i` and `v`. Since `i` is `1` and `v` is either `n` or `1`, the product `i * v` will be either `n` or `1`. Therefore, the output will be a string that includes the question mark, `1`, and either `n` or `1`.

Output: **? 1 [n or 1] (where n is the value of n)**
