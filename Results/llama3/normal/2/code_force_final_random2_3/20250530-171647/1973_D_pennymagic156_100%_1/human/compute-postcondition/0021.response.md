According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`. For the loop to execute, `n // k` must be at least 1, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`. Also, `i` is already 1, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that k <= n, `v` is either `n` or `1`, `i` is `1`**
