The code prints a formatted string containing three values: a question mark '?', the value of `l` which is 1, and the product of `i` and `v`. Since `i` is 2 and `v` is either `n` or 1, the product `i * v` will be either 2 times `n` or 2 times 1.

Output: **? 1 2*n (or ? 1 2, where n is the value of n)**
