Output: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than `func_2() + 2`, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= `n`, `v` is either `n` or 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is greater than 0, `l` is equal to `func_2() + 2, and this is printed: "? [l] [i * v]" where l is equal to func_2() + 2 and i * v is equal to either n or 1**
