Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the interactive problem described in the problem statement. The program uses a binary search approach to find the largest value `m` such that there exists a sequence `c_1, ..., c_{k-1}` such that `1 <= c_1 < ... < c_{k-1} < n` and `f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m`. If no such `m` exists, the program outputs `-1`.

The program correctly handles the interaction with the judge, printing the queries in the required format and reading the responses. It also correctly handles the case where the judge returns `-1` to indicate an invalid query or exceeded query limit.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
