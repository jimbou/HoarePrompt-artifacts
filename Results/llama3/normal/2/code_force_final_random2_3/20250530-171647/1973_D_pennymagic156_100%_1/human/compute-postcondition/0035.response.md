Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n, v is either n or 1, i is 1, cnt is 0, l is a positive integer such that l <= n + 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the variables have reached their final values. The value of `n` remains unchanged, `k` is still a positive integer less than or equal to `n`, `v` is still either `n` or 1, `i` is still 1, `cnt` has reached 0, and `l` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n + 1`.
