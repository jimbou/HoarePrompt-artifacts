To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `cnt` and `l` since they are the variables in the loop head.

1. `cnt` must be greater than 0, because the loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`. Since `cnt` is equal to `k` and `k` is a positive integer, `cnt` is already greater than 0.

2. `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `l` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer, `l` is already less than `n + 1`.

However, we need to ensure that `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1` for the next iteration. Since `cnt` is equal to `k` and `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= `n`, we can conclude that `cnt` will be greater than 0 for the next iteration if `k` is greater than 1. Also, since `l` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer, `l` will be less than `n + 1` for the next iteration if `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` and `n`. `k` must be greater than 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` > 1 and `k` <= `n`, `v` is either `n` or 1, `i` is 2, `cnt` is equal to `k`, `l` is 1, `n // k + 1` is greater than 2, and this is printed: "? 1 2*v" where v is either n or 1**
