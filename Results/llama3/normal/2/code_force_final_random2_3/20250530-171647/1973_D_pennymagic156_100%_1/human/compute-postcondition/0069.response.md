Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= `n`, `v` is either `n` or 1, `i` is `n` // `k` + 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n` + 1, and the string "? l i * v" is printed k times where l ranges from 1 to n and v is either n or 1, and the string "! i * v" is printed where i is n // k + 1 and v is either n or 1, and '! -1' is printed, and the function func_2() has been executed.**

The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `v`, `i`, `cnt`, and `l` remain unchanged. The function `func_2()` has been executed, but its effects on the program state are not specified, so we can only confirm that it has been executed. The output state includes the same information as the initial state, with the additional fact that `func_2()` has been executed.
