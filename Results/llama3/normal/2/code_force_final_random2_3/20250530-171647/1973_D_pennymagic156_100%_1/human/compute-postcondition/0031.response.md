According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `cnt` and `l`. If `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is greater than 0, `l` is equal to `func_2() + 2`, and `n` is a positive integer. Since `l` is equal to `func_2() + 2`, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than `func_2() + 2` to ensure that `l` is less than `n + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than `func_2() + 2`, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= `n`, `v` is either `n` or 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is greater than 0, `l` is equal to `func_2() + 2**
