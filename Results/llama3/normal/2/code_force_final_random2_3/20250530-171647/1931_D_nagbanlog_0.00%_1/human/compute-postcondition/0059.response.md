Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists with at least two cases, `results` is a list with the first element being the sum of its previous value and the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `case` is the second case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first value in `case['params']`, `x` is the second value in `case['params']`, `y` is the third value in `case['params']`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `(x - mod_x)` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq` and the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with a value of 0, and `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`.**

In this output state, the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` has been updated to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `freq` now contains the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with a value of 0, in addition to any other keys it may have had previously.
