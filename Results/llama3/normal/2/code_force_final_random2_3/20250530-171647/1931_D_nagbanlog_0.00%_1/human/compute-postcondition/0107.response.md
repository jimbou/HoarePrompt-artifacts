Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists with at least three cases, `case` is the third case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first value in `case['params']`, `x` is the second value in `case['params']`, `y` is the third value in `case['params']`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of (`x` - `mod_x`) divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) and also contains the frequency of (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) with the frequency of (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) being 1, `beautiful_count` is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` if (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq`, and `results` is a list with the first element being the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` if (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq`, and the last element being the current value of `beautiful_count`.**

In this output state, the frequency of (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) in the `freq` dictionary has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
