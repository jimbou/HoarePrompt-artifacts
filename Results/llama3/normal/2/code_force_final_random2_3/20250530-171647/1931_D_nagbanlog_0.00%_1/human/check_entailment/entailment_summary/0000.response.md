Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of "beautiful pairs" in the given array. 

The program first initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each pair of remainders modulo `x` and `y`. It then iterates over each number in the array, calculates its remainders modulo `x` and `y`, and determines the required remainders for a beautiful pair. 

If the required remainders are already in the `freq` dictionary, it increments the beautiful pairs count by the frequency of the required remainders. It then updates the frequency of the current remainders in the `freq` dictionary. 

Finally, it appends the beautiful pairs count for the current test case to the `results` list and returns the list of beautiful pairs counts for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
