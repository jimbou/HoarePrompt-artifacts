To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. Since `a` must have at least `n` elements, we can adjust the state of `a` to have at least 1 element. Additionally, we can adjust the state of `num` to be the first element in `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists with at least two cases, `results` is a list with the first element being the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` if (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq`, `case` is the second case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first value in `case['params']`, `x` is the second value in `case['params']`, `y` is the third value in `case['params']`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of (`x` - `mod_x`) divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `beautiful_count` is 0.**
