Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists with `t` cases, `case` is the last case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first value in `case['params']`, `x` is the second value in `case['params']`, `y` is the third value in `case['params']`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` that must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of (`x` - `mod_x`) divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of all pairs of remainders (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) for each element in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the sum of all frequencies of pairs (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` if (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq`, and `results` is a list with `t` elements, where each element is the sum of all frequencies of pairs (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` if (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq` for each case in `test_cases`. The number of beautiful pairs count is printed which is equal to `beautiful_count`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in `test_cases`, and for each test case, it has calculated the frequency of all pairs of remainders (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) for each element in the array `a`. The `beautiful_count` variable stores the sum of all frequencies of pairs (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` if (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq` for each test case. The `results` list stores the `beautiful_count` value for each test case. The loop has also printed the number of beautiful pairs count for each test case, which is equal to `beautiful_count`.
