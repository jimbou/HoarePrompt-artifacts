Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists with at least two cases, results is a list with the first element being the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, case is the second case in test_cases, n is the first value in case['params'], x is the second value in case['params'], y is the third value in case['params'], a is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x, required_mod_y is mod_y, freq is a dictionary that contains the key (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq and the key (mod_x, mod_y) with a value increased by 1, and beautiful_count is increased by the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq.**

The code snippet calculates the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` based on the values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` are the remainders of `num` divided by `x` and `y`, respectively. The value of `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `(x - mod_x)` divided by `x`, and the value of `required_mod_y` is the same as `mod_y`. The code does not modify any other variables, so the rest of the state remains the same.
