Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]**

Here, [num] is the first element in the list 'a' which is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, [mod_x] is the remainder of [num] divided by [x], [mod_y] is the remainder of [num] divided by [y], [required_mod_x] is the remainder of ([x] - [mod_x]) divided by [x], and [required_mod_y] is [mod_y].
