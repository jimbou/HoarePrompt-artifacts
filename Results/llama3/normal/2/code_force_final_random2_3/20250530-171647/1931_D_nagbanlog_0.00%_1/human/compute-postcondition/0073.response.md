Output: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists with at least two cases, results is a list with the first element being the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, case is the second case in test_cases, n is the first value in case['params'], x is the second value in case['params'], y is the third value in case['params'], a is the value of case['array'] that must have at least n elements, num is the nth element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x, required_mod_y is mod_y, freq is a dictionary that contains the key (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq and the key (mod_x, mod_y) with a value increased by 1, and beautiful_count is increased by the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, and this is printed: 'Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count]'**
