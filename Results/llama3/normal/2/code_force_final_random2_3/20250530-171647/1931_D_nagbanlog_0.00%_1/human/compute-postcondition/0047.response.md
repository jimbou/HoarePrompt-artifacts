Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists with at least two cases, `results` is a list with the first element being the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, `case` is the second case in test_cases, `n` is the first value in case['params'], `x` is the second value in case['params'], `y` is the third value in case['params'], `a` is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in a, `mod_x` is the remainder of num divided by x, `mod_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x, `required_mod_y` is mod_y, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the key (required_mod_x, required_mod_y), and `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq.**

In this output state, the value of `beautiful_count` has been updated by adding the frequency of the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` from the dictionary `freq`. The other variables remain unchanged.
