Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists with at least one case, `results` is an empty list, `case` is the first case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first value in `case['params']`, `x` is the second value in `case['params']`, `y` is the third value in `case['params']`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `(x - mod_x)` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary with the value of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary has been incremented by 1. The value of `beautiful_count` has also been updated to include the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq`, if it exists. All other variables remain unchanged.
