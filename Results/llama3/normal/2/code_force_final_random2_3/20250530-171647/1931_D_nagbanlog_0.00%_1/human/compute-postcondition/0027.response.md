The code prints a formatted string containing the values of num, mod_x, mod_y, required_mod_x, and required_mod_y.
The value of num is the third element in the list a, which is a part of the first case in the test_cases list.
The value of mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, where x is the second value in the params of the first case in the test_cases list.
The value of mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, where y is the third value in the params of the first case in the test_cases list.
The value of required_mod_x is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x.
The value of required_mod_y is equal to mod_y.
Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y] (where num is the third element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x, and required_mod_y is equal to mod_y)**
