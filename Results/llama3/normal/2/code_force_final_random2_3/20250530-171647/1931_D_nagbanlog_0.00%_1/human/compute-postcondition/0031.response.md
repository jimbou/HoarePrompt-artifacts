Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists with at least one case, `results` is an empty list, `case` is the first case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first value in `case['params']`, `x` is the second value in `case['params']`, `y` is the third value in `case['params']`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of (`x` - `mod_x`) divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary with the value of (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) set to 0, and `beautiful_count` is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` if (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the frequency dictionary `freq` for the key (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) is reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged.
