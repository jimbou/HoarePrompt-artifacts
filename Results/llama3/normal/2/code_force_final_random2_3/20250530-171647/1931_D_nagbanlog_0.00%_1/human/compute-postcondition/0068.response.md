Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists with at least two cases, `results` is a list with the first element being the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, `case` is the second case in test_cases, `n` is the first value in case['params'], `x` is the second value in case['params'], `y` is the third value in case['params'], `a` is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in a, `mod_x` is the remainder of num divided by x, `mod_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x, `required_mod_y` is mod_y, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the key (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq and the key (mod_x, mod_y) with a value of 0, and `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
