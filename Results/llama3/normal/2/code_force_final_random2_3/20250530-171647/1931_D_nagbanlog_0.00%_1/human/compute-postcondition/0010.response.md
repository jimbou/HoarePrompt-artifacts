Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists with at least one case, results is an empty list, case is the first case in test_cases, n is the first value in case['params'], x is the second value in case['params'], y is the third value in case['params'], a is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, num is the first element in a, freq is a dictionary that contains the key (required_mod_x, required_mod_y), beautiful_count is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x, required_mod_y is mod_y, and this is printed: "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]". The current value of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq.**

In this output state, the value of beautiful_count has been updated by adding the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in the freq dictionary to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
