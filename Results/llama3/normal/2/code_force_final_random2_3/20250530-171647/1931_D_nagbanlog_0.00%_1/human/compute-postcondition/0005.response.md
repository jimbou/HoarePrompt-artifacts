The only variable in the loop head is variable `num` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, the rest of the variables remain the same. So for the loop to be executed  the list `a` must have at least 1 element and the `num` is the first element in the list `a`.
State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists with at least one case, results is an empty list, case is the first case in test_cases, n is the first value in case['params'], x is the second value in case['params'], y is the third value in case['params'], a is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, num is the first element in a, freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0, and this is printed: "Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]"**
