Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists with at least three cases, case is the third case in test_cases, n is the first value in case['params'], x is the second value in case['params'], y is the third value in case['params'], a is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, num is the first element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x, required_mod_y is mod_y, freq is a dictionary that contains the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y), beautiful_count is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, and results is a list with the first element being the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, and the last element being the current value of beautiful_count. The current values of mod_x and mod_y are not present in freq.***
