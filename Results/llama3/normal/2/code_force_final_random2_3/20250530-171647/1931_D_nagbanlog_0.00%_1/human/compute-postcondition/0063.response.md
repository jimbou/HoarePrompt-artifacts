Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists with at least two cases, results is a list with the first element being the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, case is the second case in test_cases, n is the first value in case['params'], x is the second value in case['params'], y is the third value in case['params'], a is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x, required_mod_y is mod_y, freq is a dictionary that contains the key (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq and the key (mod_x, mod_y) with a value increased by 1 if (mod_x, mod_y) is not in freq, and beautiful_count is increased by the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq and this is printed: "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]" and beautiful_count is increased by the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq and the value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] is increased by 1.**

The code calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and assigns it to `mod_x`. It also calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and assigns it to `mod_y`. Then, it calculates the remainder of `(x - mod_x)` divided by `x` and assigns it to `required_mod_x`. Finally, it assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. The values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are updated based on the calculations. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
