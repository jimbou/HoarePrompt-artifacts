The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`.

Here's a breakdown of each variable:

*   `num`: The second element in the list `a`, which is part of the `case` dictionary in the `test_cases` list.
*   `mod_x`: The remainder of `num` divided by `x`, where `x` is the second value in the `case['params']`.
*   `mod_y`: The remainder of `num` divided by `y`, where `y` is the third value in the `case['params']`.
*   `required_mod_x`: The remainder of `(x - mod_x)` divided by `x`.
*   `required_mod_y`: The value of `mod_y`.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y] (where num is the second element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x, and required_mod_y is mod_y)**
