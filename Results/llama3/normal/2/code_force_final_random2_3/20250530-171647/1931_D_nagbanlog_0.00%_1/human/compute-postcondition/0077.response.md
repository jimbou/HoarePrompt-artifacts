The code prints a formatted string indicating that it is processing a test case with specific values for n, x, y, and array a. The values of n, x, and y are the first, second, and third values in the 'params' of the third case in test_cases, respectively. The value of a is the 'array' of the third case in test_cases.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where n is the first value in case['params'], x is the second value in case['params'], y is the third value in case['params'], and a is the value of case['array'])**
