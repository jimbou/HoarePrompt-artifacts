Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program iterates over each test case and extracts the parameters n, x, and y, as well as the array a.

2. It initializes a dictionary freq to store the frequency of each pair of remainders (mod_x, mod_y) for each element in a.

3. It iterates over each element num in a, calculates the remainders mod_x and mod_y, and the required remainders required_mod_x and required_mod_y.

4. If the required pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is already in the freq dictionary, it increments the beautiful_count by the frequency of this pair.

5. It then updates the frequency of the current pair (mod_x, mod_y) in the freq dictionary.

6. After processing all elements in a, it appends the beautiful_count to the results list.

7. Finally, it returns the results list, which contains the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
