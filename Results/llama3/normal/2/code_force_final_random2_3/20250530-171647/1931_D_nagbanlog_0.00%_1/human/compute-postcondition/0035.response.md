The code prints a formatted string indicating the count of beautiful pairs. The beautiful pairs count is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq. Where required_mod_x is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x, required_mod_y is mod_y, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, num is the nth element in a, n is the first value in case['params'], x is the second value in case['params'], y is the third value in case['params'], a is the value of case['array'] that must have at least n elements, and case is the first case in test_cases.
Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq)**
