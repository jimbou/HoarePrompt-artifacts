Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists with at least two cases, `results` is a list with the first element being the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, `case` is the second case in test_cases, `n` is the first value in case['params'], `x` is the second value in case['params'], `y` is the third value in case['params'], `a` is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in a, `mod_x` is the remainder of num divided by x, `mod_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x, `required_mod_y` is mod_y, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the key (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq and the key (mod_x, mod_y) with a value increased by 1 if (mod_x, mod_y) is not in freq, and `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, and this is printed: "Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]" and the value of freq[mod_x, mod_y] is increased by 1, and `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq. All other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
