    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists with `t` cases, `case` is the last case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first value in `case['params']`, `x` is the second value in `case['params']`, `y` is the third value in `case['params']`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` that must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of (`x` - `mod_x`) divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of all pairs of remainders (`mod_x`, `mod_y`) for each element in `a`, `beautiful_count` is the sum of all frequencies of pairs (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` if (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq`, and `results` is a list with `t` elements, where each element is the sum of all frequencies of pairs (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) in `freq` if (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq` for each case in `test_cases`.

    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the sum of all frequencies of pairs (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq for each case in test_cases. Each integer in the list corresponds to the number of beautiful pairs count for each case, which is equal to beautiful_count. The list has t elements, where t is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of "beautiful pairs" in a list of test cases. A beautiful pair is defined as two numbers that have the same remainder when divided by y and have remainders that add up to x when divided by x. The function takes a list of test cases, where each test case contains a list of parameters (n, x, y) and a list of numbers. It calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each test case and returns a list of these counts. The function also prints the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
