Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists with at least one case, `results` is an empty list, `case` is the first case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first value in `case['params']`, `x` is the second value in `case['params']`, `y` is the third value in `case['params']`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `(x - mod_x)` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is `(mod_x, mod_y)` and the value is 0, and the current value of `(mod_x, mod_y)` is in `freq`.**

In this output state, the dictionary `freq` has been updated with a new key-value pair where the key is the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` and the value is 0. This means that the frequency of the pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` is now being tracked in the `freq` dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged.
