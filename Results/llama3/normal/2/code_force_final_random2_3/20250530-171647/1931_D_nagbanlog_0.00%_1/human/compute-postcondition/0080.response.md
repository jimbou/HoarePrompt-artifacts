Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists with at least three cases, case is the third case in test_cases, n is the first value in case['params'], x is the second value in case['params'], y is the third value in case['params'], a is the value of case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, num is the first element in a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of (x - mod_x) divided by x, required_mod_y is mod_y, freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0, results is a list with the first element being the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, and the last element being the current value of beautiful_count, and this is printed: 'Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]'**

The code snippet provided does not modify any variables in the initial state. It only reassigns the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` based on the existing values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
