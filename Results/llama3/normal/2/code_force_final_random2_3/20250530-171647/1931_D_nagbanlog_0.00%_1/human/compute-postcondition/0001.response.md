To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `case` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` has at least one case. Since `t` is a positive integer and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, we can infer that `test_cases` has at least one case. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `case` to be the first case in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists with at least one case, `results` is an empty list, `case` is the first case in `test_cases`**
