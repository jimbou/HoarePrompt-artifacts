Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists with at least one case, results is an empty list, case is the first case in test_cases, n is the first value in case['params'], x is the second value in case['params'], y is the third value in case['params'], a is the value of case['array'], freq is an empty dictionary, beautiful_count is 0**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, and `case` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code snippet extracts values from the `case` dictionary and assigns them to new variables: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`. The `freq` dictionary is initialized as an empty dictionary, and the `beautiful_count` variable is set to 0.
