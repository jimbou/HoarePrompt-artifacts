The code appends a new element to the list `a`, which is the difference between the last element of `a` (i.e., 1000) and the first element of `T` (i.e., `T[i - 1]`).

Since `i` is 1, `T[i - 1]` is the first element of `T`. The value of `T[i - 1]` is not specified, but we know that `T` is a list of `t-1` integers, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive.

Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `1000 - T[0]`, where `T[0]` is the first element of `T`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `T` is a list of `t-1` integers, `a` is a list containing two elements: 1000 and 1000 - T[0], `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case**
