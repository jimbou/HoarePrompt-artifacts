The value of `a[i - 1]` is `1000 - T[0]` and the value of `T[i - 1]` is `T[1]`. So, `a` is assigned the value `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`, which is `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1]`. The value of `result` is not affected. The values of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is at least 2, `T` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing three elements: 1000, 1000 - T[0], and (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], `result` is a string of space-separated integers representing the list [1000, 1000 - T[0]], `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.**
