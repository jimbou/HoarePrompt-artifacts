Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer from stdin, `T` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing `n` elements: 1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]) - T[n-1], `result` is a string of space-separated integers representing the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n+1` test cases, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is: the variable `t` has been decreased by 1, the list `a` now contains `n` elements, where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in list `T` from the previous element in `a`, the variable `result` still represents the list `a` as a string of space-separated integers, and the variable `i` has reached `n-1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
