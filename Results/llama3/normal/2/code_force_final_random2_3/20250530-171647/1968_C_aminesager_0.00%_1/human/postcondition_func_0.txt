The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n-1 integers. It then calculates a list of n integers by subtracting the input integers from 1000 in reverse order, and prints the resulting list in reverse order as a string of space-separated integers. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.
