To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, which is at least 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is at least 2, `T` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing two elements: 1000 and 1000 - T[0], `result` is a string of space-separated integers representing the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `i` is 2**
