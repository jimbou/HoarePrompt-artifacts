Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the `n-1` integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.
3. It initializes the list `a` with a single element `1000`, which will be used as the first element of the output array.
4. It then iterates over the input integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` in reverse order, subtracting each integer from the previous element in the list `a`. This is done to satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`.
5. After the iteration, the list `a` is reversed to obtain the correct order of the output array.
6. Finally, the program prints the resulting list `a` as a string of space-separated integers.

The program's logic is correct, and it satisfies the conditions specified in the problem description. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
