To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is simply `while t:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero.

Given that `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, we can see that `t` is already guaranteed to be non-zero. Therefore, no adjustments to the state of `t` are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

The state of `stdin` (containing multiple test cases) does not affect the loop condition directly, so we do not need to adjust it.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of one line containing `t-1` integers**
