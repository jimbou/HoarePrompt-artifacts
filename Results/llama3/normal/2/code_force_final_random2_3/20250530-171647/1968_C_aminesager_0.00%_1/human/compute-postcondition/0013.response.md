The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, n is an integer, T is a list of t-1 integers, a is a list containing n elements: (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]) - T[n-1], (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]), ..., (1000 - T[0]), 1000, result is a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, and the result which is a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list a is being printed and t must be greater than 0**
