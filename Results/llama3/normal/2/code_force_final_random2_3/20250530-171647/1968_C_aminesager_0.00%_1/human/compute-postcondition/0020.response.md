Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 inclusive, `n` is at least 4, `T` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list containing four elements: 1000, `1000 - T[0]`, `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1]`, and `((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2]`, `result` is a string "1000", `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the result of subtracting `T[2]` from the third element of `a`, i.e., `((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
