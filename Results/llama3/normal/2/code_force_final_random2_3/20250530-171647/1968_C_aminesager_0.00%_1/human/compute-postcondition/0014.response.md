Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 498 inclusive, n is an integer, T is a list of n integers, a is a list containing one element: 1000, result is a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and its range has been updated accordingly. The value of `n` has been updated to an integer read from the input. The list `T` now contains `n` integers read from the input. The list `a` has been reinitialized to contain only one element, which is 1000. The `result` variable still holds the string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list `a`, but since `a` has been reinitialized, the `result` is now a string representing the reversed list containing only one element, 1000. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, as two inputs have been read.
