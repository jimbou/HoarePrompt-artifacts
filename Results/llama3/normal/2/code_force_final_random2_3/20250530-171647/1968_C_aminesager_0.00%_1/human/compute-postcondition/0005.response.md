To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

The other variables, `t`, `T`, and `a`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

The state of `stdin` is not directly related to the loop head, but since the loop is executing multiple test cases, we can assume that there is still at least one test case left in `stdin`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 2, `T` is a list of `t-1` integers, `a` is a list containing two elements: 1000 and 1000 - T[0], `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case**
