Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, n is an integer, T is a list of t-1 integers, a is a list containing the single element 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now between 1 and 499 inclusive. The variable `n` has been assigned an integer value from the input. The variable `T` has been assigned a list of `t-1` integers from the input. The variable `a` has been assigned a list containing the single element 1000. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
