Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `T` is a list of `t-1` integers, `a` is a list containing `n` elements: 1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]) - T[n-1], `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still an integer, `T` is still a list of `t-1` integers, and `a` is now a list containing `n` elements, where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element from `T` from the previous element in `a`. The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus one test case.
