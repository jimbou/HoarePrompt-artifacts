The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is at least 3, `T` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing three elements: 1000, 1000 - T[0], and (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], `result` is a string of space-separated integers representing the list [1000, 1000 - T[0]], `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.**
