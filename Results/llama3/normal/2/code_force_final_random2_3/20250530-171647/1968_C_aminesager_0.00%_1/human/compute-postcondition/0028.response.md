Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is at least 2, `T` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing two elements: 1000 and 1000 - T[0], `result` is a string of space-separated integers representing the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the difference between the first element of `a` (1000) and the first element of `T` (T[0]). The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less test case.
