Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer, T is a list of n integers, a is a list containing n elements: (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]) - T[n-1], (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]), ..., 1000 - T[0], 1000, result is a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list a, stdin contains no test cases, and the result which is a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list a is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` becomes 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `n` remains an integer, and `T` is a list of `n` integers. The list `a` contains `n` elements, where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from 1000, and the list is reversed. The `result` variable is a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list `a`. The standard input `stdin` contains no more test cases, and the result is being printed.
