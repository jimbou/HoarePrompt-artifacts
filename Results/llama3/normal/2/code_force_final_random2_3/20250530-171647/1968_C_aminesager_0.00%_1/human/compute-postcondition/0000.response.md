The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains a single integer `n` (2 <= n <= 500), this integer is assigned to `t`. Therefore, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive. The second line of the test case, which contains `n-1` integers, is still in the stdin. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case consists of one line containing `t-1` integers.**
