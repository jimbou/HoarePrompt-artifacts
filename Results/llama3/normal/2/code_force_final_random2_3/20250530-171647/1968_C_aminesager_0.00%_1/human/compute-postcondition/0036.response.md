Output: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, T is a list of n integers, a is a list containing n elements: (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]) - T[n-1], (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]), ..., 1000 - T[0], 1000, result is a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n+1 test cases, i is n-1, and the result which is a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list a is being printed**
