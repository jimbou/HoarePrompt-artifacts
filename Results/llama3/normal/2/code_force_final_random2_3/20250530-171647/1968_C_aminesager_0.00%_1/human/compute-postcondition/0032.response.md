Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is at least 3, `T` is a list of `n` integers from stdin, `a` is a list containing four elements: 1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], and ((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2], `result` is a string of space-separated integers representing the list [1000, 1000 - T[0]], `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the difference between the third element of `a` (i.e., `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1]`) and the third element of `T` (i.e., `T[2]`). The other variables remain unchanged.
