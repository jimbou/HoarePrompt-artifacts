Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, n is an integer, T is a list of t-1 integers, a is a list containing n elements: (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]) - T[n-1], (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]), ..., (1000 - T[0]), 1000, result is a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The code snippet reverses the list `a` and then converts it into a string of space-separated integers. The list `a` originally contains `n` elements, which are calculated based on the list `T`. After reversing, the order of these elements is changed, but their values remain the same. The variable `result` is assigned the string representation of the reversed list `a`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `T` are not modified by the code.
