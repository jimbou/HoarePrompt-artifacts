The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 498 inclusive, which does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to t is greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer, T is a list of n integers, a is a list containing n elements: ((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - ... - T[n-2], ((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - ... - T[n-3], ..., (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000, result is a string of space-separated integers representing the list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is n-1, and this is printed: a string of space-separated integers representing the list a**
