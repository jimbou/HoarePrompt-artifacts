To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is at least 2, it must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `t`, `T`, `a`, `result`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 inclusive, `n` is at least 3, `T` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list containing two elements: 1000 and `1000 - T[0]`, `result` is a string "1000", `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is 2**
