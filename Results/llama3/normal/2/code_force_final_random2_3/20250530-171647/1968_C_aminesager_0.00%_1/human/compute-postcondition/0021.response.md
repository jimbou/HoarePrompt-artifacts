Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498 inclusive, `n` is an integer, `T` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list containing `n` elements: 1000, `1000 - T[0]`, `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1]`, ..., `((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - ... - T[n-2]`, `result` is a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` will contain `n` elements, where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element from the list `T` from the previous element in `a`. The `result` variable will still hold the reversed list `a` as a string of space-separated integers. The other variables, `t`, `n`, `T`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged. The loop counter `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
