The code prints a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list `a`. The list `a` contains `n` elements, each calculated as the difference between 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `T` from the last element to the first. The first element of `a` is `(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]) - T[n-1]`, the second element is `(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2])`, and so on, until the last element, which is `1000`. The list `a` is then reversed and printed as a string of space-separated integers.

Output: **a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list a, where each integer is the difference between 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in the list T from the last element to the first, in reverse order**
