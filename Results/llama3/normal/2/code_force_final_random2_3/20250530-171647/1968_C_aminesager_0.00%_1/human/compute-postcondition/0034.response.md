Output State: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer, T is a list of n integers, a is a list containing n elements: (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]) - T[n-1], (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]), ..., 1000 - T[0], 1000, result is a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n+1 test cases, i is n-1.**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains greater than 0 but has been decreased by 1. The value of `n` remains an integer. The list `T` still contains `n` integers. The list `a` has been reversed, now containing the elements in the reverse order: the last element of the original list `a` is now the first element, and the first element of the original list `a` is now the last element. The string `result` now represents the reversed list `a` as a string of space-separated integers. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing multiple test cases minus `n+1` test cases. The value of `i` remains `n-1`.
