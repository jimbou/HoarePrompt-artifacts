The code appends a new element to the list `a`, which is the difference between the last element of `a` and the element at index `i-1` of list `T`. The value of `i` is 2.

The last element of `a` is `1000 - T[0]`, and the element at index `i-1` of list `T` is `T[1]`.

So, the new element appended to `a` is `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1]`.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 2, `T` is a list of `t-1` integers, `a` is a list containing three elements: 1000, 1000 - T[0], and (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case**
