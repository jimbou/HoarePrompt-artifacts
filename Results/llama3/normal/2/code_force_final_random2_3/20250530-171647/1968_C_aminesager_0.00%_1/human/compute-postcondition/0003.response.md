To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `T` is a list of `t-1` integers, `a` is a list containing the single element 1000, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case**
