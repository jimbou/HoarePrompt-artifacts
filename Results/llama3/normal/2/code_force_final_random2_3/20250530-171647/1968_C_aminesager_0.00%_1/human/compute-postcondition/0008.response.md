Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 3, `T` is a list of `t-1` integers, `a` is a list containing four elements: 1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], and ((1000 - T[0]) - T[1]) - T[2], `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case**

In this output state, the list `a` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the difference between the third last element of `a` and the third element of `T`. The values of `t`, `n`, `T`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
