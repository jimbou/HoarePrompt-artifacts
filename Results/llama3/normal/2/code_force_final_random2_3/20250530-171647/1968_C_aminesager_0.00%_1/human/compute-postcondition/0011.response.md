The code prints a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list `a`. The list `a` is constructed by subtracting the cumulative sum of elements in list `T` from 1000, starting from the last element of `T` and moving backwards to the first element. The resulting list is then reversed and printed as a string of space-separated integers.

Output: **a string of space-separated integers representing the reversed list a, where a is constructed by subtracting the cumulative sum of elements in list T from 1000**
