The value of `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]` which is `1000 - T[0]`. The value of `T[i - 1]` is `T[1]`. The value of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]` is `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1]`. This value is appended to `a`. The value of `a` is now `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1]]`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 0 and 498 inclusive, `n` is at least 3, `T` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list containing three elements: 1000, `1000 - T[0]`, and `(1000 - T[0]) - T[1]`, `result` is a string "1000", `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is 2.
