Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is:

    2
    500

The program outputs:

    501 500

However, this output does not satisfy the condition that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n. Specifically, 500 mod 501 ≠ 500.

The issue with the program is that it assumes that a_i can be calculated as a_{i-1} - x_i, which is not always true. A correct solution would need to consider all possible values of a_i that satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}.
