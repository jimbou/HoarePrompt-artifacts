Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where the value at each index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A' is incremented by the number of occurrences of that character in `a`, `char` is the last character in the string `a`, `needed_problems` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `count[i]` is less than `m`.**
