Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where the value at each index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A' is incremented by the number of occurrences of that character in `a`, `char` is the last character in the string `a`, `needed_problems` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(7):
    if count[i] < m:
        needed_problems += m - count[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where the value at each index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A' is incremented by the number of occurrences of that character in `a`, `char` is the last character in the string `a`, `i` is 0. If the count of the first character in `a` is less than `m`, then `needed_problems` is set to `m - count[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where the value at each index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A' is incremented by the number of occurrences of that character in `a`, `char` is the last character in the string `a`, `i` is 1. If the count of the first character in `a` is less than `m` and the count of the second character in `a` is also less than `m`, then `needed_problems` is set to `m - count[0] + m - count[1]`. Otherwise, `needed_problems` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where the value at each index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A' is incremented by the number of occurrences of that character in `a`, `char` is the last character in the string `a`, `i` is 2. If the count of the character at index 2 is less than `m`, `needed_problems` is increased by `m - count[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
