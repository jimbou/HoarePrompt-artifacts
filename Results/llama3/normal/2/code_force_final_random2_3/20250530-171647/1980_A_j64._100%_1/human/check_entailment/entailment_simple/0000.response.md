Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with to hold m rounds. It first counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the bank of problems, then calculates the number of problems needed for each difficulty level by subtracting the count from m. The sum of these differences gives the total number of problems needed.

Correctness: **True**
