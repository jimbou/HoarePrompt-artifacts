Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 2 characters, `count` is a list of 7 integers where the value at the index corresponding to the ASCII value of the second character of `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A' is incremented by 2, char is the second character in the string `a`.**

The value of `count` at the index corresponding to the ASCII value of the second character of `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A' is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected.
