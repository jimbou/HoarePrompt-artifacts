Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 1 character, `count` is a list of 7 integers where the value at the index corresponding to the ASCII value of the first character of `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A' is incremented by 1, char is the first character in the string `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been updated to reflect the occurrence of the first character in the string `a`. The index of the incremented value in the `count` list corresponds to the ASCII value of the first character of `a` minus the ASCII value of 'A'. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `char` remain unchanged.
