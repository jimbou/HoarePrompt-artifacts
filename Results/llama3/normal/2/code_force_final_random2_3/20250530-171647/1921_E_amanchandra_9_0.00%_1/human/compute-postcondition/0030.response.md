The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the number of test cases in the input. If `i` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and there is at least 1 test case in the input. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and there must be at least 2 test cases in the input.

State: **`i` is 2, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers, stdin contains at least 2 test cases, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are assigned the next 6 integers from the input**
