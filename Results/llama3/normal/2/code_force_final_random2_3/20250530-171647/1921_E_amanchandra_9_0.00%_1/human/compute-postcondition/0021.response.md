Output State: **`i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers, `x` is the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are assigned the first 6 integers from the input**

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated as the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2. The values of `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least 1 test case.
