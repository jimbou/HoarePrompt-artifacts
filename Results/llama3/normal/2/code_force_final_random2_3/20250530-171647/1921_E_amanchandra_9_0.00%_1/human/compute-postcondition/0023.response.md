To determine what will be printed when the given statement executes, let's break down the precondition and the code step by step.

1. **Precondition**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers.
   - `x` is the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
   - `stdin` contains at least 1 test case with 6 fewer integers.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on a condition.
   - The condition checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x + 1` and if the absolute difference between `r` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.

Given the complexity of directly computing the values without specific numbers for `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`, we can still describe the output based on the conditions provided.

- If the condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` is true, it means that `ya` is within a certain range defined by `l`, `r`, and `x`. In this case, the code prints 'Alice'.
- If the condition is false, the code prints 'Draw'.

Since we don't have explicit values for `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`, we cannot compute the exact values of `l`, `r`, and `x` to determine the outcome of the condition. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'Alice' or 'Draw' depending on the condition.

Output: **'Alice' if the condition is true, 'Draw' otherwise**
