To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions within the print statement.

Initial State:

- `i` is 2.
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers assigned the next 6 integers from the input.
- `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2.
- `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`.
- `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
- `stdin` contains at least 1 test case.

The print statement is:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
```

This statement prints either `'Draw'` or `'Alice'` based on the condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`.

- If the condition is `True`, it prints `'Alice'`.
- If the condition is `False`, it prints `'Draw'`.

The condition checks two things:
1. If the absolute difference between `l` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
2. If the absolute difference between `r` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.

Since the exact values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are not provided, we cannot calculate the exact values of `x`, `l`, and `r`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `'Alice'` or `'Draw'` depending on whether the condition is met.

Output: **'Alice' if the condition is true, 'Draw' if the condition is false**
