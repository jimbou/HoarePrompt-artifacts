Output State: **`i` is 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case - 1**.

In this output state, the values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers because they are assigned the values from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The value of `i` remains 0 as it is not affected by the code. The stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1 because one test case has been read and processed by the code.
