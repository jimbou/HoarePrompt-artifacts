Output State: **`i` is 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case - 1, `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is equal to the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains 0, and the values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are still integers. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case - 1. The relationship between `xa` and `xb` remains the same, with `xa` being less than or equal to `xb`. A new variable `x` is introduced, which is calculated as the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2.
