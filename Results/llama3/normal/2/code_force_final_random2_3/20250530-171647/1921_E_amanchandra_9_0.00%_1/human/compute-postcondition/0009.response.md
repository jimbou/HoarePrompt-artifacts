The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`. Here, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`, `x` is the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2, and `ya` is an integer.

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `x`, and `ya` are not provided, we can't determine the exact output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'Draw' or 'Alice' depending on the conditions.

Output: **'Draw' if the conditions are not met, 'Alice' if the conditions are met**
