Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers, `x` is the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case with 6 fewer integers. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x` + 1 and the absolute difference between `r` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x` + 1. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - yb)` <= `x` and `abs(r - yb)` <= `x`.***
