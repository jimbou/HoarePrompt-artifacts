Output State: **The loop has executed for all test cases in the input, and the output for each test case has been printed. The values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are the last 6 integers from the input. If `xa` is greater than `xb`, 'Draw' is printed. If `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`, where `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`, where `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `ya + x`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input and printed the corresponding outputs. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are the last set of values read from the input. The output for the last test case is determined based on the conditions specified in the loop body, which depend on the values of `xa`, `xb`, `x`, `l`, `r`, `ya`, and `yb`.
