Output: **i is 1, h, w, xa, ya, xb, and yb are integers, x is the integer division of the absolute difference between xa and xb by 2, l is the maximum of 1 and ya - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, stdin contains at least 1 test case with 6 integers removed, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed based on the conditions abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x. If both conditions are true, 'Draw' is printed; otherwise, 'Bob' is printed.**
