Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips on the board. The program first checks if Alice's x-coordinate is greater than Bob's, in which case it prints 'Draw'. If Alice's x-coordinate is less than or equal to Bob's, it calculates the difference between their x-coordinates and checks if it is odd or even. If the difference is odd, it checks if Alice can reach Bob's y-coordinate within a certain distance, and if so, prints 'Alice'. If the difference is even, it checks if Bob can reach Alice's y-coordinate within a certain distance, and if so, prints 'Bob'. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'. The program processes multiple test cases from standard input and prints the result for each case.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly handles all possible cases. It also correctly calculates the distances and checks the conditions for Alice and Bob to win. The use of the `//` operator for integer division and the `abs` function for calculating absolute differences is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
