The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`. The values of `l`, `r`, `x`, and `ya` are determined by the input values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. The output is either 'Draw' or 'Alice', depending on whether the absolute differences between `l` and `ya` and between `r` and `ya` are less than or equal to `x + 1`.

Output: **i is 2, h, w, xa, ya, xb, and yb are integers assigned the next 6 integers from the input, x is the absolute difference between xa and xb divided by 2, l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, stdin contains at least 1 test case, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`**
