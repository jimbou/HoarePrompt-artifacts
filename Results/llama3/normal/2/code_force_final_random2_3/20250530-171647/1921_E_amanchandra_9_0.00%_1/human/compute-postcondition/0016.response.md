Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case - 1. If `xa` is greater than `xb`, 'Draw' is printed. If `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is equal to the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is equal to the maximum of 1 and `yb` - `x`, `r` is equal to the minimum of `w` and `yb` + `x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x` + 1 and the absolute difference between `r` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x` + 1. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `l` is equal to the maximum of 1 and `ya` - `x`, `r` is equal to the minimum of `w` and `yb` + `x`, and 'Draw' is printed if the absolute difference between `l` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x` and the absolute difference between `r` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.***
