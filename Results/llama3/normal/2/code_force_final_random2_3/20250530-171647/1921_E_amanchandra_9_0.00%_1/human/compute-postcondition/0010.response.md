Output: **i is 0, h, w, xa, ya, xb, and yb are integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case - 1, xa is less than or equal to xb, x is equal to the integer division of the absolute difference between xa and xb by 2, l is equal to the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is equal to the minimum of w and yb + x, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between l and ya is less than or equal to x + 1 and the absolute difference between r and ya is less than or equal to x + 1**
