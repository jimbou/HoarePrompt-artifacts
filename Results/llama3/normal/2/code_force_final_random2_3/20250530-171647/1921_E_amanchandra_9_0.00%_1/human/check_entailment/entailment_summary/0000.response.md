Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game based on the initial positions of Alice and Bob on the board. The program takes into account the rules of the game, including the possible moves for each player and the conditions for winning or drawing.

The program first checks if Alice's x-coordinate is greater than Bob's, in which case the game is a draw. If not, it calculates the difference between their x-coordinates and the distance between their y-coordinates. Based on these values, it determines whether Alice or Bob can reach the other player's y-coordinate within a certain distance, and prints the corresponding result.

The program also correctly handles the cases where the difference between the x-coordinates is odd or even, and where the players are in the same column or not. It also correctly prints 'Draw' when neither player can secure a victory.

Correctness: **True**
