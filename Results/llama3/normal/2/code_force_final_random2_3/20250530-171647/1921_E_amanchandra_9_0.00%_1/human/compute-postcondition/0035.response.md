Output State: **i is 2, h, w, xa, ya, xb, and yb are integers assigned the next 6 integers from the input, x is the absolute difference between xa and xb divided by 2, l is the maximum of 1 and yb - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, stdin contains at least 1 test case**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The value of `x` is still the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, as it was not affected by the code. The code introduced two new variables, `l` and `r`, which are assigned the maximum of 1 and `yb - x` and the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`, respectively. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing at least 1 test case.
