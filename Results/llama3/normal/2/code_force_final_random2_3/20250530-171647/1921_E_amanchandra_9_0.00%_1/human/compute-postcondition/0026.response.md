To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given expression and the initial state:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers.
   - `x` is the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
   - `stdin` contains at least 1 test case with 6 integers removed.

2. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   - `print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])`

This expression uses a conditional statement within a list index. The list `['Draw'], ['Bob']` is indexed by a boolean value that results from the condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x`. 

- If the condition is `True`, it will print the first element of the list, which is `'Draw'`.
- If the condition is `False`, it will print the second element of the list, which is `'Bob'`.

However, since `i` is given but not used in the expression, and the exact values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `x`, `l`, and `r`, nor can we directly evaluate the condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x`.

Given the structure of the problem and the information provided, the output will depend on whether the absolute differences between `l` and `yb`, and `r` and `yb`, are less than or equal to `x`. Since we cannot calculate these values precisely without more information, we describe the output based on the condition.

**Output: ** **'Draw' if the absolute differences between `l` and `yb`, and `r` and `yb`, are less than or equal to `x`; otherwise, 'Bob'**.
