Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b (1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6, 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9) â€” the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
    if xa > xb:
        print('Draw')
    else:
        x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
        if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
            l = max(1, yb - x)
            r = min(w, yb + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r -
                ya) <= x + 1])
        else:
            l = max(1, ya - x)
            r = min(w, yb + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case - 1. If `xa` is greater than `xb`, 'Draw' is printed. If `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is equal to the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is equal to the maximum of 1 and `yb` - `x`, `r` is equal to the minimum of `w` and `yb` + `x`, and either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x` + 1 and the absolute difference between `r` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x` + 1. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `l` is equal to the maximum of 1 and `ya` - `x`, `r` is equal to the minimum of `w` and `yb` + `x`, and 'Draw' is printed if the absolute difference between `l` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x` and the absolute difference between `r` and `yb` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are assigned the first 6 integers from the input. If `xa` is greater than `xb`, the string 'Draw' is printed. Otherwise, `x` is the integer division of the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` by 2. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the absolute difference between `l` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x` + 1 and the absolute difference between `r` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x` + 1. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - yb)` <= `x` and `abs(r - yb)` <= `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers assigned the next 6 integers from the input, stdin contains at least 1 test case. If `xa` is greater than `xb`, 'Draw' is printed. If `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`, `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`, where `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`, where `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `ya + x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
