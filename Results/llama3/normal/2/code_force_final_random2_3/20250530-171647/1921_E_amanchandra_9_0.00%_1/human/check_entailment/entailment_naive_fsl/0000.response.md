Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column, but Alice is not in the last row and Bob is not in the first row. In this case, the program will print "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can win by moving down to Bob's position.

For example, if the input is:

10 10 5 5 9 5

The program will print "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice".
