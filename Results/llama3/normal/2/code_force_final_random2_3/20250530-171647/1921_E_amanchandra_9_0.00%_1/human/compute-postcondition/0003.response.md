Based on the precondition, the code will print the string 'Draw'.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The precondition states that `i` is 0, which means the code is in its initial state.
* The precondition also states that `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers, but their specific values are not provided.
* The precondition also states that the current value of `xa` is greater than the current value of `xb`, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* The print statement simply prints the string 'Draw', without referencing any variables or objects.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'Draw', without any additional information or values.

Output: **Draw**
