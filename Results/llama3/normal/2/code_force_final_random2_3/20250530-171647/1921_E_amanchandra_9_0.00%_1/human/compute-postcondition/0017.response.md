The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the number of test cases in stdin. If `i` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and stdin must contain at least 2 test cases.
State: **`i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers, stdin contains at least 2 test cases**
