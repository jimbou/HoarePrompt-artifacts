Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board by Alice and Bob. The game's rules and constraints are as follows:

- The board has h rows and w columns.
- Alice's chip is initially located at (x_a, y_a), and Bob's chip is initially located at (x_b, y_b).
- Alice can move her chip one cell down, down-right, or down-left (diagonally).
- Bob can move his chip one cell up, up-right, or up-left.
- A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the other player's chip.
- If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in the last row, i.e., x_a = h, Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e., x_b = 1), the game immediately ends in a draw.

The program works by iterating over each test case and determining the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  If `xa > xb`, the program prints 'Draw' because Alice is already in a winning position, and Bob cannot move his chip to a position that would allow him to win.
2.  If `xa <= xb`, the program calculates the number of moves `x` that Alice needs to make to reach Bob's row.
3.  If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is 1 (i.e., the number of moves is odd), the program calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` that Bob can reach in `x + 1` moves.
4.  If `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`, the program prints 'Alice' because Alice can win by moving her chip to a position that Bob cannot reach. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.
5.  If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is 0 (i.e., the number of moves is even), the program calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` that Alice can reach in `x` moves.
6.  If `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`, the program prints 'Bob' because Bob can win by moving his chip to a position that Alice cannot reach. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately determines the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

Correctness: **True**
