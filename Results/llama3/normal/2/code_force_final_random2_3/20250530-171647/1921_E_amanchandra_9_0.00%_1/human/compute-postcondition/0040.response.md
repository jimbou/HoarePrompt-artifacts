The code prints either 'Draw' or 'Bob' based on the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`. The values of `l`, `r`, `x`, and `yb` are used to determine which string is printed.

Output: **i is 2, h is an integer, w is an integer, xa is an integer, ya is an integer, xb is an integer, yb is an integer, x is the absolute difference between xa and xb divided by 2, l is the maximum of 1 and ya - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, stdin contains at least 1 test case, and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is printed based on the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`.**
