Output State: **i is 1, h, w, xa, ya, xb, and yb are integers, x is the integer division of the absolute difference between xa and xb by 2, l is the maximum of 1 and ya - x, r is the minimum of w and yb + x, stdin contains at least 1 test case with 6 integers removed.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code introduces two new variables, `l` and `r`, which are assigned values based on the existing variables. The value of `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, while the value of `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. The state of `stdin` is also updated, as the first 6 integers have been removed, leaving at least 1 test case.
