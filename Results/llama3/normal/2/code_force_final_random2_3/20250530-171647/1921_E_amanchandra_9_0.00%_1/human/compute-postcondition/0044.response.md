Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on their initial positions on a board. It takes six integers as input: the dimensions of the board (h and w) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (xa, ya, xb, and yb). The function then prints 'Draw' if Alice's x-coordinate is greater than Bob's, or determines the winner based on the difference between their x-coordinates and the distance between their y-coordinates. If the difference between their x-coordinates is odd, the function checks if Alice can reach Bob's y-coordinate within a certain distance, and if so, prints 'Alice'. If the difference is even, the function checks if Bob can reach Alice's y-coordinate within a certain distance, and if so, prints 'Bob'. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'. The function processes multiple test cases from standard input and prints the result for each case.**
