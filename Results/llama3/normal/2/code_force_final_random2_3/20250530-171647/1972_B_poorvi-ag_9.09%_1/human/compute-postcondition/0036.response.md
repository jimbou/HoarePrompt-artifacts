Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is equal to 0, `i` is the last element in the list, `n` is an integer equal to the integer value of the last input, `arr` is a string equal to the second last input, `stdin` contains no test cases, `results` is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, and the last element of the list which is `i` has been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged at 0, `i` has taken the value of the last element in the `results` list, `n` and `arr` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop, `stdin` still contains no test cases, and the `results` list has been fully iterated over with its last element being printed.
