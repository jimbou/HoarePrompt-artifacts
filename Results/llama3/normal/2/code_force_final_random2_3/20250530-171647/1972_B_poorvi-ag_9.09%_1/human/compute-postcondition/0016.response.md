Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 and must be greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If n is even, results is a list containing the string 'no'. If n is odd, results is a list containing 'yes' if the current value of arr has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, otherwise results is a list containing the string 'no'. The list results now contains an additional 'no' string.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t, i, n, and arr remains the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. The list results now contains an additional 'no' string. The conditions for the list results also remain the same as in the initial state.
