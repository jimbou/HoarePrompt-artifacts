Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, arr is a string equal to the second input, results is a list containing 'no' if n is even, otherwise results is a list containing 'yes' if arr has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, otherwise results is a list containing 'no' and an extra 'no', stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t is still an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 2, i is still 2, n is still an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, arr is still a string equal to the second input. The results list has an extra 'no' appended to it, in addition to its previous values. The number of test cases in stdin has not changed.
