The only object in the loop head is variable `i` and list `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `i` is the third element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is equal to 0, `i` is the third element in the list, `n` is an integer equal to the integer value of the last input, `arr` is a string equal to the second last input, `stdin` contains no test cases, `results` is a list that must have at least 3 elements**
