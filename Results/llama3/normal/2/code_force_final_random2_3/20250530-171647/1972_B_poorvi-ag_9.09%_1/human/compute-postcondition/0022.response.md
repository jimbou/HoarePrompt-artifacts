Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, arr is a string equal to the second input, results is a list containing 'no' if n is even, otherwise results is a list containing 'yes' if arr has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, otherwise results is a list containing 'no' and then 'yes', stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.**

The code appends 'yes' to the results list. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.
