To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `t` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. If `n` is odd, `results` is a list containing 'yes' if the current value of `arr` has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, otherwise `results` is a list containing the string 'no'.**
