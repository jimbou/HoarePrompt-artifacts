Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, arr is a string equal to the second input, results is a list containing 'no' if n is even, otherwise results is a list containing 'yes' if arr has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, otherwise results is a list containing 'no', stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value of the first input, and the value of `arr` has been updated to the second input. The value of `results` has been updated based on the value of `n` and the number of 'U' and 'D' characters in `arr`. The value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` has been reduced by two.
