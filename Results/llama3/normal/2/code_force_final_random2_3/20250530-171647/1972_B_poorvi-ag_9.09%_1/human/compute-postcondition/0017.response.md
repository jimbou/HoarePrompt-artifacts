Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 100 and must be greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If n is even, results is a list containing the string 'no'. If n is odd, results is a list containing 'yes' if the current value of arr has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, otherwise results is a list containing the string 'no'. If n is odd and arr has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, results has an additional 'yes' appended to it. If n is odd and arr does not have more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, results has an additional 'no' appended to it.***
