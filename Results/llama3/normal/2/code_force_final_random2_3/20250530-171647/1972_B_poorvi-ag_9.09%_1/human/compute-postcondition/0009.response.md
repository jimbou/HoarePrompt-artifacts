Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'no', `n` is an odd integer, `arr` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, and the number of 'U's in `arr` is less than or equal to the number of 'D's in `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include the string 'no', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an odd integer, `arr` is a string, and the number of 'U's in `arr` is less than or equal to the number of 'D's in `arr` still holds true. Additionally, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
