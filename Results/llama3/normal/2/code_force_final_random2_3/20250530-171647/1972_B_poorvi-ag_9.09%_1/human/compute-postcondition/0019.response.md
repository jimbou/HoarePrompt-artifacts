The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. If `n` is odd, `results` is a list containing 'yes' if the current value of `arr` has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, otherwise `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. If `n` is odd, `results` has an additional 'yes' appended to it if `arr` has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, otherwise `results` has an additional 'no' appended to it. If `n` is even, `results` has an additional 'no' appended to it.**
