Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 and must be greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If n is even, results is a list containing the string 'no'. If n is odd, results is a list containing 'yes' if the current value of arr has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, otherwise results is a list containing the string 'no', and results has an additional 'yes' appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `results` has an additional element `'yes'` appended to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
