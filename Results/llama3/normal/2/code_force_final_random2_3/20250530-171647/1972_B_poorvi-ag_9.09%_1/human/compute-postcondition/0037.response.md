Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string containing only "U" and "D" characters. It then determines for each test case whether the string has more "U" characters than "D" characters if the length of the string is odd, and prints "yes" if true, otherwise prints "no". If the length of the string is even, it always prints "no". The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.**
