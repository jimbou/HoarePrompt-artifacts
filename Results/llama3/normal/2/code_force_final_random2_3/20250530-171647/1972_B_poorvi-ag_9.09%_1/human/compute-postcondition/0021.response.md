Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, `arr` is a string equal to the second input, `results` is a list containing 'no' if `n` is even, otherwise `results` is a list containing 'yes' if `arr` has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, otherwise `results` is a list containing 'no' and an additional 'no' is appended to the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still an integer between 2 and 100 and must be greater than 2, the value of `i` is still 2, the value of `n` is still an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, the value of `arr` is still a string equal to the second input. The value of `results` is still a list containing 'no' if `n` is even, otherwise `results` is a list containing 'yes' if `arr` has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, otherwise `results` is a list containing 'no' but an additional 'no' is appended to the list. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four test cases.
