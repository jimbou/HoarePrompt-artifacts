Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 and must be greater than 0, i is 0, results is an empty list, n is an integer, arr is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 0. The `results` list is still empty as no elements are added to it. The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, so `n` becomes an integer. The second line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `arr`, making `arr` a string. Since two test cases are read from stdin, the number of test cases in stdin decreases by two.
