Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'no', `n` is an even integer, `arr` is a string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include the string 'no'. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being an integer between 1 and 100, `i` still being 0, `n` still being an even integer, and `arr` still being a string. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases.
