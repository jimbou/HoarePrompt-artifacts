To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 1 element, and the first element `i` is being printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` must be the second element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 and is equal to 0, `i` is the second element in the list, `n` is an integer equal to the integer value of the last input, `arr` is a string equal to the second last input, `stdin` contains no test cases, `results` is a list that must have at least 2 elements**
