To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 100, we can conclude that `t` must be greater than 0. Additionally, before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, as it will be incremented in each iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case**
