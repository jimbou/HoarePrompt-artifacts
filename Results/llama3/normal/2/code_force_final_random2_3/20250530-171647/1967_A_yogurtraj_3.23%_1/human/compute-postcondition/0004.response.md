Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is 0, a is a sorted list of integers, r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i, ii is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is 0**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, which is the result of adding `k` divided by `i + 1` to the current value of `a[i]`. The value of `rem` has been updated to `k % (i + 1)`, which is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. The value of `y` has been updated to `n - 1 - i`, which is the result of subtracting `i` from `n - 1`. The value of `k` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
