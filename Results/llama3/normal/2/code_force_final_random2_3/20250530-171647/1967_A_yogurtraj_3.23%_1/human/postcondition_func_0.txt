This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function sorts the integers, then iterates through them to find a value r based on the value of k. If k is not zero, the function prints a calculated value based on the last integer in the sorted list and k. If k is zero, the function prints a calculated value based on r, the remainder of k divided by the number of integers, and the number of remaining integers. The function repeats this process for each test case, emptying the standard input.
