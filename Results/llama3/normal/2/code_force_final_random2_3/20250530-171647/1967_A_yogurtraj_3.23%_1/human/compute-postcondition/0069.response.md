The code prints the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`, where `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. 

Here, `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, `k` is a non-zero integer, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.

So, `r` is the sum of the last element of the list `a` and the integer division of `k` by `n`. 

Then, `(r - 1) * n` is the product of `n` and the difference between `r` and 1.

Finally, `(r - 1) * n + 1` is the sum of the product and 1.

Output: **(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the list a, k is a non-zero integer, and n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
