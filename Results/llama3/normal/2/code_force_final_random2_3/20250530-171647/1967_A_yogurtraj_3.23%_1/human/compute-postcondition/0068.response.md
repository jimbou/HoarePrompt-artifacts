Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is not 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `ii` is 2, and `i` is `n - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be the sum of the last element of the sorted list `a` and the integer division of `k` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
