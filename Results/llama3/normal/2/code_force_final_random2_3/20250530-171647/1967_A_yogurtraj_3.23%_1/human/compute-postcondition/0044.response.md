The code prints the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`, where `r` is an integer equal to `a[n - 1] + k // n`. 

Here, `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, `k` is an integer not equal to 0, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.

Since the exact values of `a[n - 1]`, `k`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `r`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`.

Output: **(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list a, k is an integer not equal to 0, and n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
