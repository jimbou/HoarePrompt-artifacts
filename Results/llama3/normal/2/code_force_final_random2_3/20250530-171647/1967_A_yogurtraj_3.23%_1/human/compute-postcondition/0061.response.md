Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, ii is 2, i is 1. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is a[1] + k // 2, rem is k % 2, and y is n - 2. Otherwise, k is decreased by 3 times the difference between the second and first elements of a, r is the second element of a.***
