The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, ii is 1, i is 2**
