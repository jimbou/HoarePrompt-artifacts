Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2. The current value of `i` is 0 and the current value of `a[i + 1] - a[i]` is greater than `k / (i + 1)`***
