Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 0, and the product of the next index `i + 1` and the difference between the next element `a[i + 1]` and the current element `a[i]` is greater than `k`.**
