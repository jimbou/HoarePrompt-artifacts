The only object in the loop head is variable  ii and the input from stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable ii and the input from stdin. If the input from stdin is greater than ii the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, ii is 0 and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the ii is 1 and stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, ii is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, i is n - 1**
