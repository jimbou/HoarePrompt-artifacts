Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `ii` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by the product of `(i + 1)` and `(a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is the integer at index `i + 1` in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `ii` is 0.***
