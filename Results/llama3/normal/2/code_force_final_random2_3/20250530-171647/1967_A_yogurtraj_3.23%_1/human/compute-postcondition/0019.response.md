To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given information and the print statement itself.

Given:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `k` is not 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- `rem` is an integer, but its value isn't directly relevant to the print statement.
- `y` is an integer, but its value isn't directly relevant to the print statement.
- `ii` is 0, but its value isn't directly relevant to the print statement.
- `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, but this information isn't directly relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is `n - 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1)
```

Let's analyze the components of the print statement:
- `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`. This means `r` is the sum of the last element of the sorted list `a` and the integer division of `k` by `n`.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` involves arithmetic operations on `r` and `n`.

To describe the output, we need to consider the values of `r` and `n`. Since `r` depends on the last element of `a`, the value of `k`, and the value of `n`, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, the output will be a calculated value based on these variables.

Given the formula `(r - 1) * n + 1`, the output will be the result of this calculation, which involves the last element of the sorted list `a`, the value of `k`, and the value of `n`.

Therefore, the output will be a specific numerical value that results from the calculation involving `r` and `n`.

Output: **(a[n-1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n-1] is the last element of the sorted list a, k is not 0, and n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
