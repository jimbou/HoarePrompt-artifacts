Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is 2. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is the smallest integer in a plus k divided by 3, rem is the remainder of k divided by 3, and y is n - 3. Otherwise, k is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 times the difference between the third and second elements of a, r is the third element of a, rem is 0, y is 0, and ii is 0.**
