Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, ii is 2, i is 2. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is equal to a[2] + k // 3, rem is equal to k % 3, and y is equal to n - 3. Otherwise, k is updated to its original value minus 3 times the difference between the third and second elements of a, and r is set to the third element of a.***
