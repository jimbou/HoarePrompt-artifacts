To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 0**
