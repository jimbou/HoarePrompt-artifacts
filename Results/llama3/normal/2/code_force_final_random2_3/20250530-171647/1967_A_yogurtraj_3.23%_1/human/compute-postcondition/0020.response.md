Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is not 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `ii` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is `n - 1`, and this is printed: the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` which is equal to `((a[n - 1] + k // n) - 1) * n + 1`**
