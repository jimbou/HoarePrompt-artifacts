Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer equal to the smallest element in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 2, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is an integer, `rem` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `ii` is 2, `i` is 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is equal to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, `k` is equal to its original value minus the product of `i + 1` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, `r` is the second smallest element in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, ii is 2, i is 1. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is a[1] + k // 2, rem is k % 2, and y is n - 2. Otherwise, k is decreased by 3 times the difference between the second and first elements of a, r is the second element of a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, ii is 2, i is 2. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is equal to a[2] + k // 3, rem is equal to k % 3, and y is equal to n - 3. Otherwise, k is updated to its original value minus 3 times the difference between the third and second elements of a, and r is set to the third element of a.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
