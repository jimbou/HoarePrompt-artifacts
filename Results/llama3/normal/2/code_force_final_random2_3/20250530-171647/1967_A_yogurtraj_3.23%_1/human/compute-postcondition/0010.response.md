Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer equal to its original value minus (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), a is a sorted list of integers, r is the integer at index i + 1 in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated by subtracting the product of `(i + 1)` and the difference between the integers at indices `i + 1` and `i` in the sorted list `a`. The value of `r` has been updated to be the integer at index `i + 1` in `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
