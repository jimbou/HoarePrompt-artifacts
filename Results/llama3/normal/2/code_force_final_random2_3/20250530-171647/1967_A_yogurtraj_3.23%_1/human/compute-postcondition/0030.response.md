Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2. The product of the difference between the element at index `i+1` and the element at index `i` in list `a` and the value of `i+1` is less than or equal to `k`***
