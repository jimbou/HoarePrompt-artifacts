Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the smallest integer in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `ii` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by the product of `(i + 1)` and `(a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is the integer at index `i + 1` in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `ii` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is 1. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i. Otherwise, k is decreased by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), r is the integer at index i + 1 in a, rem is 0, y is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a, rem is 0, y is 0, ii is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is 2. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is the smallest integer in a plus k divided by 3, rem is the remainder of k divided by 3, and y is n - 3. Otherwise, k is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 times the difference between the third and second elements of a, r is the third element of a, rem is 0, y is 0, and ii is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
