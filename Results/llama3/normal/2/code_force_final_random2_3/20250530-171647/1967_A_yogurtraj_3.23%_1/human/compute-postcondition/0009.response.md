Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is 0, a is a sorted list of integers, r is a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is k % (i + 1), y is n - 1 - i, ii is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be the sum of the `i`-th element of `a` and the integer division of `k` by `i + 1`. The value of `rem` has been updated to be the remainder of the division of `k` by `i + 1`. The value of `y` has been updated to be the difference between `n` and `i + 1`. The value of `k` has been reset to 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `ii`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
