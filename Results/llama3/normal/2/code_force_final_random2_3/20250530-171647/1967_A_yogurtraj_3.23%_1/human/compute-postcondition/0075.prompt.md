Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= 10^12). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^12).
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, ii is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is n - 1. If k is not 0, the value of the expression (r - 1) * n + 1 which is equal to ((a[n - 1] + k // n) - 1) * n + 1 is printed. If k is 0, the value of the expression (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, ii is 1, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2. If k is not equal to 0, then the program prints ((a[n - 1] + k // n) - 1) * n + 1. If k is equal to 0, then the program prints (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, ii is 2, and i is n - 1. If k is not 0, then the value (a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 is printed. If k is 0, then the value (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
