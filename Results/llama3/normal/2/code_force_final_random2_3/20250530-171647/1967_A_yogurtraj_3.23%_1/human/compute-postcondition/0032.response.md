Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, ii is 1, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is equal to a[i] + k // (i + 1), rem is equal to k % (i + 1), y is equal to n - 1 - i. Otherwise, k is equal to its original value minus the product of the difference between the element at index i+1 and the element at index i in list a and the value of i+1, r is the element at index i+1 in list a, rem is 0, y is 0.***
