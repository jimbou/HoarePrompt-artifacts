Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, ii is 2, and i is n - 1. If k is not 0, then the value (a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 is printed. If k is 0, then the value (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y is printed.***
