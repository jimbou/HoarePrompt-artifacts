Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, r is an integer, rem is an integer, y is an integer, ii is 1, i is 1. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then k is 0, r is equal to a[1] + k // 2, rem is equal to k % 2, and y is equal to n - 2. Otherwise, k is equal to its original value minus (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), r is equal to a[i + 1], and rem is an integer.***
