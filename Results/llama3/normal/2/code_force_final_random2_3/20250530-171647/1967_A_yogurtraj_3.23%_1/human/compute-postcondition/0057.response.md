Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is an integer, `rem` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `ii` is 2, `i` is 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is equal to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, `k` is equal to its original value minus the product of `i + 1` and the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, `r` is the second smallest element in `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.***
