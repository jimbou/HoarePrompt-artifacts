Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is 0, a is a sorted list of integers, r is the smallest integer in a plus k divided by 3, rem is the remainder of k divided by 3, y is n - 3, ii is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is 2**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be the smallest integer in `a` plus `k` divided by 3, and the value of `rem` has been updated to be the remainder of `k` divided by 3. The value of `y` has been updated to be `n - 3`. The value of `k` has been reset to 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `ii`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` has been reduced by 1.
