Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is:

3 4
6 1 8

The program outputs 15, but the correct output should be 22. The program is not correctly calculating the maximum score that can be obtained by rearranging the cards.

The issue lies in the way the program is calculating the maximum score. It is not considering all possible rearrangements of the cards, but rather only considering the rearrangement where the cards are sorted in ascending order. This is not sufficient to guarantee the maximum score.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to consider all possible rearrangements of the cards and calculate the maximum score that can be obtained. This can be done by using a more complex algorithm, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
