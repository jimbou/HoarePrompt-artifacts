The code `r = a[n - 1] + k // n` assigns a new value to the variable `r`. The value of `r` is now the sum of the last element of the sorted list `a` (which is `a[n - 1]`) and the integer division of `k` by `n` (which is `k // n`).

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer not equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is an integer equal to `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.**
