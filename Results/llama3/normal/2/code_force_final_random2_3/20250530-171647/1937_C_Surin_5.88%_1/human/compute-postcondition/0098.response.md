Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to n, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1` if `r` is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise `v1` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `prev` is either `i-1` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, stdin is empty, and the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r` in the last iteration, and `prev` is either `j` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `j-1` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, for `j` ranging from 1 to `n-1`, and `r` is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either `i-1` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, and `v1` is either `n-1` if `r` is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise `v1` is 0, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer has been flushed. This means that any output that was buffered (i.e., not immediately printed to the console) has now been printed. The values of all variables remain the same, and the stdin is still empty. The output is still a series of strings in the specified format, and the last printed string is still in the format "! [prev] [v1]".
