Output State: **n is at least 3, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is 2, v2 is 2, i is 2, prev is n-1 if r is '<', otherwise prev is either 0 or n-1, r is an empty string, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to 2, which is the value of `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the condition for `prev` still depends on the value of `r`, which is an empty string.
