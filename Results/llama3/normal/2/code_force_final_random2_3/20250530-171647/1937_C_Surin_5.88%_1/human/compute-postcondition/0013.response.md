Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

The print statement is `print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')`. This is a formatted string that will be printed.

The values of `v1` and `v2` are determined by the condition `if the current value of 'r' is '<'`. If this condition is true, then `v1` is 1 and `v2` is 2. Otherwise, the values of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged.

However, the initial state does not provide the current value of `r`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of `v1` and `v2`.

But, we can still describe the output based on the given information. The output will be a string that starts with '?' followed by the values of `v1` and `v2`, which are either 1 and 2 or some other values that are not specified.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] (where v1 and v2 are either 1 and 2 or some other values)**
