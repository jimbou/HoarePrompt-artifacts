Output State: **n is an integer, kp is 2, g is 0, v1 is n-1, v2 is n-1, i is n, prev is either i-1 or 0 or i-2 depending on the value of r, stdin is empty, and the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 and prev is either j if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or j-1 depending on whether r is '>' or not, for j ranging from 1 to n-1, and r is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either i-1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or i-2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, and v1 is n-1, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the final state is as follows: the value of n remains unchanged, kp is still 2, g is still 0, v1 has been updated to n-1, v2 has been updated to n-1, i has been updated to n, and prev is either i-1 or 0 or i-2 depending on the value of r. The input buffer is empty, and the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 and prev is either j if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or j-1 depending on whether r is '>' or not, for j ranging from 1 to n-1. The output buffer has been flushed, and the final output is "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either i-1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or i-2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, and v1 is n-1.
