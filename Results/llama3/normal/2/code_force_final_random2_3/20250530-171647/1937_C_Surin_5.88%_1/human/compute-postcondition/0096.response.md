The code prints a string indicating the final values of `prev` and `v1`. The value of `prev` is either `i-1` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise it is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not. The value of `v1` is either `n-1` if `r` is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise it is 0.

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where prev is either i-1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or i-2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, and v1 is either n-1 if r is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise v1 is 0)**
