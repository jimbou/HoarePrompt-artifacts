Output State: **n is greater than 3, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if r is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise v1 is 0, v2 is n-1, i is 3, prev is 3, stdin is empty, and the output is "? [v1] [1] [v1] [0]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r in the last iteration, and this is printed: "? [v1] [2] [v1] [0]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r in the last iteration, and this is printed: "? [v1] [3] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r in the last iteration, and prev is 3, r is a string containing the user's input**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `prev` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The output remains the same as before, with the last line printed being "? [v1] [3] [v1] [prev]" where `prev` is now 3.
