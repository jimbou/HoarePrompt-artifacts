Output State: **`n` is at least n, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is n-1, `v2` is n-1, `i` is n-1, `prev` is 0, stdin is empty, and the printed output is "? n-2 n-2 n-1 n-1" if the current value of r is '<', otherwise the printed output remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the printed output condition based on the value of `r` is still applicable.
