Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `prev` is 0, stdin is empty, and the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1` and `prev` is either `j` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `j-1` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, for `j` ranging from 1 to `n-1`, and `r` is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either `i-1` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, and `v1` is `n-1`, and the output buffer has been flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input()
    if r == '>':
        prev = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 1, kp is 2, g is 0, v1 is n-1, v2 is n-1, i is 1, stdin is empty, and the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 and prev is either j if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or j-1 depending on whether r is '>' or not, for j ranging from 1 to n-1, and r is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either i-1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or i-2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, and v1 is n-1, and the output buffer has been flushed, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]", and r is a string containing the user's input. If r is '>', then prev is 1, otherwise prev remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 2, kp is 2, g is 0, v1 is n-1, v2 is n-1, i is 2, stdin is empty, the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 and prev is either j if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or j-1 depending on whether r is '>' or not, for j ranging from 1 to n-1, and r is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either i-1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or i-2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, and v1 is n-1, and the output buffer has been flushed, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]", and r is a string containing the user's input. If r is '>', then prev is 1, otherwise prev remains 0, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [2] [n-1] [prev]" where prev is either 1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev remains 0, and r is a string containing the user's input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 3, kp is 2, g is 0, v1 is n-1, v2 is n-1, i is 3, stdin is empty, the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 and prev is either j if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or j-1 depending on whether r is '>' or not, for j ranging from 1 to n-1, and r is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either i-1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or i-2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, and v1 is n-1, and the output buffer has been flushed, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]", and r is a string containing the user's input. If r is '>', then prev is 1, otherwise prev remains 0, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [2] [n-1] [prev]" where prev is either 1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev remains 0, and r is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [3] [n-1] [prev]" where prev is either 1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev remains 0, and r is a string containing the user's input, and the output buffer has been flushed, and r is a string containing the user's input. If r is not '>', then the program does not execute any additional operations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
