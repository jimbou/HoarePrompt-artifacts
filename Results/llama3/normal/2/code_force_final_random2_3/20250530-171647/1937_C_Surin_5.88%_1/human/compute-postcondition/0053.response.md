The code changes the value of `v2` to `i`. The value of `i` is 1. Therefore, `v2` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state is: `n` is at least 2, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is 1, `i` is 1, `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the value of `r`, `stdin` is empty.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is 1, `i` is 1, `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the value of `r`, `stdin` is empty.**
