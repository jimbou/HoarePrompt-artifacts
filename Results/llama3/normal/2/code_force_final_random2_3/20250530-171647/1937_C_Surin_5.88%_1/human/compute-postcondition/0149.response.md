Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (n) followed by n integers representing a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, it finds the indices of the maximum and second maximum elements in the permutation and prints them in the format "! [prev] [v1]" to standard output, where `prev` is the index of the maximum element and `v1` is the index of the second maximum element. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases and ensures that the output buffer is flushed after each test case.**
