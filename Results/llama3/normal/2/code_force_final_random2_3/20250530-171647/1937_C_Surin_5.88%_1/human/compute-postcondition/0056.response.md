Output State: **n is at least 2, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is 0, v2 is 1, i is 1, prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r, stdin contains 1 input: an empty string, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1"**

The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, ensures that the output buffer is cleared, and the printed message "? 0 0 1 1" is displayed immediately. This line does not affect any variables.

The second line, `r = input('')`, reads an empty string from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. Since `stdin` is empty, the input will be an empty string. This line modifies the value of `r` and adds an empty string to `stdin`.

The initial state of the variables remains unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The only changes are the assignment of an empty string to `r` and the addition of an empty string to `stdin`.
