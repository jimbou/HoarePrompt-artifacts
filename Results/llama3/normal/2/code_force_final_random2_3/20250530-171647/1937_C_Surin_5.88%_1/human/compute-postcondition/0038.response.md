The code `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. The value of `i` is 2. Therefore, the value of `prev` is now 2.

The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state is: n is at least 3, kp is 0, g is 0, v1 is n-1, v2 is n-1, i is 2, stdin is empty, r is either '>' or '<', and prev is 2.
