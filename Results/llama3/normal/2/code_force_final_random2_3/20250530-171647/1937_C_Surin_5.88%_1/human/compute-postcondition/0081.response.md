Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `prev` is 1, stdin is empty, the output is "? [0] [1] [0] [0]", and the current value of `r` is '>'**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output and stdin also remain the same.
