Output State: **n is at least n, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is 0, v2 is n-1, i is n, prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r, stdin is empty**.

In this final state, the value of `n` has been updated to be at least `n`, `kp` remains 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is now 0, `v2` is still `n-1`, `i` is `n`, and `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the value of `r`. Stdin is now empty because the first line of the code reads a value from stdin.
