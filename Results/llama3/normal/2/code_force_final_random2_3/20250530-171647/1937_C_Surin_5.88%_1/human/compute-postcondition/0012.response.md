Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, if the current value of `r` is '<', then `v1` is 1, `v2` is 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: an empty string, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 2". Otherwise, the values of `v1`, `v2`, `i`, stdin and the printed output remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `n` is still at least 3, `kp` and `g` are still 0. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 1, `v2` is now 2 (because it's assigned the value of `i`, which is 2), `i` is still 2, and the printed output is updated to "? 0 0 1 2". If `r` is not '<', then all the variables and the printed output remain unchanged.
