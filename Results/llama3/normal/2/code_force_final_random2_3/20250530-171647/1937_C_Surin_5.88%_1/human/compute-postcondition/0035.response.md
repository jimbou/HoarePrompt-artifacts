Based on the precondition, we can analyze the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

* `v1` is `n-1`, where `n` is at least 3.
* `i` is 2.
* `prev` is either 1 or 0, depending on the value of `r`. Since the current value of `r` is '>', `prev` is 1.

Now, let's substitute these values into the print statement:

`print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`

This will print:

`? (n-1) 2 (n-1) 1`

Since `n` is at least 3, `n-1` will be at least 2.

Output: **? (n-1) 2 (n-1) 1 (where n-1 is at least 2)**
