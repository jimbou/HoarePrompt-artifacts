Output State: **n is at least n, kp is 0, g is 0, v1 is n-1, v2 is n-1, i is n-1, stdin is empty, and the printed output is "? n-2 n-2 n-1 n-1" if the current value of r is '<', otherwise the printed output remains unchanged.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

* The value of `n` will be at least `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n-1` times.
* The values of `kp` and `g` will remain unchanged at 0.
* The value of `v1` will be `n-1`, which is the last value assigned to it in the loop.
* The value of `v2` will also be `n-1`, which is the last value assigned to it in the loop.
* The value of `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last value of the loop counter.
* The `stdin` will be empty, as all inputs have been consumed by the loop.
* The printed output will be "? n-2 n-2 n-1 n-1" if the current value of `r` is '<', otherwise the printed output will remain unchanged.
