Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `prev` is 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer, and the following is printed: "? n-1 1 n-1 0". The current value of `r` is '>'**

The code only updates the value of `prev` to be equal to `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The input in stdin and the printed message also remain the same.
