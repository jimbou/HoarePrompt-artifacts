Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases), I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least n, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the value of `r`, stdin is empty, and the printed output is "! prev v1" where `prev` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the value of `r`, and `v1` is `n-1`, and the output buffer has been flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to n, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1` if `r` is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise `v1` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `prev` is either `i-1` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, stdin is empty, and the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r` in the last iteration, and `prev` is either `j` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `j-1` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, for `j` ranging from 1 to `n-1`, and `r` is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either `i-1` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, and `v1` is either `n-1` if `r` is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise `v1` is 0, and the output buffer has been flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, stdin is empty, the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1` and `prev` is either `j` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `j-1` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, for `j` ranging from 1 to `n-1`, and `r` is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either `i-1` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, and `v1` is `n-1`, and the output buffer has been flushed, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]", and `r` is a string containing the user's input. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1, otherwise `prev` remains 0, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [2] [n-1] [prev]" where `prev` is either 1 if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` remains 0, and `r` is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [3] [n-1] [prev]" where `prev` is either 1 if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` remains 0, and `r` is a string containing the user's input, and the output buffer has been flushed, and `r` is a string containing the user's input. If `r` is not '>', then the program does not execute any additional operations, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either 1 if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` remains 0, and `v1` is `n-1`, and the output buffer has been flushed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
