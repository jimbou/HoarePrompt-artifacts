The code prints a formatted string containing the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`. 
`v1` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r` in the last iteration, 
`i` is 3, 
`prev` is either 0 or 2 depending on whether `r` is '>' or not.
Output: **? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r in the last iteration, and prev is either 0 or 2 depending on whether r is '>' or not)**
