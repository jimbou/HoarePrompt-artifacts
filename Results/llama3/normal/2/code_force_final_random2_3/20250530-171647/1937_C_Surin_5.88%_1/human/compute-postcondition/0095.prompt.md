Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is at least n, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is n-1 if r is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise v1 is 0, `v2` is n-1, `i` is n, `prev` is 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input()
    if r == '>':
        prev = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 1, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if r is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise v1 is 0, v2 is n-1, i is 1, prev is 0, stdin is empty, and the output is "? [v1] [1] [v1] [0]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r in the last iteration, and r is a string containing the user's input

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1` if `r` is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise `v1` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is 2, `prev` is either 0 or 2 depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, stdin is empty, and the output is "? [v1] [1] [v1] [0]" where `v1` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r` in the last iteration, and `r` is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "? [v1] [2] [v1] [0]" where `v1` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r` in the last iteration, and `r` is a string containing the user's input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is greater than 3, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if r is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise v1 is 0, v2 is n-1, i is 3, prev is either 3 if r is '>', otherwise prev is either 0 or 2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, stdin is empty, and the output is "? [v1] [1] [v1] [0]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r in the last iteration, and this is printed: "? [v1] [2] [v1] [0]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r in the last iteration, and this is printed: "? [v1] [3] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r in the last iteration, and prev is either 3 if r is '>', otherwise prev is either 0 or 2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, r is a string containing the user's input




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
