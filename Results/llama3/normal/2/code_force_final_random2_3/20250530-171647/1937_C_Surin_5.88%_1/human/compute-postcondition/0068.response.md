The code `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Since `i` is 3, `v2` is now 3. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, if `r` is '<', then `v1` is 2, otherwise `v1` is 0, `v2` is 3, `i` is 3, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is '<', otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `n-1`, `r` is an empty string, stdin is empty**
