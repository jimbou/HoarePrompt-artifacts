The code prints a formatted string containing a question mark followed by the values of `v1` and `v2`, each repeated twice. Since `v1` is 2 and `v2` is 3, the output will be "? 2 2 3 3". The value of `r` does not affect the output in this case because the condition that checks `r` is not present in the given code snippet.

Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
