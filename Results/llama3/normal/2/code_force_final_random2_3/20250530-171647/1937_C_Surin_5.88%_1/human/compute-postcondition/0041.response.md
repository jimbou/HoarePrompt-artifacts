Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables involved in the print statement.

* `v1` is `n-1`, where `n` is greater than 3.
* `i` is 3.
* `prev` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `r`, but since `r` is '>', `prev` is 2.

Now, let's substitute these values into the print statement:

`print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`

This will print a string with the following values:

* `v1` is `n-1`, which is a value greater than 2 (since `n` is greater than 3).
* `i` is 3.
* `v1` is again `n-1`, the same value as the first `v1`.
* `prev` is 2.

So, the output will be a string with these values:

Output: **? [n-1] 3 [n-1] 2 (where n-1 is the value of v1, which is n-1)**
