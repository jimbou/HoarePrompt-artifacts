To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is n-1, `v2` is n-1, `i` is 1, `prev` is 0, stdin is empty, and the printed output is "? n-2 n-2 n-1 n-1" if the current value of r is '<', otherwise the printed output remains unchanged.**
