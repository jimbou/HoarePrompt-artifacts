To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 1, and the state of `i` to be 1, because the loop starts from 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is n-1 if r is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise v1 is 0, `v2` is n-1, `i` is 1, `prev` is 0, stdin is empty**
