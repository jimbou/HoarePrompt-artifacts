The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **n is greater than 3, kp is 0, g is 0, v1 is n-1, v2 is n-1, i is 3, stdin is empty, and if r is '>', then prev is 2, otherwise prev is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of r.**
