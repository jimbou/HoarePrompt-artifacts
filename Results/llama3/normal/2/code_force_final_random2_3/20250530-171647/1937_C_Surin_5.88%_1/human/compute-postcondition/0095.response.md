Output State: **n is greater than or equal to n, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if r is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise v1 is 0, v2 is n-1, i is n, prev is either i-1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or i-2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, stdin is empty, and the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r in the last iteration, and prev is either j if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or j-1 depending on whether r is '>' or not, for j ranging from 1 to n-1, and r is a string containing the user's input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains the same as the initial state.
* The value of `kp` remains 1.
* The value of `g` remains 0.
* The value of `v1` depends on the value of `r` in the last iteration. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is `n-1`, otherwise `v1` is 0.
* The value of `v2` remains `n-1`.
* The value of `i` is now `n`.
* The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r` in the last iteration. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is `i-1`, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not.
* The standard input `stdin` is empty.
* The output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r` in the last iteration, and `prev` is either `j` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `j-1` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, for `j` ranging from 1 to `n-1`. The user's input is stored in the string `r`.
