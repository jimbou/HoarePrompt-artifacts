Output State: **n is at least 2, kp is 0, g is 0, v1 is 1, v2 is 1, i is 1, stdin contains 1 input: an empty string, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1". The current value of r is '<'.**

The code assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Since `v2` is 1, `v1` is now also 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `v1`.
