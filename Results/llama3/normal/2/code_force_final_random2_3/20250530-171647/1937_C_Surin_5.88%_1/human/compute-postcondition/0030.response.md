Output State: **n is at least 2, kp is 0, g is 0, v1 is n-1, v2 is n-1, i is 1, prev is 0, stdin contains 1 input: an integer, and the following is printed: "? n-1 1 n-1 0"**

The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, ensures that any buffered output is immediately written to the standard output. Since the initial state already includes the printed output "? n-1 1 n-1 0", this line does not change the output but ensures it is displayed immediately.

The second line, `r = input()`, reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `r`. Since stdin is initially empty, this line will wait for user input. After the user provides an integer, it is assigned to `r`, and stdin will contain no more inputs.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `n`, `kp`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `i`, and `prev` remain unchanged.
