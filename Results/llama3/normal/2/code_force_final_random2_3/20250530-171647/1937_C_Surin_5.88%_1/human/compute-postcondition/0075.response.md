Output State: **`n` is at least n, `kp` is 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is n-1 if r is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise v1 is 0, `v2` is n-1, `i` is n, `prev` is 0, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `prev` has been updated to 0, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The condition for `v1` still depends on the value of `r` in the last iteration.
