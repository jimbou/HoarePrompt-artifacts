Postcondition: ***n is at least 3, kp is 1, g is 0, i is 3, prev is either 0 or n-1, r is a string containing user input, stdin is empty. If the user input r is '<', then v1 and v2 are both set to 3. Otherwise, the values of v1 and v2 remain unchanged, with v1 being 0 and v2 being 3. In both cases, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" is printed, reflecting the updated values of v1 and v2.***
