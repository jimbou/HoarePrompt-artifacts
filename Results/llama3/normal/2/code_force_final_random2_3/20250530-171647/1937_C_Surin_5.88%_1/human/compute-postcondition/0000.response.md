Output State: **stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases), I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin**.

The code defines two lambda functions, I and R. The I function reads a line from stdin, splits it into a list of integers, and returns this list. The R function reads a single integer from stdin and returns it. Neither function modifies any existing variables or changes the state of stdin beyond consuming input. The initial state of stdin remains unchanged, as the code does not execute any operations that would alter it.
