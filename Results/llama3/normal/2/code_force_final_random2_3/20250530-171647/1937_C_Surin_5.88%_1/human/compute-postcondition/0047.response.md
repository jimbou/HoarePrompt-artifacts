The code prints a formatted string containing three values: '!', the value of `prev`, and the value of `v1`. 

The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is '<', then `prev` is either 0 or n-1. However, since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `prev`. 

The value of `v1` is n-1.

Output: **! [prev] [n-1] (where prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r, and n-1 is the value of v1)**
