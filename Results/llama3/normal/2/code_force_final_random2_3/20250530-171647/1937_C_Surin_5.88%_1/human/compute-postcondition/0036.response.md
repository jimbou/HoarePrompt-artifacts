Output: **`n` is at least 3, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is n-1, `v2` is n-1, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains 1 input: an integer, and the following is printed: "? n-1 1 n-1 0". If the current value of `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [2] [n-1] [prev]" where prev is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of r**
