Output State: **n is at least 3, kp is 0, g is 0, r is an empty string, v1 is 1, v2 is 2, i is 2, stdin is empty, and the printed output is "? 1 1 2 2" if the current value of r is '<', otherwise the printed output remains unchanged.**

The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, ensures that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. This line does not affect any variables.

The second line, `r = input('')`, assigns the input from stdin to the variable `r`. Since stdin contains an empty string, `r` becomes an empty string. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `i`, and the printed output remain unchanged, as the condition for changing them (`r` being '<') is not met.
