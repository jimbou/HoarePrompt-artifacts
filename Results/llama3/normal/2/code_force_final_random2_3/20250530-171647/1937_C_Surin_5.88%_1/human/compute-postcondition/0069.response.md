The code prints a formatted string containing four values: `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`. Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of these variables.

Since `r` is an empty string, the condition `if r is '<'` is not met, so `v1` is assigned the value 0.

The value of `v2` is given as 3.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string '? 0 0 3 3'.

Output: **? 0 0 3 3**
