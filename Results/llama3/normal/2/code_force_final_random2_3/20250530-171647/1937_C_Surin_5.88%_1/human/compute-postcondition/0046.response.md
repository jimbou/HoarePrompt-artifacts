Output State: **n is at least n, kp is 0, g is 0, v1 is n-1, v2 is n-1, i is n, prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r, stdin is empty, and the printed output is "? n-2 n-2 n-1 n-1" if the current value of r is '<', otherwise the printed output remains unchanged.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be as follows:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
* The values of `kp` and `g` remain 0, as they are not modified within the loop.
* The values of `v1` and `v2` remain `n-1`, as they are not modified within the loop.
* The value of `i` will be `n`, as the loop iterates from 1 to `n`.
* The value of `prev` will be either 0 or `n-1`, depending on the value of `r`. If `r` is '>', then `prev` will be `n-1`, otherwise it will remain 0.
* The stdin will be empty, as all inputs have been consumed by the loop.
* The printed output will be "? n-2 n-2 n-1 n-1" if the current value of `r` is '<', otherwise the printed output remains unchanged.
