Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables as follows:

* `v1` is either `n-1` or `0`, depending on the value of `r` in the last iteration. Since `r` is not specified, we can't determine the exact value of `v1`. However, we can describe it as "either `n-1` or `0`, depending on the value of `r`".
* `i` is `1`.
* `prev` is `0`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`

The print statement uses an f-string to format the output. The `{}` placeholders will be replaced with the values of the variables inside them.

So, the output will be:

`?` followed by the value of `v1` (either `n-1` or `0`), followed by the value of `i` (`1`), followed by the value of `v1` again (either `n-1` or `0`), followed by the value of `prev` (`0`).

Output: **? [either n-1 or 0] 1 [either n-1 or 0] 0**
