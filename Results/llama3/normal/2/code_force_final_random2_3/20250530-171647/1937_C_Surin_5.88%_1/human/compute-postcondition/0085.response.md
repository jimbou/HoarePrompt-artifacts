Output: **n is greater than 2, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if r is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise v1 is 0, v2 is n-1, i is 2, prev is 0, stdin is empty, and the output is "? [v1] [1] [v1] [0]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r in the last iteration, and r is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "? [v1] [2] [v1] [0]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r in the last iteration**
