To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `kp` and the expression `int(input())`, which depends on the state of `stdin`.

Since `stdin` contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases), we need to ensure that this input is available and is a positive integer (since the loop will not execute if the input is 0 or negative).

The functions `I` and `R` are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`stdin` contains a positive integer (the number of test cases), `kp` is 0**

Note that we set `kp` to 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable, and ensure that `stdin` contains a positive integer, which will allow the loop to execute at least once.
