Output State: **n is at least 2, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is 1, v2 is 1, i is 1, prev is n-1, stdin contains 1 input: an empty string, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and the current value of r is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to be equal to `v2`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains an empty string as input, and the printed output and the current value of `r` also remain the same.
