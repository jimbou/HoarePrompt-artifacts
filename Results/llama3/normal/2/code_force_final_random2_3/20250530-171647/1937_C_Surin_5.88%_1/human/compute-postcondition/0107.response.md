Output State: **n is an integer that must be greater than 1, kp is 2, g is 0, v1 is 1, v2 is 1, i is 1, prev is either i-1 or 0 or i-2 depending on the value of r, stdin is empty, and the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is 1 and prev is either j if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or j-1 depending on whether r is '>' or not, for j ranging from 1 to n-1, and r is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either i-1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or i-2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, and v1 is 1, and the output buffer has been flushed, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and the current value of r is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of v1 has been updated to 1, which is the value of v2. The other variables remain unchanged. The output is still a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]", but now v1 is 1. The prev value is still dependent on the value of r. The output buffer has been flushed, and the current value of r is still '<'.
