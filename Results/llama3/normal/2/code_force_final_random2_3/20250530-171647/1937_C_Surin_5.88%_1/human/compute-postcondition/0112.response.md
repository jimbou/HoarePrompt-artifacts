Output: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is either 0 or 1, `v2` is 2, `i` is 2, `prev` is either `i-1` or 0 or `i-2` depending on the value of `r`, `stdin` is empty, and the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either 0 or 1 and `prev` is either `j` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `j-1` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, for `j` ranging from 1 to `n-1`, and `r` is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either `i-1` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, and `v1` is either 0 or 1, and the output buffer has been flushed, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and the current value of `r` is either '<' or the previous value of `r`, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where `v1` is either 0 or 1 and `v2` is 2.**
