Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality to find the indices of the maximum and second maximum elements in the permutation and prints them in the required format. The program also ensures that the output buffer is flushed after each test case to prevent idleness limit exceeded errors.

The program uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum element in the permutation, which is efficient and correct. It then finds the second maximum element by comparing each element with the maximum element, which is also correct.

The program also handles the input and output correctly, reading the test cases from standard input and printing the results to standard output in the required format.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
