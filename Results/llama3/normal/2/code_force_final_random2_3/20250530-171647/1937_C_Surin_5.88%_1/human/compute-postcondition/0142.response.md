Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is 3, `prev` is 3, stdin is empty, the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1` and `prev` is either `j` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `j-1` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, for `j` ranging from 1 to `n-1`, and `r` is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either `i-1` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, and `v1` is `n-1`, and the output buffer has been flushed, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]", and `r` is a string containing the user's input. If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1, otherwise `prev` remains 0, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [2] [n-1] [prev]" where `prev` is either 1 if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` remains 0, and `r` is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [3] [n-1] [prev]" where `prev` is either 1 if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` remains 0, and `r` is a string containing the user's input, and the output buffer has been flushed, and `r` is a string containing the user's input.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that a new variable `prev` has been introduced and assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. The rest of the state remains unchanged.
