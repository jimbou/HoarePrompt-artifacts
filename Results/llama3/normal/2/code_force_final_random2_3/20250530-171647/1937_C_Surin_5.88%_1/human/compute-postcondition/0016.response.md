Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `r` is an empty string, `v1` is 2, `v2` is 2, `i` is 2, stdin is empty, and the printed output is "? 1 1 2 2" if the current value of `r` is '<', otherwise the printed output remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `v1` has been updated to be equal to `v2`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the printed output condition remains the same.
