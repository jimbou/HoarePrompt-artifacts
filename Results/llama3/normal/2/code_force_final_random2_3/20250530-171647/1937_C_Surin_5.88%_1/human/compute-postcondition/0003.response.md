According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2. Also, the variable `i` is introduced in the loop head, which is initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**
