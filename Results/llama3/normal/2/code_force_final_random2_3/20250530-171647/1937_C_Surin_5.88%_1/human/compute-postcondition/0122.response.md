Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 3, kp is 2, g is 0, v1 is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, v2 is 3, i is 3, prev is either i-1 or 0 or i-2 depending on the value of r, stdin is empty, the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0, 1 or 2 and prev is either j if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or j-1 depending on whether r is '>' or not, for j ranging from 1 to n-1, and r is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either i-1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or i-2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, and v1 is either 0, 1 or 2, and the output buffer has been flushed, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", and the current value of r is either '<' or the previous value of r, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is either 0, 1 or 2 and v2 is 3, and the output buffer has been flushed again, and r is assigned the user's input, and this is printed: "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" where v1 is either 0, 1 or 2 and v2 is 3. If r is '<', then v1 is 3.**
