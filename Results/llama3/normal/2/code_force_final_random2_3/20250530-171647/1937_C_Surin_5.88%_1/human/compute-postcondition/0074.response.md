Output State: **n is at least n, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if r is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise v1 is 0, v2 is n-1, i is n, prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r, stdin is empty**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `kp`, `g`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The value of `v2` will be `n-1`, and the value of `i` will be `n`. The value of `v1` will depend on the user input `r` in the last iteration: if `r` is '<', then `v1` will be `n-1`, otherwise `v1` will remain 0. The value of `prev` will also depend on the value of `r` and can be either 0 or `n-1`.
