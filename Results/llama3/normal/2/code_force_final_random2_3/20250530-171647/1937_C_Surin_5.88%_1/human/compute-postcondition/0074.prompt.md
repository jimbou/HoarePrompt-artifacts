Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is at least n, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is 0, v2 is n-1, i is n, prev is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of r, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    v2 = i
    print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input('')
    if r == '<':
        v1 = v2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is at least 2, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is 1 if r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0, v2 is 1, i is 1, prev is n-1 if r is '<', otherwise prev is either 0 or n-1, stdin contains 1 input: an empty string, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1"

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 3, kp is 1, g is 0, if r is '<', then v1 is 2, otherwise v1 is 0, v2 is 2, i is 2, prev is n-1 if r is '<', otherwise prev is either 0 or n-1, r is an empty string, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is at least 3, kp is 1, g is 0, i is 3, prev is either 0 or n-1, r is a string containing user input, stdin is empty. If the user input r is '<', then v1 and v2 are both set to 3. Otherwise, the values of v1 and v2 remain unchanged, with v1 being 0 and v2 being 3. In both cases, the string "? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2]" is printed, reflecting the updated values of v1 and v2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
