To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the variables and their values based on the initial state:

1. `v1`: This variable is assigned a value based on the condition related to `r`. If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 1; otherwise, `v1` is 0.

2. `v2`: The value of `v2` is explicitly given as 2.

Given these values, the print statement `print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')` will output a string formatted with these values.

Since `v1` can be either 0 or 1 based on the condition related to `r`, and `v2` is always 2, the output will be one of two possible strings:

- If `r` is '<', then `v1` is 1, and the output will be `? 1 1 2 2`.
- If `r` is not '<', then `v1` is 0, and the output will be `? 0 0 2 2`.

However, the initial state also mentions that this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1", which seems to contradict the given values of `v1` and `v2`. Given the explicit values of `v1` and `v2` (1 and 2, respectively), the correct output based on the provided code should be `? 1 1 2 2`, not `? 0 0 1 1`.

Therefore, based on the code and the explicitly defined values of `v1` and `v2`, the output should be:

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
