Output: **n is greater than or equal to n, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if r is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise v1 is 0, v2 is n-1, i is n, prev is either i-1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or i-2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, stdin is empty, and the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r in the last iteration, and prev is either j if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or j-1 depending on whether r is '>' or not, for j ranging from 1 to n-1, and r is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either i-1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or i-2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, and v1 is either n-1 if r is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise v1 is 0**
