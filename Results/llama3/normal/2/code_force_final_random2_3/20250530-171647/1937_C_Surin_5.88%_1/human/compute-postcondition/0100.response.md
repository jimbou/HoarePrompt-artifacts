Output State: **n is an integer, kp is 2, g is 0, v1 is 0, v2 is n-1, i is n, prev is either i-1 or 0 or i-2 depending on the value of r in the last iteration, stdin is empty, and the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is 0 and prev is either j if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or j-1 depending on whether r is '>' or not, for j ranging from 1 to n-1, and r is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either i-1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or i-2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, and v1 is 0, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

In this final state, the value of `n` is now an integer, which was previously greater than or equal to `n`. The values of `kp`, `g`, and `v2` remain unchanged. The value of `v1` is now 0, which was previously either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r` in the last iteration. The value of `i` is now `n`, which was previously `n`. The value of `prev` is either `i-1` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not. The output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is 0 and `prev` is either `j` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `j-1` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, for `j` ranging from 1 to `n-1`. The output also includes the string "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either `i-1` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, and `v1` is 0. The output buffer has been flushed.
