Output State: **n is at least 3, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is 1 if r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0, v2 is 2, i is 2, prev is n-1 if r is '<', otherwise prev is either 0 or n-1, stdin contains 1 input: an empty string, and this is printed: "? 0 0 1 1"**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of n is at least 3, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is 1 if the relation r is '<', otherwise v1 is 0, v2 is now 2 (which is the current value of i), i is 2, prev is n-1 if r is '<', otherwise prev is either 0 or n-1. The stdin still contains 1 input: an empty string, and the string "? 0 0 1 1" is printed.
