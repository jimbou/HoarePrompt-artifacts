Output State: **`n` is an integer, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `prev` is 0, stdin is empty, and the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1` and `prev` is either `j` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `j-1` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, for `j` ranging from 1 to `n-1`, and `r` is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either `i-1` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, and `v1` is `n-1`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `prev` has been reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The output is still a series of strings in the specified format, and the output buffer has been flushed.
