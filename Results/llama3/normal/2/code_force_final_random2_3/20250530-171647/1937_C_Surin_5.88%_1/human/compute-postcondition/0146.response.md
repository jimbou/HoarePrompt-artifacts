Output: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, kp is 2, g is 0, v1 is n-1, v2 is n-1, i is n, stdin is empty, the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where v1 is either 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 and prev is either j if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or j-1 depending on whether r is '>' or not, for j ranging from 1 to n-1, and r is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either i-1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev is either 0 or i-2 depending on whether r is '>' or not, and v1 is n-1, and the output buffer has been flushed, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [1] [n-1] [0]", and r is a string containing the user's input. If r is '>', then prev is 1, otherwise prev remains 0, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [2] [n-1] [prev]" where prev is either 1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev remains 0, and r is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "? [n-1] [3] [n-1] [prev]" where prev is either 1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev remains 0, and r is a string containing the user's input, and the output buffer has been flushed, and r is a string containing the user's input. If r is not '>', then the program does not execute any additional operations, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where prev is either 1 if r is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise prev remains 0, and v1 is n-1**
