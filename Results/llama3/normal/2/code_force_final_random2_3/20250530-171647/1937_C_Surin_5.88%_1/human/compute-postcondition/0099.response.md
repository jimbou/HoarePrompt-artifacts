To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for kp in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `kp` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `kp` is 1, and `stdin` is empty. For the loop to execute again, `kp` needs to be incremented by 1, and `stdin` needs to have a new input value.

Since `kp` is incremented by 1, its new value will be 2.

The state of `stdin` is not explicitly mentioned, but since it is empty at the end of the previous iteration, it is assumed that a new input value will be provided for the next iteration.

The other variables mentioned in the state (`n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `i`, `prev`, `r`, and the output) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to n, `kp` is 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1` if `r` is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise `v1` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `prev` is either `i-1` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, stdin is not empty, and the output is a series of strings in the format "? [v1] [j] [v1] [prev]" where `v1` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `r` in the last iteration, and `prev` is either `j` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `j-1` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, for `j` ranging from 1 to `n-1`, and `r` is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: "! [prev] [v1]" where `prev` is either `i-1` if `r` is '>' in the last iteration, otherwise `prev` is either 0 or `i-2` depending on whether `r` is '>' or not, and `v1` is either `n-1` if `r` is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise `v1` is 0, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
