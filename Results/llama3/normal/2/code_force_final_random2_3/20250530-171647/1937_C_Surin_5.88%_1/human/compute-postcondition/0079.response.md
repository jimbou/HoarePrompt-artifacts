Output State: **n is greater than 1, kp is 1, g is 0, v1 is n-1 if r is '<' in the last iteration, otherwise v1 is 0, v2 is n-1, i is 1, prev is 0, stdin is empty, and the output is "? [v1] [1] [v1] [0]" where v1 is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of r in the last iteration, and r is a string containing the user's input**.

The first line, `sys.stdout.flush()`, ensures that any buffered output is immediately written to the standard output. This does not affect any variables but ensures that the printed message is displayed promptly.

The second line, `r = input()`, reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. Since stdin was empty before this line, it remains empty after this line. The value of `r` is now a string containing the user's input.
