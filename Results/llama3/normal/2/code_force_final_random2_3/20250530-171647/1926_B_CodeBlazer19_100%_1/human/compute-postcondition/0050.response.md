Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string that is the last test case, `stdin` contains `t-n-3` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains either 0 or more than 1 '1's, `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to the last test case from the input, and the number of test cases in `stdin` has been reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `a` and `b` are still dependent on the number of '1's in the new value of `s`.
