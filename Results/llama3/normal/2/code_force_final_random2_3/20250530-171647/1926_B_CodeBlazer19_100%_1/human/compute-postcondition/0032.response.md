The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is a string that is the last test case, stdin contains `t-n-1` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then the value of `a` which is not 0 is printed. If `s` contains more than one '1', then 'SQUARE' is printed. If `s` contains no '1', then an empty string is printed.**
