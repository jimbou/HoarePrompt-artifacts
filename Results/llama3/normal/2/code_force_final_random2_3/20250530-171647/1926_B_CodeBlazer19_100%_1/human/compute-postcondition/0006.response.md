Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 1, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is an empty string, `s` is a string containing exactly one '1', `j` is 0, and stdin contains `t-2` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'TRIANGLE', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases.
