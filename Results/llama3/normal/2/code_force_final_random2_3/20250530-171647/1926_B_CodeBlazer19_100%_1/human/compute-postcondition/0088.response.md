Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least `n`, `j` is `n`, `s` is a string containing the input from stdin, and stdin contains `t-n-1` test cases. The current value of `a` is not 0, and based on the test cases in `s`, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string if any test case contains exactly one '1', or `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE' if any test case contains more than one '1'.**
