Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is a string that is the last test case, stdin contains `t-n` test cases. `a` is 0, `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `b` is an empty string.***
