Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is a string that is the last test case, stdin contains `t-n` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then the value of `a` which is not 0 is printed. If `s` contains more than one '1', then 'SQUARE' is printed. If `s` contains no '1', then an empty string is printed.**
