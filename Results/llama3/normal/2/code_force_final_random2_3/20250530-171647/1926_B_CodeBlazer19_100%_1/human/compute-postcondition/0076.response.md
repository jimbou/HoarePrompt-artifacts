Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `j` is 1, `s` is a string containing either exactly one '1', more than one '1', or no '1', `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string, and stdin contains `t-n-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to the input string, which can contain either exactly one '1', more than one '1', or no '1'. The values of `a` and `b` are determined based on the contents of `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-n-3` test cases, since one test case has been consumed by the input operation.
