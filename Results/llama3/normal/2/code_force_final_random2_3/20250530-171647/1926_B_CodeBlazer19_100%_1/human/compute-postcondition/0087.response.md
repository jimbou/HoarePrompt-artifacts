Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least `n`, `j` is `n`, `s` is a string containing the input from stdin, and stdin contains `t-n-1` test cases. If any of the test cases `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string. If any of the test cases `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If none of the test cases `s` contains '1', then `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all `n` test cases. The value of `a` and `b` depends on the contents of the test cases. If any test case contains exactly one '1', then `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If any test case contains more than one '1', then `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. If none of the test cases contain '1', then `a` and `b` retain their initial values. The other variables `t`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
