Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is a string that is the last test case, stdin contains `t-n` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed `n` times, and the variables `j` and `s` have been updated accordingly. The value of `a` and `b` depends on the last test case `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string. The other variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
