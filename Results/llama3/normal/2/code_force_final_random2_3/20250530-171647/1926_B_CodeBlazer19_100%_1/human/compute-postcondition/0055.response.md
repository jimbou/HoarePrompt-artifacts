Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer and is at least n, j is n, s is a string that is the last test case, stdin contains t-n test cases. If s contains exactly one '1', a is 'TRIANGLE' and b is an empty string. If s contains either 0 or more than 1 '1's, a is 0 and b is 'SQUARE' if s contains more than 1 '1's, otherwise b is an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the variable `j` has reached the value of `n`. The variable `s` now holds the last test case, and the standard input (`stdin`) contains `t-n` test cases. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the last test case: if it contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string; if it contains either 0 or more than 1 '1's, `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE' if there are more than 1 '1's, otherwise `b` is an empty string. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
