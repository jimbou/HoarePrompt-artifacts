Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string that is the last test case, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is an empty string if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `b` is 'SQUARE', stdin contains `t-n-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'TRIANGLE'. The value of `b` depends on the number of '1's in the string `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `b` is an empty string. Otherwise, `b` is 'SQUARE'. The values of the other variables remain the same.
