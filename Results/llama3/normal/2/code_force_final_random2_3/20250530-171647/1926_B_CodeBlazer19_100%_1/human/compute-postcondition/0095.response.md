Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is equal to 0, i is t-1, n is an integer and is at least n, j is n, s is a string containing the input from stdin, and stdin contains 0 test cases. If a is not 0, then based on the test cases in s, either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 is printed as the value of a, and b is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string if any test case contains exactly one '1', or 'SQUARE' if any test case contains more than one '1'. If a is 0, then the value of b is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all iterations, and the loop variables have reached their final values. The value of `t` is now 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The value of `i` is `t-1`, which means it has reached the last iteration. The value of `n` is still an integer and is at least `n`, indicating that the last test case has been processed. The value of `j` is `n`, indicating that the last line of the last test case has been processed. The value of `s` is a string containing the input from stdin, which is now empty since all test cases have been processed. The value of `a` and `b` depend on the test cases in `s`, and their values are printed accordingly.
