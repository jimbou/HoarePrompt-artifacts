Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 100) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 1, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `s` is a string, `j` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is assigned the input string from the stdin, which contains `t-1` test cases. Since one test case is consumed by the input operation, the stdin now contains `t-2` test cases. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
