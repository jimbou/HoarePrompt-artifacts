The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string containing either exactly one '1', more than one '1', or no '1', and stdin contains `t-n-3` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string.**
