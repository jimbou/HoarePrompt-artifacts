Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a string that is the last test case and contains more than 1 '1's, `stdin` contains `t-n-3` test cases, `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` has been changed to 'SQUARE', while the values of all other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
