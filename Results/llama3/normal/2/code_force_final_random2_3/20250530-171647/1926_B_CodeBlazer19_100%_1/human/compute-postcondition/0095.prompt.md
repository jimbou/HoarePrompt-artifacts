Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 100), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing a string of `n` characters '0' or '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'TRIANGLE'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'SQUARE'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is a string that is the last test case, stdin contains `t-n` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then the value of `a` which is not 0 is printed. If `s` contains more than one '1', then 'SQUARE' is printed. If `s` contains no '1', then an empty string is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer and is at least n, j is n, s is a string that is the last test case, stdin contains t-n test cases. If s contains exactly one '1', 'TRIANGLE' is printed. If s contains either 0 or more than 1 '1's, 'SQUARE' is printed if s contains more than 1 '1's, otherwise an empty string is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least `n`, `j` is `n`, `s` is a string containing the input from stdin, and stdin contains `t-n-1` test cases. If `a` is not 0, then based on the test cases in `s`, either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 is printed as the value of `a`, and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string if any test case contains exactly one '1', or 'SQUARE' if any test case contains more than one '1'. If `a` is 0, then the value of `b` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
