Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer and is at least n, j is n, s is a string that is the last test case, stdin contains t-n-1 test cases, a is 0, b is an empty string**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is updated to be the integer value of the input, which is at least `n`. The value of `j` is still `n`, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `s` is still the last test case, as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1, as one test case is consumed by the `input()` function. The new variables `a` and `b` are introduced, with `a` being 0 and `b` being an empty string.
