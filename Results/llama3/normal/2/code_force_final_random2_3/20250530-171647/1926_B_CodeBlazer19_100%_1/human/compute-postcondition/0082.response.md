Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string containing the input from stdin, and stdin contains `t-n-4` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is updated to the input from stdin, and the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions on `a` and `b` based on the number of '1's in `s` also remain the same.
