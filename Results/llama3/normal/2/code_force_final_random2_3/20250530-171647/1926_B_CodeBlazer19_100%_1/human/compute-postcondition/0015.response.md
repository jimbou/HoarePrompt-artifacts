Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `j` is 1, `s` is a string, `a` is either 0 or 'TRIANGLE', `b` is 'SQUARE', stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE'. If `s` contains more than one '1' or no '1', then `a` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'SQUARE', regardless of the previous conditions. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `s` and `a` are still valid. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
