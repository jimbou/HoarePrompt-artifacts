Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a string that is the last test case and contains exactly one '1', `stdin` contains `t-n-3` test cases, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is an empty string**

The code assigns the string 'TRIANGLE' to variable `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
