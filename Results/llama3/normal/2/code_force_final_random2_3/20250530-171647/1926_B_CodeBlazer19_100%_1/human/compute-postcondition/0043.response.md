To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but we can refine the constraint on `n` to be at least 2, since `j` is now 1.

The other variables `t`, `i`, `s`, `stdin`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `j` is 1, `s` is a string that is the last test case, `stdin` contains `t-n-3` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains either 0 or more than 1 '1's, `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s` contains more than 1 '1's, otherwise `b` is an empty string.**
