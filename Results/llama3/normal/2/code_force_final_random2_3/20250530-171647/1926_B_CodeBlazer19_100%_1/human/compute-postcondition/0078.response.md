Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `j` is 1, `s` is a string containing either exactly one '1', more than one '1', or no '1', `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', and stdin contains `t-n-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'SQUARE', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-n-3` test cases.
