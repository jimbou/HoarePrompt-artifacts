To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 100) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, and `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to set `n` to be at least 1 and `j` to be 0 (since it's the starting value of the range).

State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 100) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 1, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `j` is 0**
