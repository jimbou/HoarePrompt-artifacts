The code prints the value of `b`, which is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string. The value of `b` depends on the contents of the string `s`, which is the last test case. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `b` is an empty string.

Output: **'SQUARE' if s contains more than one '1', otherwise an empty string**
