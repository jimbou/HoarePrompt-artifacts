Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string containing the input from stdin, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string if `s` contains no '1', and stdin contains `t-n-4` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `a` is now fixed to 'TRIANGLE', regardless of the previous conditions. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `s` and `b` are still valid, but now `a` is always 'TRIANGLE'.
