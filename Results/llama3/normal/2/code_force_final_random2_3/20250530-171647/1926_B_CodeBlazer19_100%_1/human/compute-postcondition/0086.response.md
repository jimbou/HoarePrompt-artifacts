Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string containing the input from stdin, and stdin contains `t-n-4` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string.**
