Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string containing the input from stdin, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', and stdin contains `t-n-4` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'SQUARE', regardless of the previous conditions. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions. The value of `a` is now either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, as the previous conditions that determined its value are no longer relevant due to the assignment of `b` to 'SQUARE'.
