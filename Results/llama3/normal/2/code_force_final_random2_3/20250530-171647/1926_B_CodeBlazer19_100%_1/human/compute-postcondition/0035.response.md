Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a string that is the last test case, `stdin` contains `t-n-3` test cases, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string**

The value of `s` is updated to be the last test case, which is the input from `stdin`. The `stdin` now contains `t-n-3` test cases, since one test case has been read and assigned to `s`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
