To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a string that is the last test case, `stdin` contains `t-n-2` test cases, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string**
