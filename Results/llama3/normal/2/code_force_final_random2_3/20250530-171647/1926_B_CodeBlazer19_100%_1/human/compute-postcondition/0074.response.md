Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 1, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-n-2` test cases. If the last test case `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the last test case `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If the last test case `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.***
