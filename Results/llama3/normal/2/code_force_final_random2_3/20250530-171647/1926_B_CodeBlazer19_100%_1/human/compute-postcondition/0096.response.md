Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes a series of test cases, and prints the shape type ('TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE') based on the input strings. It iterates through each test case, checks the number of '1's in each string, and determines the shape type accordingly. If a 'TRIANGLE' is found, it is printed; otherwise, if a 'SQUARE' is found, it is printed. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding shape types.**
