Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string that is the first test case, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to the first test case from the input, and the number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as in the initial state, but their relationships with `s` have been updated based on the new value of `s`.
