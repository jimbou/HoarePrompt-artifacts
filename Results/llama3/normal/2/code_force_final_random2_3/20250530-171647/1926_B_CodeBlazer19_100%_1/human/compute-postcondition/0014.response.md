Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `j` is 1, `s` is a string, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is an empty string, stdin contains `t-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'TRIANGLE', regardless of the original value of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
