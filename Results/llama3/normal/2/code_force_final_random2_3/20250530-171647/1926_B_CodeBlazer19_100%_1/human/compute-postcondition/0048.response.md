Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `j` is 1, `s` is a string that is the second last test case, `stdin` contains `t-n-2` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains either 0 or more than 1 '1's, `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'.**
