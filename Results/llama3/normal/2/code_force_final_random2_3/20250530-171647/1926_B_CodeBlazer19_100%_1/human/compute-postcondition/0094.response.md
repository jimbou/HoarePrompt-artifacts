Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least `n`, `j` is `n`, `s` is a string containing the input from stdin, and stdin contains `t-n-1` test cases. If `a` is not 0, then based on the test cases in `s`, either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 is printed as the value of `a`, and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string if any test case contains exactly one '1', or 'SQUARE' if any test case contains more than one '1'. If `a` is 0, then the value of `b` is printed.**
