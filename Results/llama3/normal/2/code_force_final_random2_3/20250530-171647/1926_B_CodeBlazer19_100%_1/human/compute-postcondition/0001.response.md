According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 100) and stdin contains `t` test cases. So for the loop to be executed  `t` must be greater than 0 and i is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 100), stdin contains `t` test cases, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
