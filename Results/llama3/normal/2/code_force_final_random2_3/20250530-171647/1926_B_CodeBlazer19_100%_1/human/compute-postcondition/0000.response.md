The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing a string of `n` characters '0' or '1'. After the code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input, and the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing a string of `n` characters '0' or '1'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 100), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing a string of `n` characters '0' or '1'.**
