Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string that is the first test case, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string.***
