Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 1, `a` is 0, `j` is 0, and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If `s` contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', then `b` is 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.***
