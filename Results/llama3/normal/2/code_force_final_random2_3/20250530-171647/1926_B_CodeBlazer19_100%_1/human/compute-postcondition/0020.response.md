Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string that is the first test case, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is an empty string if `s` contains no '1' or exactly one '1', or 'SQUARE' if `s` contains more than one '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'TRIANGLE', regardless of the previous conditions. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `s` and `b` are still valid.
