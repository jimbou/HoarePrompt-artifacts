Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer and is at least n, j is n, s is a string that is the last test case, stdin contains t-n-1 test cases, a is 0, b is an empty string
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    s = input()
    if s.count('1') == 1:
        a = 'TRIANGLE'
    elif s.count('1') > 1:
        b = 'SQUARE'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 1, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-n-2` test cases. If the last test case `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If the last test case `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If the last test case `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `j` is 1, `s` is a string containing either exactly one '1', more than one '1', or no '1', and stdin contains `t-n-3` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string containing the input from stdin, and stdin contains `t-n-4` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0 and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
