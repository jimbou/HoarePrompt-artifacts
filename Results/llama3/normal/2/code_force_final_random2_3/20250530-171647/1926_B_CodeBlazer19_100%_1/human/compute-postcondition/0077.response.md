Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `j` is 1, `s` is a string containing either exactly one '1', more than one '1', or no '1', `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string, and stdin contains `t-n-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'TRIANGLE', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains `t-n-3` test cases.
