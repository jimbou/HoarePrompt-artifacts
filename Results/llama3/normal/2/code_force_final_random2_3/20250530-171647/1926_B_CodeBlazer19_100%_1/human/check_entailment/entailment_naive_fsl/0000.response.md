Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. The issue lies in the way it checks for triangles and squares. 

For triangles, it checks if there is a row with only one '1', which is not a sufficient condition for a triangle. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each row.

For squares, it checks if there is a row with more than one '1', which is also not a sufficient condition for a square. A square can have any number of '1's in a row, as long as the number of '1's is the same in each row.

Here's a counterexample:

Input:

    3
    000
    011
    111

The program will output "TRIANGLE", but the correct output is "SQUARE".

To fix this, the program needs to check the number of '1's in each row and the position of the '1's in each row to correctly identify the shape.
