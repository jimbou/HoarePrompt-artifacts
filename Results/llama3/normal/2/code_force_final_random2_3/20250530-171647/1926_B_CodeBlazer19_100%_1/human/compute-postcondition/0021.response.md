Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string that is the first test case, stdin contains `t-4` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `s` remains the same as in the initial state. The value of `b` is now 'SQUARE' regardless of the number of '1's in `s`. The value of `a` depends on the number of '1's in `s`: if `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE'; if `s` contains more than one '1' or no '1', then `a` is 0. The number of test cases in stdin remains `t-4`.
