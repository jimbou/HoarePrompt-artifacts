The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string that is the second last test case, `stdin` contains `t-n-2` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains either 0 or more than 1 '1's, `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'.**
