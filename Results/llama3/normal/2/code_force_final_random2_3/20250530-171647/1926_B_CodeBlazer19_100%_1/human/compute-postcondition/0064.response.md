To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `t` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least n, `j` is n, `s` is a string that is the last test case, stdin contains t-n test cases. If s contains exactly one '1', 'TRIANGLE' is printed. If s contains either 0 or more than 1 '1's, 'SQUARE' is printed if s contains more than 1 '1's, otherwise an empty string is printed.**
