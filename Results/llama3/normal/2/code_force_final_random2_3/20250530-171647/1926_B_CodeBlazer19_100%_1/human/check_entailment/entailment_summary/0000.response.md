Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if a row has exactly one '1' to determine if it's a triangle, and if a row has more than one '1' to determine if it's a square. However, this logic is flawed. A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, and a square can have exactly one '1' in a row. The program does not correctly identify the shape based on the pattern of '1's in the grid.

Moreover, the program does not check the pattern of '1's across multiple rows, which is necessary to determine the shape. It only checks the number of '1's in each row individually.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and will produce incorrect results for many test cases.

Correctness: **False**
