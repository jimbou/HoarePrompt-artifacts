Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer and is at least n, j is n, s is a string that is the last test case, stdin contains t-n test cases. If s contains exactly one '1', 'TRIANGLE' is printed. If s contains either 0 or more than 1 '1's, 'SQUARE' is printed if s contains more than 1 '1's, otherwise an empty string is printed.**
