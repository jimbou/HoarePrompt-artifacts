Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 2, `j` is 1, `s` is a string, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be a string that was input from the user. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1, from `t-2` to `t-3`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are still dependent on the contents of `s`, but now `s` has a specific value.
