Output: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer and is at least n, j is n, s is a string that is the last test case, stdin contains t-n test cases. The current value of a is not 0, which means s contains exactly one '1', and the current value of a is 'TRIANGLE', and the current value of b is an empty string, and 'TRIANGLE' is being printed**
