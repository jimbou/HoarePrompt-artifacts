Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is at least 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a string that is the last test case and contains more than 1 '1', `stdin` contains `t-n-2` test cases, `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE'**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'SQUARE', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `t`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `stdin`, and `a` are still valid.
