To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1). Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `len(pans)`, which does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be 1 (the starting value of the range) and `n` to be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, `s` is a string, `pans` is a list containing at least `len(pans)` elements, `mak` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 inputs**
