The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, _ is 2, s is the input string, stdin is empty. If s is '<', then mak is 1, pans is [1], and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2, where mak2 is either 0, 1, or n-3. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value 1. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the state remains unchanged, with mak and mak2 being either 0, 1, or n-3, and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2.**
