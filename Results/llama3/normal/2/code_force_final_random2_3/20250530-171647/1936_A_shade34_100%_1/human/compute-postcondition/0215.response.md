To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(pans)):`. The objects involved are `i` and `pans`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `pans` is a list containing at least 3 values from 0 to `n-1`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `pans`. Since `i` is 2, the length of `pans` must be at least 3. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `pans` to have at least 4 values.

The state of `i` can be adjusted to be the next value in the range, which is 3.

The other variables (`n`, `_`, `s`, `mak`, `mak2`, and the output buffer) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `_` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing at least 4 values from 0 to `n-1`. If the input string `s` is '>', then `mak` is 2, otherwise `mak` is 0. The output buffer is empty, and the following string is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.**
