Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables as follows:

* `n` is greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified.
* `i` is equal to 1.
* `mak` is equal to 0.
* `_` is equal to 0, but it is not used in the print statement.
* `stdin` is empty, but it is not used in the print statement.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`

The print statement will output a string that starts with '?' followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.

Since `mak` is equal to 0, the output will be:

`? 0 0 1 1`

Therefore, the final output is:

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
