Based on the precondition, we know that `mak` is 2 when the input string is '>', and `i` is 3. We also know that `pans` is a list containing at least 4 elements.

The print statement is: `print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`

Since `mak` is 2, `pans[mak]` will be the third element of the `pans` list (because indexing starts at 0). Similarly, `pans[i]` will be the fourth element of the `pans` list.

Therefore, the print statement will output: '?' followed by the third element of the `pans` list, the third element of the `pans` list, the fourth element of the `pans` list, and the fourth element of the `pans` list.

Output: **? [third element of pans] [third element of pans] [fourth element of pans] [fourth element of pans]**
