Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `_` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1`, `mak` is 0, and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, where `mak2` is either 0, 1, or `n-2`.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the string '?' and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, where `mak2` can be either 0, 1, or `n-2`. The stdin is still empty.
