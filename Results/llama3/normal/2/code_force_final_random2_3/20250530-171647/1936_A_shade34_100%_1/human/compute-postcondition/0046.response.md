Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is one more than its previous value plus one, n is greater than the new value of i, s is a string containing the input value, mak is equal to the new value of i, pans is a list containing the new value of i, and the output is '?' , the value of mak, the value of mak2, the new value of i, and the value of mak2 if s is neither '<' nor '='.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `mak`, effectively making `mak` equal to the new value of `i`. The second line creates a list `pans` containing the new value of `i`. 

Since the code does not modify the values of `n`, `s`, or the output, these variables retain their initial values. The value of `i` is also not modified by the code, so it remains one more than its previous value plus one. The value of `mak2` is not affected by the code, so it remains the same as its initial value. 

The only changes made by the code are the assignment of the new value of `i` to `mak` and the creation of the list `pans` containing the new value of `i`. Therefore, the final output state includes the updated values of `mak` and `pans`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
