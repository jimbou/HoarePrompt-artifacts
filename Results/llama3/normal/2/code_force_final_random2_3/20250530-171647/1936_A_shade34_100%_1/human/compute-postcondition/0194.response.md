Output: **n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, _ is 2, s is the input string, stdin is empty. If s is '<', then mak is 1, pans is [1], and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2, where mak2 is either 0, 1, or n-3. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value 1. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the state remains unchanged, with mak and mak2 being either 0, 1, or n-3, and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2. The output buffer now contains the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2, where mak is either 0, 1, or n-3, mak2 is either 0, 1, or n-3, and i is 2.**
