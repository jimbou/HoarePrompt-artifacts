Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is i + 2, _ is 1, s is a string containing the input value, mak is i + 2, mak2 is 0, pans is a list containing the value of i + 2, the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, i + 1, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and the flushed output, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of mak, mak2 which is 0, i + 1 which is i + 2, and mak2 which is 0, and the input buffer is empty, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of mak, mak2 which is 0, i + 1 which is i + 2, and mak2 which is 0.**

The code modifies the values of `mak` and `pans`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `mak`, which is `i + 2`. The second line assigns a new list containing the value of `i` to `pans`, which is `i + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
