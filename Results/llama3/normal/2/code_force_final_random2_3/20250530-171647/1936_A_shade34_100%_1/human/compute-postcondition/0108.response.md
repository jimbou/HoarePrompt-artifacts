Postcondition: **n is greater than 0, i is less than n, _ is 1, s is a string. If s is '<', then mak is equal to i, mak2 is equal to mak, and pans is a list containing the value of i. If s is '=', then mak is 0, mak2 is 0, and pans is a list containing the value of i. If s is not '<' or '=', then mak is 0, mak2 is 0, and pans is an empty list. The output buffer contains the printed values of 0, i, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i, and the value of mak2. The output buffer also contains the flushed output.**
