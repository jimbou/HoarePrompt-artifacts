The code prints a string '?' followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`. 

`mak` is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` is 2. Since the precondition does not specify the input string, we cannot determine the exact value of `mak`. However, we can describe its value based on the condition.

`i` is equal to 3.

Output: **? [0 or 2] [0 or 2] 3 3 (where [0 or 2] is the value of mak which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise 2)**
