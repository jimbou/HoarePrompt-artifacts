Output: **n is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, _ is 2. If s is '<', then s is '<', pans contains a single element 0, mak is n-2, and the string '?' and the values of mak and i are printed. Otherwise, s is not '<', and if s is '=', then pans contains 0, otherwise pans is an empty list. In both cases, mak is either 0 or 1 depending on the input, and the string '?' and the values of mak and i are printed. The output buffer is flushed, and the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2 are printed, where mak and mak2 are either 0, 1, or n-3 and i is 1, and the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2 are printed, where mak and mak2 are either 0, 1, or n-3 and i is 1**
