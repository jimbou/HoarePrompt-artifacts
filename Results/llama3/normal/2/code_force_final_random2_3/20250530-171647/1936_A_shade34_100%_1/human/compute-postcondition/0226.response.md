Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a permutation of integers. For each test case, it identifies the largest element and its position in the permutation, and prints this information to the console. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases, ensuring that the output buffer is empty after completion.**
