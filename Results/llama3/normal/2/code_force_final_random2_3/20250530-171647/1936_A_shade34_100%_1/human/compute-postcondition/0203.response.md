Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 0, this will print the first element of the `pans` list, which is a value between 0 and `n-1`.
* `pans[mak]`: This is the same as the previous one, so it will print the same value.
* `pans[i]`: Since `i` is 1, this will print the second element of the `pans` list, which is a value between 0 and `n-1`.
* `pans[i]`: This is the same as the previous one, so it will print the same value.

So, the print statement will output a string that contains the character '?' followed by the first element of the `pans` list (twice), and the second element of the `pans` list (twice).

Output: **? [first element of pans] [first element of pans] [second element of pans] [second element of pans]**
