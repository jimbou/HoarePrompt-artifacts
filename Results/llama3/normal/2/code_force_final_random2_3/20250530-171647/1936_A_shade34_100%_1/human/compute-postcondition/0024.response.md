Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `mak` is a variable with a value that is not explicitly specified in the precondition. However, since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, we can infer that `mak` has a value that is being used in the print statement.
* `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so it will print the same value as `mak`.
* `i` is less than `n`, but the exact value of `i` is not specified. Since `n` is greater than 0, we can infer that `i` is a non-negative integer less than `n`.
* The output buffer contains the printed values of `mak`, `i`, and the conditional print statements, but this information is not relevant to the current print statement.

Therefore, the print statement will output the values of `mak`, `mak2` (which is equal to `mak`), `i`, and `mak2` again.

Output: **?, [mak], [mak], [i], [mak] (where [mak] is the value of mak, and [i] is the value of i, which is a non-negative integer less than n)**
