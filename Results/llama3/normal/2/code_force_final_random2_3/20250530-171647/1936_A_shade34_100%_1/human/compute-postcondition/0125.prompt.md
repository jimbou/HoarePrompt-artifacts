Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the input value, i is equal to n, _ is 1, mak is equal to n-1 if the input string is '<', otherwise mak is 0, mak2 is equal to mak, pans is an empty list, and the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, i, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '!', 0, and the value at index mak of the list pans which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise the value at index mak of the list pans which is 0, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' , 0, 0, 1, 1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' , mak which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise mak which is n-1, mak which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise mak which is n-1, i which is n, and i which is n, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' , mak which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise mak which is n-1, mak which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise mak which is n-1, i which is n, and i which is n, and the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer is flushed again. If the input string is '<', then mak is equal to n, and the output buffer contains the printed values of mak which is n, mak which is n, i which is n, and i which is n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is greater than 0, i is less than n, _ is 1, s is a string. If s is '<', then mak is equal to i, mak2 is equal to mak, and pans is a list containing the value of i. If s is '=', then mak is 0, mak2 is 0, and pans is a list containing the value of i. If s is not '<' or '=', then mak is 0, mak2 is 0, and pans is an empty list. The output buffer contains the printed values of 0, i, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i, and the value of mak2. The output buffer also contains the flushed output.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is greater than 0, i is i + 1, _ is 1, s is a string, if s is '<', then mak is i + 1, mak2 is 0, pans is a list containing the value of i + 1, otherwise, mak is 0, mak2 is 0, and pans is a list containing the value of i (if s is '<' or '='), and if s is '=', then pans has an additional element which is the current value of i. The output buffer contains the printed values of 0, i, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and the flushed output, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of mak, mak2 which is 0, i which is i + 1, and mak2 which is 0, and the input buffer is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is greater than 1, i is i + 2, _ is 1, s is a string containing the input value. If s is '<', then mak is i + 2, mak2 is 0, and pans is a list containing the value of i + 2. If s is not '<', then mak is 0, mak2 is 0, and if s is '=', then pans is a list containing the values of i + 1 and i + 2, otherwise pans is a list containing the value of i + 1. The output buffer contains the printed values of 0, i + 1, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and the flushed output, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of mak, mak2 which is 0, i + 1 which is i + 2, and mak2 which is 0, and the input buffer is empty, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of mak, mak2 which is 0, i + 1 which is i + 2, and mak2 which is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
