Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects that will be printed.

The print statement is: `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`

Here's a breakdown of the values:

* `?`: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `mak`: The initial state specifies that `mak` is 0, so this will print 0.
* `mak2`: Similarly, `mak2` is also 0, so this will print 0.
* `i`: The initial state specifies that `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has been incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `i` is not specified, so we can't determine the exact value of `i`. We can only say that `i` is some value greater than its initial value.
* `mak2`: Again, `mak2` is 0, so this will print 0.

Putting it all together, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 0 [i] 0 (where [i] is some value greater than its initial value)**
