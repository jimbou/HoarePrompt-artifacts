Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `len(pans)`, `_` is 0, `mak` is `len(pans)-1` if the input string `s` is '>', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<', the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '!', 0, and the value at index `mak` of the list `pans` which is `len(pans)-1` if the input string `s` is '>', otherwise 0**
