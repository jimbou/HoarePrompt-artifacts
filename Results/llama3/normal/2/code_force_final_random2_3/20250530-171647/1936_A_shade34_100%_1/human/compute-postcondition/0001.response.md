The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, and then initializes `mak` to 0. Since stdin initially contains one input, which is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be at least 1, after reading this integer, stdin becomes empty. The value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, mak is 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty**
