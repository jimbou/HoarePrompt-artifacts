Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `_` is 0, stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed. If the current value of the input is '<', then `mak` is 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0., and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i], and the output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer contains the strings "? 0 0 1 1" and "? [mak] [mak] [i] [i]". After flushing the buffer, these strings are printed to the output stream. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `_`, and `mak` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The stdin remains empty, as no input is read or modified.
