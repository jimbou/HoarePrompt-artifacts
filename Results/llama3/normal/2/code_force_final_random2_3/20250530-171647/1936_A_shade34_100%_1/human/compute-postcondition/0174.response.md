The code prints a string containing a '?' followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again. The value of `mak` is either `n-1` (if the input is '<'), 0, or 1 (depending on the input). The value of `mak2` is equal to `mak`. The value of `i` is 0.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 0 [mak] (where [mak] is either 0, 1, or n-1)**
