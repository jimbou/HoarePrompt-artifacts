Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `_` is 0, `mak` is 2, stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed. If the current value of the input is '<', then this is printed: ? [2] [2] [2] [2], and the output buffer is flushed. Otherwise, this is printed: ? [2] [2] [2] [2], and the output buffer is flushed.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer is flushed, and the printed messages are updated accordingly.
