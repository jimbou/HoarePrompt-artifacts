Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first finds the index `mak` of the maximum element in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum element using the `?` query. This is done in `n-1` queries.

2. Then, it finds all elements that are equal to the maximum element by comparing each element with the maximum element using the `?` query. This is done in `n` queries.

3. Finally, it finds the index `mak` of the maximum element among the elements that are equal to the maximum element by comparing each element with the current maximum element using the `?` query. This is done in `len(pans)-1` queries.

4. The program then prints the indices of the maximum element and the maximum element among the elements that are equal to the maximum element.

The total number of queries is `n-1 + n + len(pans)-1`, which is less than or equal to `3n` because `len(pans)` is at most `n`.

Therefore, the program correctly finds the indices of the maximum element and the maximum element among the elements that are equal to the maximum element, and it does so within the allowed number of queries.

Correctness: **True**
