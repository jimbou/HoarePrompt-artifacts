Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects as follows:

* `mak` is either `i + 2` or `0`, depending on the value of `s`. Since `s` is not specified, we can't determine the exact value of `mak`. However, we can describe it as "either `i + 2` or `0`, depending on the value of `s`".
* `mak2` is always `0`.
* `i` is the current value of `i`, which is `i + 2` since `i` is incremented by `2` in the loop.
* `mak2` is again `0`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`

The print statement will output the following:

* `?` (a literal string)
* The value of `mak`, which is either `i + 2` or `0`, depending on the value of `s`.
* The value of `mak2`, which is always `0`.
* The current value of `i`, which is `i + 2`.
* The value of `mak2` again, which is always `0`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? [either i + 2 or 0, depending on the value of s], 0, i + 2, 0**

Note that we can't provide an exact numerical value for `mak` since it depends on the value of `s`, which is not specified. However, we can describe its possible values based on the initial state.
