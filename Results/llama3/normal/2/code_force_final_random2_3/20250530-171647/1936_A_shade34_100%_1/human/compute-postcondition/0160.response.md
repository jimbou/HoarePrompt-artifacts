The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak`, the value of `mak` again, the value of `i`, and the value of `i` again.

Since `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on the input, and `i` is 2, the output will be one of two possibilities:

- If the input is '<', then `mak` is 1, and the output will be: ?, 1, 1, 2, 2.
- If the input is not '<', then `mak` remains 0, and the output will be: ?, 0, 0, 2, 2.

Output: **?, 0, 0, 2, 2 or ?, 1, 1, 2, 2 (depending on the input)**
