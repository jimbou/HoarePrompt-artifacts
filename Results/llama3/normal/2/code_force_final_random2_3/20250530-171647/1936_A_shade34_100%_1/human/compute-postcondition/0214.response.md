Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing at least 3 values from 0 to `n-1`. If the input string `s` is '>', then `mak` is 2, otherwise `mak` is 0. The output buffer is empty, and the following string is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.***
