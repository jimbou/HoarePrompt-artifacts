Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `_` is 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing `i`, stdin contains 1 input: a string, the output buffer contains the printed values of `mak`, `i`, and the conditional print statements, and this is printed: "? mak mak2 i mak2", followed by the flushed output. The input string s is '='**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, and `i` is still less than `n`. The variable `_` remains 0. The value of `mak2` is still equal to `mak`. The list `pans` now contains the value of `i`. The input string `s` is still '='. The output buffer still contains the printed values of `mak`, `i`, and the conditional print statements, followed by the flushed output.
