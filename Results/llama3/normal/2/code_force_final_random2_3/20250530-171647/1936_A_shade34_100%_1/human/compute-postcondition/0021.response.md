Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 1, i is n, _ is 0, stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed. If the current value of the input is '<', then mak is n-1, and this is printed: ? [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] [n-1], and the output buffer is flushed. Otherwise, mak remains 0, and this is printed: ? [0] [0] [n-1] [n-1], and the output buffer is flushed. The value of mak and i are printed as: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now equal to `n`. The value of `mak` is either `n-1` if the input was '<' during the last iteration, or it remains 0 if the input was not '<' during any iteration. The output buffer has been flushed, and the last printed values are either `? [n-1] [n-1] [n-1] [n-1]` if `mak` is `n-1`, or `? [0] [0] [n-1] [n-1]` if `mak` is 0. The other variables `_` and `stdin` remain unchanged.
