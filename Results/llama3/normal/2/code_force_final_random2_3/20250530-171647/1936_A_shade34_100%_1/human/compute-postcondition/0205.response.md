Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 values from 0 to `n-1`, `mak` is 0, the output buffer is empty, and the following string is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, where `mak2` is either 0, 1, or `n-2`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the output buffer is now empty because `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called, which flushes the output buffer. The string '?' followed by the first and second elements of the list `pans` and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` has been printed.
