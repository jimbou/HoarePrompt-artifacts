To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how the variables within it are updated.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. This means the only variables we can adjust are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since it's a `range` loop), and `n` remains unchanged because it's the upper limit of the range.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so it's now one more than its previous value.
- `n` remains greater than 0 and must be greater than the new value of `i` for the loop to execute again.

Considering the other variables mentioned in the state (`_`, `stdin`, `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, and the output buffer), their states are not directly affected by the loop head. They are influenced by the loop body, which is not provided. Therefore, we cannot adjust their states based solely on the loop head.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is one more than its previous value, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
