Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects that are printed.

The code prints a string '?' followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.

The value of `mak` depends on the current value of the input. If the current value of the input is '<', then `mak` is 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

Since the precondition does not specify the current value of the input, we cannot determine the exact value of `mak`. However, we can describe its value based on the given information.

The value of `i` is given as 3.

Therefore, the output will be a string '?' followed by the value of `mak` (which is either 0 or 2), the value of `mak` again (which is either 0 or 2), the value of `i` (which is 3), and the value of `i` again (which is 3).

Output: **? [0 or 2] [0 or 2] 3 3**
