Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases). Each test case consists of one integer (the size of the permutation) and a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1, where n is the size of the permutation.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `len(pans)`, `_` is 0, `mak` is `len(pans)-1` if the input string `s` is '>', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<', the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '!', 0, and the value at index `mak` of the list `pans` which is `len(pans)-1` if the input string `s` is '>', otherwise 0, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `len(pans)`, `_` is 1, `s` is a string, `pans` is a list containing at least `len(pans)` elements. If the input string is '>', then `mak` is equal to `len(pans)-1` and the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of 0, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, and the following is printed: '?' followed by the values of the first element of the `pans` list, the first element of the `pans` list, the second element of the `pans` list, and the second element of the `pans` list, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of the first element of the `pans` list if `mak` is 1, otherwise the first element of the `pans` list if `mak` is 0, the first element of the `pans` list if `mak` is 1, otherwise the first element of the `pans` list if `mak` is 0, the second element of the `pans` list, and the second element of the `pans` list, and the output buffer is flushed again, and so on for all iterations of the loop. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and '!' followed by the value of `mak2` and the value of the element of the `pans` list at index `mak` is printed. The output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `_` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is either 0, 1, or `n-2`, the output buffer is empty, and the string '?' followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, and '!' followed by the value of `mak2` and the value of `pans[mak]` (which is the value at index `n-1` in the list `pans`) has been printed to the console.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
