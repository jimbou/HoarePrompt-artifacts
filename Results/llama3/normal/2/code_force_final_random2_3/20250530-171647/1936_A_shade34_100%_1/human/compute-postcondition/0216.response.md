The code prints a string that starts with '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0) repeated twice, then the third element of the list `pans` (at index 2) repeated twice, and finally the value of `mak` repeated twice, and the value of `i`.

Since `mak` is 2 if the input string `s` is '>', otherwise it is 0, and `i` is 3, the output will be '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0) repeated twice, then the third element of the list `pans` (at index 2) repeated twice, and finally the value of `mak` repeated twice, and the value of `i`.

Output: **? [first element of pans] [first element of pans] [third element of pans] [third element of pans] [mak] [mak] [i]**
