The code prints a string containing a question mark followed by the values of `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `pans[i]`, and `pans[i]`.

Here, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<'. The value of `mak` is 0, and the value of `i` is 1.

So, `pans[mak]` is the first element of the `pans` list, and `pans[i]` is the second element of the `pans` list.

Output: **? [first element of pans] [first element of pans] [second element of pans] [second element of pans]**
