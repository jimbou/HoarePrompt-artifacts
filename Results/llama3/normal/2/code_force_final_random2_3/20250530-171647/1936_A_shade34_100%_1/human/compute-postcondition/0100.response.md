Output: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `_` is 1, `mak` is equal to `n-1` if the input string is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list, and the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i`, and the value of `mak2`**
