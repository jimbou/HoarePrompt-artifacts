Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `_` is 0, stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed. If the current value of the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, and this is printed: ? [2] [2] [2] [2], and the output buffer is flushed. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, and this is printed: ? [0] [0] [2] [2], and the output buffer is flushed. The value of `mak` and `i` are printed as: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i]**.

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables, but it ensures that the output buffer is flushed, meaning that any pending output is immediately printed to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is now empty.
