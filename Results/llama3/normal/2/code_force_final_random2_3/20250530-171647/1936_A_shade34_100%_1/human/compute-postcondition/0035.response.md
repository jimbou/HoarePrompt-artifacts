Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
* `i` is one more than its previous value, but its previous value is not specified. However, we know that `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, which means `i` is less than `n`.
* `mak` and `mak2` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their values.

Given this information, the print statement will output the following:

* `?` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `mak` and `mak2` will be printed with their unknown values, which we can describe as "the values of `mak` and `mak2` respectively".
* `i` will be printed with its value, which is one more than its previous value, but less than `n`. We can describe this as "the current value of `i`, which is one more than its previous value and less than `n`".

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **?, the value of mak, the value of mak2, the current value of i (which is one more than its previous value and less than n), the value of mak2**
