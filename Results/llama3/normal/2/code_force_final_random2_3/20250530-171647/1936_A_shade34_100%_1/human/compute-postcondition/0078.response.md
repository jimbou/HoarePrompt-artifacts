Based on the precondition, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`

Here's what we know about the variables:

* `mak` is 0
* `i` is 1

So, when the print statement is executed, it will print:

* '?' (a literal string)
* `mak` (which is 0)
* `mak` again (which is still 0)
* `i` (which is 1)
* `i` again (which is still 1)

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
