To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the variables and objects involved based on the given initial state:

1. `n` is greater than or equal to 0: This information doesn't directly affect the print statement but indicates a condition on `n`.

2. `i` is equal to `len(pans)`: This means `i` holds the length of the list `pans`.

3. `_` is 0: This variable is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.

4. `mak` is `len(pans)-1` if the input string `s` is '>', otherwise `mak` is 0: This variable's value depends on the input string `s`. If `s` is '>', `mak` will be the last index of the list `pans`; otherwise, it will be 0.

5. `mak2` is 0: This variable is directly printed and is known to be 0.

6. `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<': The specific elements of `pans` are not provided, but we know it's a list of indices based on certain conditions.

Given the print statement `print('!', mak2, pans[mak])`:

- `'!'` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- `mak2` is 0, so it will print 0.
- `pans[mak]`: The value of `mak` determines which element of `pans` is printed. If `s` is '>', `mak` is the last index of `pans`, so the last element of `pans` will be printed. If `s` is not '>', `mak` is 0, so the first element of `pans` will be printed.

Since the exact elements of `pans` and the value of `s` are not specified, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `pans[mak]`. However, we can describe it based on the conditions given.

Output: **! 0 [the element of pans at index mak, which is the last element if s is '>' or the first element if s is not '>']**
