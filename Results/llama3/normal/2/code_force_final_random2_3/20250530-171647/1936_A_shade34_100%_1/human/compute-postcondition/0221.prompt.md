Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `_` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1`, `mak` is 0, and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, where `mak2` is either 0, 1, or `n-2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 values from 0 to `n-1`, the output buffer is empty, and the following string is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, where `mak2` is either 0, 1, or `n-2`. If the input string `s` is '>', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing at least 3 values from 0 to `n-1`. If the input string `s` is '>', then `mak` is 2, otherwise `mak` is 0. The output buffer is empty, and the following string is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `_` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing at least 4 values from 0 to `n-1`. If the input string `s` is '>', then `mak` is 3, otherwise `mak` is 3. The output buffer is empty, and the following string is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`. The output buffer is flushed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
