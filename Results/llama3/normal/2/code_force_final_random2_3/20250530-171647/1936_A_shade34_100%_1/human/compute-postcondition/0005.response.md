Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty, and the printed output remains the same. The only change is that the output buffer is flushed, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output device.
