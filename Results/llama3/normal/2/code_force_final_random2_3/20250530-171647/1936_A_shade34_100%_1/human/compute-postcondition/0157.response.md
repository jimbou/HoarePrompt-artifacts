Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, `s` is a string, `pans` is a list containing at least `len(pans)` elements, `mak` is 1, `stdin` contains 1 input, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed. The current value of `stdin` is '<'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mak` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The output buffer is still flushed, and the current value of `stdin` is still '<'.
