State: **n is greater than 1, i is i + 2, _ is 1, s is a string, if s is '<', then mak is i + 2, mak2 is 0, pans is a list containing the value of i + 2, otherwise, mak is 0, mak2 is 0, and pans is a list containing the value of i + 1 (if s is '<' or '='), and if s is '=', then pans has an additional element which is the current value of i + 1. The output buffer contains the printed values of 0, i + 1, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and the flushed output, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of mak, mak2 which is 0, i + 1 which is i + 2, and mak2 which is 0, and the input buffer is empty.**
