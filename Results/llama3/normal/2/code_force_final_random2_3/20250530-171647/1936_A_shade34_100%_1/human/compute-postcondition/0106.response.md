Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `_` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`, and the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak`, the value of `mak2`, the value of `i`, and the value of `mak2`, `s` is a string equal to '=', and the output buffer also contains the flushed output.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `pans` now contains the value of `i`, which was previously an empty list. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
