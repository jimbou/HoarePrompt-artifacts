The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the range of the input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of the input. If the range of the input is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the range of the input is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the range of the input must be greater than 1 and `_` is 2.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `len(pans)`, `_` is 2, `s` is a string, `pans` is a list containing at least `len(pans)` elements**
