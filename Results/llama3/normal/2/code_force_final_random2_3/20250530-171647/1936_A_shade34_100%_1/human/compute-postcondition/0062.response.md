Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `_` is 0, `mak` is 1 if the input string `s` is '>', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing at least 3 values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<', and the output buffer contains the updated printed values reflecting the changes in `i` and `pans`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the 1st or 2nd element of the list `pans` (depending on whether `s` is '>' or not), the same element again, the 3rd element of the list `pans` (which is the current value of `i`), and the same element again, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, and the output buffer still contains the same printed values. The only change is that the output buffer is flushed, meaning that any buffered output is written to the underlying file or device.
