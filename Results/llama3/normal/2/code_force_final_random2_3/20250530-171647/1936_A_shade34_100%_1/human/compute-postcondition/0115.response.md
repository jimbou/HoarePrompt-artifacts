Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is i + 1, _ is 1, s is a string, mak is 0, mak2 is 0, pans is a list containing the value of i (if s is '<' or '='), the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, i, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and the flushed output, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of mak which is 0, mak2 which is 0, i which is i + 1, and mak2 which is 0, and the input buffer is empty. If s is '=', then pans has an additional element which is the current value of i.***
