Postcondition: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a string, `pans` is a list containing at least `len(pans)` elements, `stdin` contains 0 input, the output buffer is flushed, and the string '?' and the values of `mak` and `i` are printed. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, otherwise, `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on the input.**
