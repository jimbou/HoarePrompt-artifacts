The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases). So for the loop to be executed the input must be at least 1 and `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases) that must be at least 1, `_` is 0**
