Postcondition: **n is greater than 0, i is i + 1, _ is 1, s is a string, if s is '<', then mak is i + 1, mak2 is 0, pans is a list containing the value of i + 1, otherwise, mak is 0, mak2 is 0, and pans is a list containing the value of i (if s is '<' or '='), and if s is '=', then pans has an additional element which is the current value of i. The output buffer contains the printed values of 0, i, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and the flushed output, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of mak, mak2 which is 0, i which is i + 1, and mak2 which is 0, and the input buffer is empty.**
