Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer that must be at least n, i is n, _ is 2, s is a string, pans is an empty list, stdin contains 0 input, the output buffer is flushed, and the string '?' and the values of mak and i are printed. If the input is '<', then mak is n-1. Otherwise, mak is either 0 or 1 depending on the input, and this is printed: '?' [mak] [mak] [i] [i] where [mak] is either 0, 1, or n-2 and [i] is n-1, and the output buffer is flushed, mak2 is equal to mak.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, _ is 2. If s is '<', then s is '<', pans contains a single element 0, mak is n-1, and the string '?' and the values of mak and i are printed. Otherwise, s is not '<', and if s is '=', then pans contains 0, otherwise pans is an empty list. In both cases, mak is either 0 or 1 depending on the input, and the string '?' and the values of mak and i are printed. The output buffer is flushed, and the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2 are printed, where mak and mak2 are either 0, 1, or n-2 and i is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, _ is 2, s is the input string, stdin is empty. If s is '<', then mak is 1, pans is [1], and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2, where mak2 is either 0, 1, or n-3. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value 1. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the state remains unchanged, with mak and mak2 being either 0, 1, or n-3, and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, _ is 2, s is the input string, stdin is empty. If s is '<', then mak is either 1 or 2, pans is either [1] or [2], and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2, where mak2 is either 0, 1, or n-3. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing either the value 1 or the values 1 and 2. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the state remains unchanged, with mak and mak2 being either 0, 1, or n-3, and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2, where mak is either 0, 1, or n-3, mak2 is either 0, 1, or n-3, and i is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
