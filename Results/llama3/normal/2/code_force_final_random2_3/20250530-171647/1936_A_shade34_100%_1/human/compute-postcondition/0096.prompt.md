Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the input value, i is equal to len(pans), _ is 1, mak is 0, mak2 is 0, pans is a list containing all the values of i for which the input string s was '=' or '<', the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, i, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '!', 0, and the value at index mak of the list pans which is 0, and the output buffer is flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '<':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `i` is equal to len(pans), `_` is 1, `mak` is equal to len(pans) if the input string is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<', the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '!', 0, and the value at index `mak` of the list `pans` which is 0, and the output buffer is flushed, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and this is printed: '?' , 0, 0, 1, 1, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `i` is equal to 2, `_` is 1, `mak` is equal to 2 if the input string is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<', the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '!', 0, and the value at index `mak` of the list `pans` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise the value at index `mak` of the list `pans` which is 0, and the output buffer is flushed, `n` must be greater than 2, and this is printed: '?' , 0, 0, 1, 1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' , `mak` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` which is 2, `mak` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` which is 2, `i` which is 2, and `i` which is 2, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `i` is equal to 3, `_` is 1, `mak` is equal to 2 if the input string is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<', the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '!', 0, and the value at index `mak` of the list `pans` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise the value at index `mak` of the list `pans` which is 0, and the output buffer is flushed, `n` must be greater than 3, and this is printed: '?' , 0, 0, 1, 1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' , `mak` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` which is 2, `mak` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` which is 2, `i` which is 3, and `i` which is 3, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' , `mak` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` which is 2, `mak` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` which is 2, `i` which is 3, and `i` which is 3, and the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer is flushed again. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is equal to 3, and the output buffer contains the printed values of `mak` which is 3, `mak` which is 3, `i` which is 3, and `i` which is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
