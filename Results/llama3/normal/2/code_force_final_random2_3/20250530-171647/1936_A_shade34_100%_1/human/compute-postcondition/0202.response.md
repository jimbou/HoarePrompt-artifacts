To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `pans`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `pans` has at least 2 elements (since the range starts from 1). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `pans` to have at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 values from 0 to `n-1`, `mak` is 0, and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, where `mak2` is either 0, 1, or `n-2`.**
