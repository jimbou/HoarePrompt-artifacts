Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is less than n, _ is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a string. If the input string s is '<', then mak is equal to i, mak2 is equal to i, pans is a list containing i, and the output buffer contains the printed values of i, i, and the conditional print statements, and this is printed: "? i i i i", followed by the flushed output. If the input string s is '=', then mak2 is equal to mak, pans is a list containing i, and the output buffer contains the printed values of mak, i, and the conditional print statements, and this is printed: "? mak mak2 i mak2", followed by the flushed output. If the input string s is neither '<' nor '=', then mak2 is equal to mak, pans is an empty list, and the output buffer contains the printed values of mak, i, and the conditional print statements, and this is printed: "? mak mak2 i mak2", followed by the flushed output.***
