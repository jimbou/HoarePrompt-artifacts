Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `len(pans)`, `_` is 1, `s` is a string, `pans` is a list containing at least `len(pans)` elements. If the input string is '>', then `mak` is equal to `len(pans)-1` and the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of 0, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, and the following is printed: '?' followed by the values of the first element of the `pans` list, the first element of the `pans` list, the second element of the `pans` list, and the second element of the `pans` list, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of the first element of the `pans` list if `mak` is 1, otherwise the first element of the `pans` list if `mak` is 0, the first element of the `pans` list if `mak` is 1, otherwise the first element of the `pans` list if `mak` is 0, the second element of the `pans` list, and the second element of the `pans` list, and the output buffer is flushed again, and so on for all iterations of the loop. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and '!' followed by the value of `mak2` and the value of the element of the `pans` list at index `mak` is printed.**
