Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<', and the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '?' followed by the first two elements of the list `pans` (pans[0] and pans[0]) and the current value of `i` (1) repeated twice (pans[1] and pans[1]), and the output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. This does not change the values of any variables, but it does affect the state of the output buffer. The output buffer now contains the same values as before, but they are no longer buffered and have been written to the output stream.
