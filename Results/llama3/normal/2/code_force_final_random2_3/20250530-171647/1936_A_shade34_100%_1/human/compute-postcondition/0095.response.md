Postcondition: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `i` is equal to 3, `_` is 1, `mak` is equal to 2 if the input string is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<', the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '!', 0, and the value at index `mak` of the list `pans` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise the value at index `mak` of the list `pans` which is 0, and the output buffer is flushed, `n` must be greater than 3, and this is printed: '?' , 0, 0, 1, 1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' , `mak` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` which is 2, `mak` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` which is 2, `i` which is 3, and `i` which is 3, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' , `mak` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` which is 2, `mak` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` which is 2, `i` which is 3, and `i` which is 3, and the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer is flushed again. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is equal to 3, and the output buffer contains the printed values of `mak` which is 3, `mak` which is 3, `i` which is 3, and `i` which is 3.**
