Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, i is i + 2, _ is 1, s is a string containing the input value, mak is 0, mak2 is 0, if s is '=', then pans is a list containing the values of i + 1 and i + 2, otherwise pans is a list containing the value of i + 1, the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, i + 1, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and the flushed output, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of mak, mak2 which is 0, i + 1 which is i + 2, and mak2 which is 0, and the input buffer is empty, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of mak, mak2 which is 0, i + 1 which is i + 2, and mak2 which is 0.***
