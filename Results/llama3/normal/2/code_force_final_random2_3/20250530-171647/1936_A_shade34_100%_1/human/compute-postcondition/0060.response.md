The `print` statement will print a string containing the values of `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `pans[i]`, and `pans[i]`.

Based on the precondition, `mak` is 1 if the input string `s` is '>', otherwise `mak` is 0. Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `mak`. However, we can describe its value as either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `s`.

`pans` is a list containing at least 3 values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<'. The exact values in the list are not provided, but we know that `pans[mak]` will be one of the values in the list, and `pans[i]` will be another value in the list.

Since `i` is 2, `pans[i]` will be the third value in the list (since indexing starts at 0).

The output will be a string containing the values of `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `pans[i]`, and `pans[i]`. Since `mak` is either 0 or 1, `pans[mak]` will be either the first or second value in the list. `pans[i]` will be the third value in the list.

Output: **[pans[mak]], [pans[mak]], [pans[i]], [pans[i]] (where pans[mak] is either the first or second value in the pans list, and pans[i] is the third value in the pans list)**
