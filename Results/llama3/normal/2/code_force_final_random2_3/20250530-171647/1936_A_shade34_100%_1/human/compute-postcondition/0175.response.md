Output: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `_` is 2, `s` is a string, `pans` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 input, the output buffer is flushed, and the string '?' and the values of `mak` and `i` are printed. If the input is '<', then `mak` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on the input, and this is printed: '?' [mak] [mak] [i] [i] where [mak] is either 0, 1, or `n-2` and [i] is `n-1`, and the output buffer is flushed, `mak2` is equal to `mak`. The string '?' and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` are printed, where `mak` and `mak2` are either 0, 1, or `n-2` and `i` is 0.**
