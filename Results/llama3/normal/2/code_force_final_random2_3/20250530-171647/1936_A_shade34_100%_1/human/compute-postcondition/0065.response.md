To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(pans)):`. The objects involved are `i` and `pans`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `pans` is a list containing at least 3 values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<'.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`. Since `i` is currently 2, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 3. Additionally, `pans` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again, since `i` is now 3 and the loop iterates up to `len(pans) - 1`.

The other variables `_`, `mak`, `mak2`, `n`, and `s` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `_` is 0, `mak` is 2 if the input string `s` is '>', otherwise `mak` is 1, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing at least 4 values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<', and the output buffer contains the updated printed values reflecting the changes in `i` and `pans`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the 1st or 2nd element of the list `pans` (depending on whether `s` is '>' or not), the same element again, the 3rd element of the list `pans` (which is the current value of `i`), and the same element again, and the output buffer is flushed.**
