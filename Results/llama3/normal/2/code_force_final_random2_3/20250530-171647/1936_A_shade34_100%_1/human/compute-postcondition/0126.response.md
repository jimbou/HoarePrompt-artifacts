Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `_` is 1, `s` is a string, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to `n-1` if the input string is '<', otherwise `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` if the input string is '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing the value of `n-1` if the input string is '<', otherwise `pans` is an empty list, the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of 0, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mak` is reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and the string '?' followed by the values of 0, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` is printed. The input buffer is still empty.
