Output: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `_` is 0, stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed. If the current value of the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, and this is printed: ? [2] [2] [2] [2], and the output buffer is flushed. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, and this is printed: ? [0] [0] [2] [2], and the output buffer is flushed. The value of `mak` and `i` are printed as: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i]**
