Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, _ is 2, s is the input string, stdin is empty. If s is '<', then mak is either 1 or 2, pans is either [1] or [2], and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2, where mak2 is either 0, 1, or n-3. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing either the value 1 or the values 1 and 2. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the state remains unchanged, with mak and mak2 being either 0, 1, or n-3, and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2, where mak is either 0, 1, or n-3, mak2 is either 0, 1, or n-3, and i is 2.**
