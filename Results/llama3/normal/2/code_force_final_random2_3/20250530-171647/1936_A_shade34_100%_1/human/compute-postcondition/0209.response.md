To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(pans)):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `pans`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `pans`. If `i` is less than the length of `pans`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `pans` is a list containing at least 2 values from 0 to `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The length of `pans` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing at least 3 values from 0 to `n-1`, the output buffer is empty, and the following string is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, where `mak2` is either 0, 1, or `n-2`. If the input string `s` is '>', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` is 0.**
