Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a string, `pans` is a list containing at least `len(pans)` elements, `stdin` contains 0 input, `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on the input, the output buffer is flushed, and the string '?' and the values of `mak` and `i` are printed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any pending output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the string '?' and the values of `mak` and `i` are printed. The value of `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on the input, and `i` is 2. The output buffer is now empty. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains 0 input because the input has been consumed.
