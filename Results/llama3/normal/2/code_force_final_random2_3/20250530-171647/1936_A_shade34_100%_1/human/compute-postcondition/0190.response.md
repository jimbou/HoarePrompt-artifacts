Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, _ is 2, s is the input string, stdin is empty, and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2, where mak and mak2 are either 0, 1, or n-3. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
