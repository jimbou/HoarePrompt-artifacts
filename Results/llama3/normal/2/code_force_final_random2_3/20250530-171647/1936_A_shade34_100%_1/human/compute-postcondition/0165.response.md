To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `n` does not need to be adjusted, as it is already at least 3.

The other variables, such as `mak`, `pans`, `stdin`, and the output buffer, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `_` is 2, `s` is a string, `pans` is a list containing at least `len(pans)` elements, `stdin` contains 0 input, the output buffer is flushed, and the string '?' and the values of `mak` and `i` are printed. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, otherwise, `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on the input.**
