Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than or equal to 1, i is n, _ is 0, stdin is empty, mak2 is equal to mak, pans is an empty list, and the output buffer contains the printed values of mak, i, and the conditional print statements.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 0, i is less than n, _ is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a string. If the input string s is '<', then mak is equal to i, mak2 is equal to i, pans is a list containing i, and the output buffer contains the printed values of i, i, and the conditional print statements, and this is printed: "? i i i i", followed by the flushed output. If the input string s is '=', then mak2 is equal to mak, pans is a list containing i, and the output buffer contains the printed values of mak, i, and the conditional print statements, and this is printed: "? mak mak2 i mak2", followed by the flushed output. If the input string s is neither '<' nor '=', then mak2 is equal to mak, pans is an empty list, and the output buffer contains the printed values of mak, i, and the conditional print statements, and this is printed: "? mak mak2 i mak2", followed by the flushed output.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 0, i is one more than its previous value, n is greater than the new value of i, s is a string containing the input value. If s is '<', the output is '?' , mak is equal to the new value of i, and pans is a list containing the new value of i. If s is '=', the output is '?' , mak, mak2, the new value of i which is one more than its previous value, and mak2, and pans is a list containing the new value of i. If s is neither '<' nor '=', the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 0, i is one more than its previous value plus one, n is greater than the new value of i, s is a string containing the input value, mak is equal to the new value of i, pans is a list containing the new value of i. If s is '<', the output is '?' , the value of mak, the value of mak2, the new value of i, and the value of mak2. If s is '=', pans is a list containing the new value of i twice. Otherwise, the output is '?' , the value of mak, the value of mak2, the new value of i, and the value of mak2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
