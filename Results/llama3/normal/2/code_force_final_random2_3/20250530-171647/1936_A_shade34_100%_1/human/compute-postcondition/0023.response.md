To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list, and the output buffer contains the printed values of `mak`, `i`, and the conditional print statements.**
