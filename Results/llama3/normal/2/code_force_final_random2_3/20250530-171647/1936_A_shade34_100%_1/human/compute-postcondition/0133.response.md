Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a string, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of 0, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, and the following is printed: '?' followed by the values of the first element of the `pans` list, the first element of the `pans` list, the second element of the `pans` list, and the second element of the `pans` list, and the output buffer is flushed. If the input string is '>', then `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 0. Otherwise, `mak` is 0 and `mak2` is `n-1` if the input string is '<', otherwise `mak2` is 0.***
