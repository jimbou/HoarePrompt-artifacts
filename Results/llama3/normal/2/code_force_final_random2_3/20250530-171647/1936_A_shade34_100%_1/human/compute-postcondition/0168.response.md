Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `_` is 2, `s` is a string, `pans` is a list containing at least `len(pans)` elements, `stdin` contains 0 input, the output buffer is flushed, and the string '?' and the values of `mak` and `i` are printed. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, otherwise, `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on the input, and this is printed: '?' [mak] [mak] [i] [i] where [mak] is either 0, 1, or 2 and [i] is 3, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the code `sys.stdout.flush()` only flushes the output buffer, which means it forces the output to be displayed immediately, but it does not change the values of any variables or the state of the input buffer.
