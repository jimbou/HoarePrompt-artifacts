Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `_` is 0, `mak` is 3, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing at least 4 values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<', the output buffer contains the updated printed values reflecting the changes in `i` and `pans`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the 1st or 2nd element of the list `pans` (depending on whether `s` is '>' or not), the same element again, the 3rd element of the list `pans` (which is the current value of `i`), and the same element again, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
