The code prints an exclamation mark, the value of `mak2`, and the value at index `mak` in the list `pans`. 
`mak2` is either 0, 1, or `n-2` and `mak` is `n-1`. 
`pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1`.
Output: **!(exclamation mark), [mak2] (where mak2 is either 0, 1, or n-2), [n-1] (which is the value at index n-1 in the list pans)**
