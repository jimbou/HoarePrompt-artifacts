Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `_` is 2, `s` is a string, `pans` is a list containing at least `len(pans)` elements, `stdin` contains 0 input, the output buffer is flushed, and the string '?' and the values of `mak` and `i` are printed. If the input is '<', then `mak` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on the input, and this is printed: '?' [mak] [mak] [i] [i] where [mak] is either 0, 1, or `n-2` and [i] is `n-1`, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now equal to `n`. The value of `mak` depends on the input received during the last iteration of the loop. If the input was '<', then `mak` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains either 0 or 1, depending on the input received during the previous iterations. The output buffer is flushed, and the string '?' along with the values of `mak` and `i` are printed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
