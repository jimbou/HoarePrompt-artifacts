Output State: **n is an integer, i is equal to len(pans), _ is 2, s is a string, pans is a list containing at least len(pans) elements, mak is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was initially greater than or equal to 0, it is now an integer. The second line assigns 0 to `mak`. No other variables are affected.
