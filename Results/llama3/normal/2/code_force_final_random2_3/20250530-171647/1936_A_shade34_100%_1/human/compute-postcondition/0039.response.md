Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is one more than its previous value, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `s` is a string containing the input value, the output is '?' , `mak`, `mak2`, the new value of `i` which is one more than its previous value, and `mak2`, `pans` is a list containing the new value of `i`**.

In this output state, the value of `i` is still one more than its previous value, and `n` is still greater than the new value of `i`. The string `s` still contains the input value, and the output is still '?' , `mak`, `mak2`, the new value of `i`, and `mak2`. The only change is that `pans` is now a list containing the new value of `i`, which was appended to it by the executed code.
