The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is one more than its previous value, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **n is greater than 0, i is one more than its previous value plus one, n is greater than the new value of i, s is a string containing the input value. If s is '<', the output is '?' , mak is equal to the new value of i, and pans is a list containing the new value of i. If s is '=', the output is '?' , mak, mak2, the new value of i which is one more than its previous value, and mak2, and pans is a list containing the new value of i. If s is neither '<' nor '=', the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
