Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, `s` is a string, `pans` is a list containing at least `len(pans)` elements, `stdin` contains 1 input, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 1 and the current value of `stdin` is '<'. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.***
