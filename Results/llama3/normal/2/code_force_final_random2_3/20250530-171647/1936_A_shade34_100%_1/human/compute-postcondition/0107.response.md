Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is less than n, _ is 1, mak is 0, mak2 is 0, if s is '=', then pans is a list containing the value of i. The output buffer contains the printed values of 0, i, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i, and the value of mak2. The output buffer also contains the flushed output. If s is not '=', then pans is an empty list.***
