The code prints a string containing a question mark '?' followed by the values of the elements at indices `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i` in the `pans` list.
Since `mak` is 0 and `i` is 1, the printed string will contain the first and second elements of the `pans` list, repeated twice.
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and pans[1] is the second element of the pans list)**
