Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, _ is 2, s is the input string, mak is 2, pans is [2], and the output buffer contains the string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2, where mak2 is either 0, 1, or n-3. If s is '<', then mak2 is 1. If s is '=', then mak2 is 0. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then mak2 is either 0, 1, or n-3.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `mak` and creates a list `pans` containing the value of `i`. Since `i` is 2, `mak` becomes 2 and `pans` becomes `[2]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the string '?' and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, but now `mak` is 2. The value of `mak2` depends on the value of `s`: if `s` is '<', then `mak2` is 1; if `s` is '=', then `mak2` is 0; otherwise, `mak2` is either 0, 1, or `n-3`.
