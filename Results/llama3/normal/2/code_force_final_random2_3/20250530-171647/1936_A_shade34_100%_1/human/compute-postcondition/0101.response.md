Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is less than n, _ is 1, mak is equal to n-1 if the input string is '<', otherwise mak is 0, mak2 is equal to mak, pans is an empty list, and the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, i, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i, and the value of mak2, s is a string equal to the input string, and the output buffer also contains the flushed output.**

The first line flushes the output buffer, which means that any pending output is immediately printed. The second line reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The value of `s` is now equal to the input string. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
