Output State: **n is an integer that must be greater than 0, i is 0, _ is 2, s is a string equal to '<', pans is a list containing a single element 0, stdin contains 0 input, the output buffer is flushed, and the string '?' and the values of mak and i are printed. If the input is '<', then mak is n-1. Otherwise, mak is either 0 or 1 depending on the input, and this is printed: '?' [mak] [mak] [i] [i] where [mak] is either 0, 1, or n-2 and [i] is n-1, and the output buffer is flushed, mak2 is equal to mak. The string '?' and the values of mak, mak2, i, and mak2 are printed, where mak and mak2 are either 0, 1, or n-2 and i is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` is now equal to `i`, which is 0. The list `pans` now contains a single element, which is also 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
