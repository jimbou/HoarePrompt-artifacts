Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the input value, `i` is equal to 3, `_` is 1, `mak` is equal to 2 if the input string is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<', the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '!', 0, and the value at index `mak` of the list `pans` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise the value at index `mak` of the list `pans` which is 0, and the output buffer is flushed, `n` must be greater than 3, and this is printed: '?' , 0, 0, 1, 1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' , `mak` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` which is 2, `mak` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` which is 2, `i` which is 3, and `i` which is 3, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' , `mak` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` which is 2, `mak` which is 0 if the input string is not '<', otherwise `mak` which is 2, `i` which is 3, and `i` which is 3, and the output buffer is flushed, and the output buffer is flushed again.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any pending output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer already contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, as well as the printed values of '!', 0, and the value at index `mak` of the list `pans`, and the output buffer has been flushed multiple times before. Therefore, the output state remains the same, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed again.
