Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `_` is 0, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` for which the input string `s` was '=' or '<', and the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 0, and since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, its value is also updated to 0. The other variables and the output buffer remain unchanged.
