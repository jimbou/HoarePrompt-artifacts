Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 values from 0 to `n-1`, `mak` is 1, the output buffer is empty, and the following string is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, where `mak2` is either 0, 1, or `n-2`. The current value of the input string `s` is '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mak` is updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer is still empty, and the same string is printed as before. The input string `s` is still '>'.
