Based on the initial state, the print statement will print the string '?' followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.

The value of `mak` depends on the value of the input string `s`. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1. If `s` is '=', then `pans` is a list containing the value 1, but the value of `mak` is not explicitly defined in this case. If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', then the state remains unchanged, and `mak` can be either 0, 1, or n-3.

The value of `mak2` is either 0, 1, or n-3, regardless of the value of `s`.

The value of `i` is 2.

The output buffer already contains the string '?' and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, but this does not affect the print statement.

Therefore, the print statement will print the string '?' followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, where `mak` is either 1 (if `s` is '<'), or an unspecified value (if `s` is '='), or either 0, 1, or n-3 (if `s` is neither '<' nor '='), and `mak2` is either 0, 1, or n-3, and `i` is 2.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 2 [mak2] (where [mak] is either 1, or an unspecified value, or either 0, 1, or n-3, and [mak2] is either 0, 1, or n-3)**
