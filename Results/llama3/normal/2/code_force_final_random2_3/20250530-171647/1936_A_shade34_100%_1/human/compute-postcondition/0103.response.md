Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is less than n, _ is 1, mak is equal to i, mak2 is equal to mak, pans is a list containing the value of i, and the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, i, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak, the value of mak2, the value of i, and the value of mak2, s is a string equal to '<', and the output buffer also contains the flushed output.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to be equal to `i`, and `pans` now contains the value of `i`. All other variables and the output buffer remain unchanged.
