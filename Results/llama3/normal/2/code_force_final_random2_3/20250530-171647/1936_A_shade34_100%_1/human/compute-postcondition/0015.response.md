The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `_` is 0, stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed. If the current value of the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, and this is printed: ? [2] [2] [2] [2], and the output buffer is flushed. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, and this is printed: ? [0] [0] [2] [2], and the output buffer is flushed.**
