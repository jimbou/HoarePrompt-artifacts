Postcondition: **The program has executed the if-else block, and the state of the variables is as follows: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `_` is 2, and `pans` is either an empty list or a list containing 0. The string '?' and the values of `mak` and `i` have been printed, where `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on the input, and the output buffer is flushed. Additionally, if `s` is '=', then `s` is '=' and `pans` contains 0, otherwise, `s` is not '=' and `pans` is an empty list. The string '?' and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` have been printed, where `mak` and `mak2` are either 0, 1, or n-2 and `i` is 0.**
