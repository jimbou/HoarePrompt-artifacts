Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing at least 3 values from 0 to `n-1`, the output buffer is empty, and the following string is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`, where `mak2` is either 0, 1, or `n-2`. If the input string `s` is '>', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` is 0. The output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed. This means that any pending output in the buffer is immediately written to the output device, but the values of the variables and the printed string remain the same.
