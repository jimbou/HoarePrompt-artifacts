To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`. The value of `n` remains the same.

The other variables, `_`, `s`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

The output buffer contains the printed values of the previous iterations, but its state does not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `_` is 1, `s` is a string, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` (if `s` is '<' or '='), the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and the flushed output.**
