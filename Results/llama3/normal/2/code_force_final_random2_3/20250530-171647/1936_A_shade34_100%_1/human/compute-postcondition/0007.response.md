Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, `_` is 0, stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed. The current value of the input is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables, `n`, `_`, and the state of the input buffer and output buffer remain unchanged. The current value of the input is still '<'.
