Output: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `s` is a string, `pans` is a list containing at least `len(pans)` elements, `stdin` contains 1 input, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 1 and the current value of `stdin` is '<'. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0. The string '?' and the values of `mak` (which is either 0 or 1 depending on the input), `i` (which is 2) are being printed**
