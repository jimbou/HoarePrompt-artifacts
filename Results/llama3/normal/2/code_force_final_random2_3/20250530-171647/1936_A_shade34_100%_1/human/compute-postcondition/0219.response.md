Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 3, `_` is 2, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing at least 4 values from 0 to `n-1`. If the input string `s` is '>', then `mak` is 3, otherwise `mak` is 3. The output buffer is empty, and the following string is printed: '?' followed by the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the first element of the list `pans` (at index 0), the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the second element of the list `pans` (at index 1), and the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`. The output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `mak` is now 3, regardless of the input string `s`. The output buffer is still empty, and the same string is printed as before. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
