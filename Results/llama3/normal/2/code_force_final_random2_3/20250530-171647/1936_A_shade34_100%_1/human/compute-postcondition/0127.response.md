To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `pans`. The loop will execute if `pans` has at least 2 elements, since the range starts from 1. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `s` is a string, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to `n-1` if the input string is '<', otherwise `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, the output buffer contains the printed values of 0, `i`, and the conditional print statements for all iterations of the loop, and this is printed: '?' followed by the values of 0, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.**
