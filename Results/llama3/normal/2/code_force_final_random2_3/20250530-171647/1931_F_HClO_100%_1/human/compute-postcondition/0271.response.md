Output State: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is greater than i+1, m is an integer, i is increased by 1, idx1 is equal to the original value of i, p1 is 1.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1` and sets `p1` to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is increased by 1, but this change is not reflected in the value of `idx1`, which is assigned the original value of `i`. The condition `i + max(p1, p2)` is not evaluated in this code snippet, so no additional changes occur.
