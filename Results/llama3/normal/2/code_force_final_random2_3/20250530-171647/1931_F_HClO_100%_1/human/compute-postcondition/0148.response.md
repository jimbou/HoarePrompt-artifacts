Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, and `i` is 0. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `p1` is set to 1, `idx1` is set to `i`, and `idx2` remains -1. Otherwise, `p2` is set to 1, `idx2` is set to `i`, and `idx1` remains -1.***
