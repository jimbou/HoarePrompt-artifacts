Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, and `i` is 0. The current value of `idx1` is at least 0 and the current value of `idx2` is at least 0. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then the current value of `p1` is 1, the current value of `idx1` is `i`, and the current value of `idx2` is -1. Otherwise, the current value of `p2` is 1, the current value of `idx2` is `i`, and the current value of `idx1` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is currently inside. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the innermost loop or if statement.
