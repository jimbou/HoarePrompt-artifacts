Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, and the program has accepted and discarded `m - 2` lines of input from the user, and 'no' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. All variables retain their original values and properties, and the program has still accepted and discarded `m - 2` lines of input from the user, and 'no' is printed.
