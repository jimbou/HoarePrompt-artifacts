Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, and `i` is 0. The current value of `idx1` is at least 0 and the current value of `idx2` is at least 0. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then the current value of `p1` is 1, the current value of `idx1` is `i`, and the current value of `idx2` is -1. Otherwise, the current value of `p2` is 1, the current value of `idx2` is `i`, and the current value of `idx1` is -1.**
