The code `input()` accepts a string from the standard input. Since the stdin is empty, this will cause the program to wait for user input. Once the user enters a string and presses enter, the input will be discarded because it is not assigned to any variable.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `stdin` is empty, and the program is waiting for user input.**
