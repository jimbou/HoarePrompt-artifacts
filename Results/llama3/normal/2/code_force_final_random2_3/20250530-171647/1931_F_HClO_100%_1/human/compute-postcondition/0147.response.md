Output State: **t is at least 2, m is an integer, n is at least 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0, p2 is 1, val is an empty list, a3 is the last a3 in the last tuple, l3 is the last l3 in the last tuple, idx1 is -1, idx2 is i, and i is 0.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `idx2` and `p2`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`, and the second line assigns the value of `1` to `p2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
