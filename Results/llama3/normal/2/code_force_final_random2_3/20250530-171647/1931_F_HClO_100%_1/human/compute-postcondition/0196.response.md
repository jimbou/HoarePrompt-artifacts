Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1. If `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is -1, then the current value of `idx2` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, the current values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged. `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `m` is 2, then the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and the next iteration of the loop is moved to. Otherwise, the values of `m`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged. stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. The index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
