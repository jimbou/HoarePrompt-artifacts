Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `i` is `i + 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and conditions, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
