Output State: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is equal to n-1, idx1 is not less than idx2, and idx1 is less than or equal to idx2. The current value of a3 is the first integer from the input, and the current value of l3 is the rest of the integers from the input. l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2. l is a list of integers equal to l1. The index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3.**

In this output state, the values of `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `a3`, `l3`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only modifies `l1` by inserting `a1` at index `idx2`, and assigns the modified `l1` to `l`. The relationship between the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` also remains unchanged.
