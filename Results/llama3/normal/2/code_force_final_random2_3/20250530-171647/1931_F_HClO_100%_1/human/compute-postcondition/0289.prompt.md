Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is at least 2, m is an integer. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2], then one of the following occurs: if l1[i + p1] is equal to a2 and l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, then idx1 is set to i and idx2 is set to i. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2 but l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1, then p1 is set to 1, idx1 is set to i and no change occurs to p2 and idx2. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to a2 but l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, then p2 is set to 1, idx2 is set to i and no change occurs to p1 and idx1. If neither l1[i + p1] is equal to a2 nor l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, then p2 is set to 1, idx2 is set to i and no change occurs to p1 and idx1. If both idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If l1[i + p1] is equal to l2[i + p2], then no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is greater than `i+1`, `m` is an integer, `i` is increased by 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is the original value of `i` and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2`, then `idx2` is `i` and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is greater than `i+2`, `m` is an integer, `i` is increased by 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `idx1` is equal to `i` and `idx2` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is equal to `i` and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is equal to `i` and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
