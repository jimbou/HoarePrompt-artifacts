Output State: **t is at least 2, m is either 1 or 2, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list containing at least one tuple (a3, l3) and any previously appended tuples, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1. If idx1 < idx2, then the current value of l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, the current value of l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and idx2 is either -1 or n - 2. If idx1 is not less than idx2, then either the current value of l11 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and the current value of l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, or the current value of l22 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and the current value of l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, depending on whether l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2) or not. Additionally, if idx1 > idx2, then the current value of m is decreased by 1. Stdin is empty. The current value of l3 is not equal to the list of integers in l excluding a3, and 'no' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain the same, with the exception that if idx1 > idx2, then the value of m is decreased by 1. The stdin is still empty, and the current value of l3 is still not equal to the list of integers in l excluding a3.
