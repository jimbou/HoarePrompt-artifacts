Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing the string 'yes', `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is equal to 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, and 'yes' is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. All variables maintain their original values and conditions, and the printing of 'yes' continues.
