Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code executes a `break` statement, which means we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of all variables remain unchanged, but we break out of the loop or if statement.
