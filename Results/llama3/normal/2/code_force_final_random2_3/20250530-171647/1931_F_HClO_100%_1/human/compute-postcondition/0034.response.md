Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is either 0 or m - 2, n is at least 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is -1, idx2 is i, p1 is 0, p2 is 1, stdin contains m - 3 inputs: strings, i is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `p1`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only changes are that `idx2` is now equal to `i`, and `p2` is now equal to 1.
