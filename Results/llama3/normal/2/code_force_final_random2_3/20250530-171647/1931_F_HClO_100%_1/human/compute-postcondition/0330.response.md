The only objects in the loop head are variables  `a3` and `l3` and list `val`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `val`.  If the list has at least 2 tuples the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `val` has at least 1 tuple, `a3` is the first integer in the first tuple of `val`, `l3` is the first list of integers in the first tuple of `val`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 tuples and the `a3` is the first integer in the second tuple of `val` and `l3` is the first list of integers in the second tuple of `val`.
State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of an integer and a list of integers, `a3` is the first integer in the second tuple of `val`, `l3` is the first list of integers in the second tuple of `val`, `t` is at least 3, `_` is `m-2`, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is equal to `n-1`.**
