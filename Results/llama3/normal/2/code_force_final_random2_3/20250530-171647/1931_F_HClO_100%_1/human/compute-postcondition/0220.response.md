Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a4, l4)` and any previously appended tuples, `a4` is an integer, `l4` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` have specific conditions based on their values, `l` is a list of integers with specific insertions based on `idx1` and `idx2`, `l2` is a list of integers with specific insertions based on `idx1` and `idx2`, Stdin is empty, 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and conditions. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
