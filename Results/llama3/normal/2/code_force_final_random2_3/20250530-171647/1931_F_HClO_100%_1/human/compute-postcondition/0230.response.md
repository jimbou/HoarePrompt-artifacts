The code `input()` accepts a space-separated list of integers from the stdin and discards it. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin is now empty, we won't include it in the output state.

Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer.**
