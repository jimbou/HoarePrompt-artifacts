This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints 'yes' or 'no' for each test case. It accepts an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n * k <= 2 * 10^5) followed by k lines, each containing n integers (1 <= a_ij <= n, all a_ij are different). The function checks if the input data satisfies certain conditions and prints 'yes' if the conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'no'.
