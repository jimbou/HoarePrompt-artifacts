Postcondition: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is at least 2, m is an integer, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1. If i + max(p1, p2) equals n - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. The current value of l1[i + p1] is equal to a2. l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1.**
