Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is at least 2, m is an integer, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and idx2 is either -1 or n - 2. If idx1 is not less than idx2, then either l11 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, or l22 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, depending on whether l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2) or not. Additionally, if idx1 > idx2, then m is decreased by 1 and val is a list containing the tuple (a3, l3).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 2, m is an integer that must be at least 2, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list containing the tuple (a3, l3) and any previously appended tuples, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and idx2 is either -1 or n - 2. If idx1 is not less than idx2, then either l11 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, or l22 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, depending on whether l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2) or not. Additionally, if idx1 > idx2, then m is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, m is an integer that must be at least 2, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list containing the tuple (a3, l3) and any previously appended tuples, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and idx2 is either -1 or n - 2. If idx1 is not less than idx2, then either l11 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, or l22 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, depending on whether l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2) or not. Additionally, if idx1 > idx2, then m is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 2, m is an integer that must be at least 2, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list containing the tuple (a3, l3) and any previously appended tuples, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and idx2 is either -1 or n - 2. If idx1 is not less than idx2, then either l11 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, or l22 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, depending on whether l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2) or not. Additionally, if idx1 > idx2, then m is decreased by 1. Stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
