The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is an integer and `t` is at least 2, but these do not ensure that the loop will execute, so `m` needs to be adjusted to be at least 3 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value**
