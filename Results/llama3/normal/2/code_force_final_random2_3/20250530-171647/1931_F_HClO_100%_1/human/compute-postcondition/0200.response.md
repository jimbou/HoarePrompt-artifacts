Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)`, then `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` and `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` and `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.**
