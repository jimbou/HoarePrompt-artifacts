Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m` - 2, `n` is greater than 3, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is at least 2. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is at least 2 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is at least 2 and `p2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the break statement are still true.
