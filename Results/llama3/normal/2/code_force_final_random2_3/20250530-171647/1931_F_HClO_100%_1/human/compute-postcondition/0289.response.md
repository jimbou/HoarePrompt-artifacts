Output State: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, idx1 is either -1 or a value between 0 and n-1, idx2 is either -1 or a value between 0 and n-1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is equal to n-1.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations. The variables a1, a2, l11, l22, val, a3, l3, t, _, n, and m remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The variables idx1 and idx2 can be either -1 (if the loop broke due to the condition i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1) or a value between 0 and n-1 (if the loop broke due to the condition idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0). The variables p1 and p2 can be either 0 or 1, depending on the values of l1[i + p1] and l2[i + p2] during the last iteration. The variable i is equal to n-1, indicating that the loop has executed all its iterations.
