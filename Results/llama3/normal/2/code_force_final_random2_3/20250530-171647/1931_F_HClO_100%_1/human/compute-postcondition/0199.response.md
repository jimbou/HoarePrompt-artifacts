Output State: **t is at least 2, m is an integer, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is an empty list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, idx1 is not less than idx2 and idx1 is less than or equal to idx2, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1.**

The code modifies the list `l2` by inserting `a2` at index `idx1`, and then assigns this modified list to `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The index of `a1` in `l3` is still not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`. The values of `m`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` are unchanged.
