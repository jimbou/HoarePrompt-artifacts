Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `i` is `i + 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the values of `l1[i + p1]` and `l2[i + p2]` relative to `a1` and `a2`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
