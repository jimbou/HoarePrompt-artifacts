Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m` - 2, `n` is greater than 3, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is at least 2. If `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
