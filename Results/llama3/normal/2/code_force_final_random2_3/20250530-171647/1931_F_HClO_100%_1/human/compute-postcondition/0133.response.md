Output State: **`_` is `m - 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, stdin contains no input, we have read `m - 2` inputs from stdin which are not assigned to any variable, 'no' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, and we have not read any new inputs from stdin. The only change is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
