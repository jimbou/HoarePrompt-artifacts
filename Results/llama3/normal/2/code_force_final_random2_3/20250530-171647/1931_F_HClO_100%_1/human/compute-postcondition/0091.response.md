To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 2` is at least 1, meaning `m` must be at least 3. Since `_` is the loop variable, it will start at 0.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is either an empty list or a list of tuples containing (a3, l3), `l3` is a list of integers, `idx1` is either -1, n - 2, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, n - 2, or its original value**
