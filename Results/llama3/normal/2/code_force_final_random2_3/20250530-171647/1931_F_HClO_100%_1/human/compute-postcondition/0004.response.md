The code `input()` accepts a string from the input. Since the stdin contains a space-separated list of integers except the first two inputs which have been taken by `n` and `m`, the first input in the stdin is taken by `input()`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers except the first three inputs which have been taken by `n`, `m` and `input()`. 

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers, `m` is 1, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers except the first three inputs which have been taken by `n`, `m` and `input()`.**
