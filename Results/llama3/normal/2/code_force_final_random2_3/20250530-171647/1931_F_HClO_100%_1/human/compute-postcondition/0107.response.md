Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) that must have at least 2 tuples, `a3` is the first a3 in the second tuple, `l3` is the first l3 in the second tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, 'no' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The program simply stops executing the current loop or if statement and moves on to the next line of code.
