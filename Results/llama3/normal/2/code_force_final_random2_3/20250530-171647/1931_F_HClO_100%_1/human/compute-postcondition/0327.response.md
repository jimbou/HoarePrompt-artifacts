Output: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of an integer and a list of integers, `a3` is the first integer in the first tuple of `val`, `l3` is the first list of integers in the first tuple of `val`, `t` is at least 3, `_` is `m-2`, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is equal to `n-1`, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `l3` is not equal to the list of integers that results from removing `a3` from `l`, and 'no' is being printed**
