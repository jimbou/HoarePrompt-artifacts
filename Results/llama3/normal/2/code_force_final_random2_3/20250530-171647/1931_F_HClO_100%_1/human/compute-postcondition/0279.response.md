Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is greater than `i+2`, `m` is an integer, `i` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values, and we simply add the fact that we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
