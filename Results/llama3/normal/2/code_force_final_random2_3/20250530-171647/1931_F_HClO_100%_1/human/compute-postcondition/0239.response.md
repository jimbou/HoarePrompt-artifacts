The code `input()` accepts a line of input from stdin. Since stdin contains no input, this will cause the program to wait for user input. Once the user enters a line of input and presses enter, the input will be discarded because it is not assigned to any variable.

Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, stdin contains no input, and the program has accepted and discarded a line of input from the user.**
