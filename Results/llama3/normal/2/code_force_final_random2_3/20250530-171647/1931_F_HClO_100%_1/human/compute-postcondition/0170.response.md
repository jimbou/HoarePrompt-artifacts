Output State: **t is at least 2, m is an integer, n is at least i + 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is an empty list, a3 is the last a3 in the last tuple, l3 is the last l3 in the last tuple, i is i + 1, idx2 is i, p2 is 1.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for `idx2` and `p2`, which are newly introduced. `idx2` is assigned the value of `i`, and `p2` is set to 1. The rest of the variables retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
