Output State: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is 1, p2 is 0, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is at least 2, m is an integer, idx1 is i, idx2 is -1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `idx1` and `p1`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`, and the second line sets `p1` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the loop or if statement is not affected by the code snippet, as it only checks the values of `i`, `p1`, and `p2`, but does not modify them. The values of `l1[i + p1]` and `l2[i + p2]` are not affected by the code snippet, as they are not modified.
