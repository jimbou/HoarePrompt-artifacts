Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m` - 2, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` is either `i` or -1, `idx2` is either `i` or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1. If `i + max(p1, p2)` is equal to `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. `i` is at least 1***
