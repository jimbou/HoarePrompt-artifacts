Output State: **t is at least 2, m is an integer, n is at least 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 1, p2 is 0, val is an empty list, a3 is the last a3 in the last tuple, l3 is the last l3 in the last tuple, idx1 is i, idx2 is -1, and i is 0.**

The code modifies the values of `idx1` and `p1`. The first line assigns the current value of `i` to `idx1`, and the second line sets `p1` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
