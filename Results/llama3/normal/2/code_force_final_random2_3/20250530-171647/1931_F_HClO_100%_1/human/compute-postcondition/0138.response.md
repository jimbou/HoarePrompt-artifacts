Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, and `i` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` still equals `n` minus 1.
