Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or m - 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is either -1 or the index where `l1[idx1]` equals `a2` and `l2[idx1]` equals `a1`, `idx2` is either -1 or the index where `l1[idx2]` equals `a2` and `l2[idx2]` equals `a1`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `val` is introduced, which is an empty list.
