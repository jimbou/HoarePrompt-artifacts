Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2` retain their initial values. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `l` is equal to `l1`. Otherwise, `a3` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `l3` is assigned the rest of the integers from the input. `val` is a list of tuples with the tuple (`a3`, `l3`) appended to it. `m` is decreased by 1. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l1`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l2`.***
