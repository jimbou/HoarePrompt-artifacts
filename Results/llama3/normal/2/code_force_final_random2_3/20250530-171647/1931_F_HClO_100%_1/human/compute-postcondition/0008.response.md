Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers except the first two inputs which have been taken by `n` and `m`. If `m` is 1, 'yes' is printed and the program moves to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise, the program continues without printing 'yes'***
