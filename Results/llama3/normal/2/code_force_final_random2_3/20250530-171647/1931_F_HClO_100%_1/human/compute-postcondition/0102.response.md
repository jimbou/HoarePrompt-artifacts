Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) that must have at least 1 tuple, `a3` is the first a3 in the first tuple, `l3` is the first l3 in the first tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, 'no' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and 'no' is still being printed.
