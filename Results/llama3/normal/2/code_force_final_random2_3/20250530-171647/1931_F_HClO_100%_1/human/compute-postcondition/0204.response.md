To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `_` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0, i.e., `m` is at least 3.


State: **t is at least 2, m is an integer that must be at least 3, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and idx2 is either -1 or n - 2. If idx1 is not less than idx2, then either l11 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, or l22 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, depending on whether l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2) or not. Additionally, if idx1 > idx2, then m is decreased by 1 and val is a list containing the tuple (a3, l3).**
