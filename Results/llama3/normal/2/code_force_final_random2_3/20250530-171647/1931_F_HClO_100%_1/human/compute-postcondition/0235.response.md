Output State: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, t is at least 3, _ is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer.**

The code snippet reads two lines of input, each containing a list of integers. The first line assigns the first integer to `a1` and the remaining integers to `l1`. The second line assigns the first integer to `a2` and the remaining integers to `l2`. Then, it filters out `a2` from `l1` and assigns the result to `l11`, and filters out `a1` from `l2` and assigns the result to `l22`. The values of `a3`, `l3`, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `_`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
