Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n * k <= 2 * 10^5) followed by k lines, each containing n integers (1 <= a_ij <= n, all a_ij are different).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4. The stdin now contains t test cases, each consisting of two integers n and k, followed by k lines of n integers. The values of n and k, as well as the integers in each line, are still unknown and will be determined by the subsequent inputs.
