Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, stdin contains one less input.**

The code `input()` accepts an input from the user, but it does not assign the input to any variable. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same. However, since an input has been accepted, the stdin now contains one less input.
