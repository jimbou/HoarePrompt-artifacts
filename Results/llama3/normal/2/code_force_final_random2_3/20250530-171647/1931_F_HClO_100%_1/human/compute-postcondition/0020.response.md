Output State: **_ is `m - 2`, `stdin` contains `m - 3` inputs: strings, and 'no' is being printed**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next one. Since 'no' is being printed, it means we are inside a loop or a conditional statement. The value of `_` remains the same, which is `m - 2`. The `stdin` contains `m - 2` inputs initially, but since we are moving to the next iteration, one input is consumed, leaving `m - 3` inputs in `stdin`. The printing of 'no' is not affected by the `continue` statement, so it continues to be printed.
