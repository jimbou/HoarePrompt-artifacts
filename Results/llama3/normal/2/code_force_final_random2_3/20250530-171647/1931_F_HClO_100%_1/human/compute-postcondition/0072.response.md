Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is either 0 or m - 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, idx1 is less than idx2, l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1.**

The code snippet modifies the list `l2` by inserting the value of `a2` at the index `idx1`. This change is then reflected in the assignment of `l2` to `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The relationship between `idx1` and `idx2` remains the same, with `idx1` being less than `idx2`.
