Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, stdin is empty**

The code executes two lines that read input from stdin, assigning the first integer to `a1` and the rest to `l1`, and the first integer to `a2` and the rest to `l2`. The third and fourth lines create new lists `l11` and `l22` by filtering out `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2`, respectively. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Stdin is now empty after the two input lines.
