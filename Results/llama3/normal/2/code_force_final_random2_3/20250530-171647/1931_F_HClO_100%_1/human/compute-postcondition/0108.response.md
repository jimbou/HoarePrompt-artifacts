Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) that must have at least 2 tuples, `a3` is the first a3 in the second tuple, `l3` is the first l3 in the second tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
