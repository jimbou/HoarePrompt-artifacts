Postcondition: ***a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is at least 2, m is an integer. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2, then the current value of p1 is 1, the current value of idx1 is i and no change occurs to p2 and idx2. Otherwise, the current value of p2 is 1, the current value of idx2 is i and no change occurs to p1 and idx1. The current values of idx1 and idx2 are both greater than or equal to 0.***
