The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 4, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 4, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1 and `m` must be at least 4. So `_` is 2 and `m` is at least 4.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `m` is at least 4, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, stdin contains no input.**
