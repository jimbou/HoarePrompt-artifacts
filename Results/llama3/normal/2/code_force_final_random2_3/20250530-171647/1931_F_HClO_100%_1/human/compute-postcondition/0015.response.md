To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `m - 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1 and `m` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `m` remains the same, but since `_` is now 2, `m` must be at least 4 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 4, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `stdin` contains one input: a string**
