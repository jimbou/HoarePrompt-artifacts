Postcondition: ***a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, m is an integer. If l11 is not equal to l22, the program has accepted and discarded m - 2 lines of input from the user, 'no' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
