To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `m`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 3.

Since `_` is the loop variable, its value will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `_` will be 2.

The other variables are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 2, `m` is at least 3, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3), `l3` is a list of integers, `idx1` is either -1, n - 2, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, n - 2, or its original value, `a3` is an integer, stdin contains no input**
