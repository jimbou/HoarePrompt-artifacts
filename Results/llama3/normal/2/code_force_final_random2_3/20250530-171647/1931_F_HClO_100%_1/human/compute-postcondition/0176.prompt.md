Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, m is an integer, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, val is an empty list, a3 is the last a3 in the last tuple, l3 is the last l3 in the last tuple, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1. If m equals 1, 'yes' has been printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the values of m, n, a1, a2, l11, l22, p1, p2, val, a3, l3, idx1, and idx2 remain unchanged. a1 is the first integer from the first line of stdin, l1 is the rest of the integers from the first line of stdin, a2 is the first integer from the second line of stdin, l2 is the rest of the integers from the second line of stdin, l11 is a list of integers from l1 excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers from l2 excluding a1, stdin is empty. If l11 is not equal to l22, _ is m - 2, 'no' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `i`. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `p1` is set to 1, `idx1` is set to `i`, and `idx2` remains -1. Otherwise, `p2` is set to 1, `idx2` is set to `i`, and `idx1` remains -1. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both at least 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, and `i` is `i + 1` if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` does not equal `a1`, then `p1` is 1 and `idx1` is `i`. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `p2` is 1 and `idx2` is `i`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`, then no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `i` is `i + 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the values of `l1[i + p1]` and `l2[i + p2]` relative to `a1` and `a2`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
