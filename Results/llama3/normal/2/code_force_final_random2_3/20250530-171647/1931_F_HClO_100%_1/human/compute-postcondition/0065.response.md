Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m - 2`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is the index where `l1[idx2]` equals `a2` and `l2[idx2]` equals `a1`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list. The current value of `idx1` is -1, and the current value of `idx2` is not -1, indicating that `l1` and `l2` have a matching pair at index `idx2` but not at index `idx1`.**
