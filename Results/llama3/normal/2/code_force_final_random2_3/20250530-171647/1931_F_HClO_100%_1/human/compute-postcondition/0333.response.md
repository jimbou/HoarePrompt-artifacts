Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of an integer and a list of integers, `a3` is the first integer in the second tuple of `val`, `l3` is the first list of integers in the second tuple of `val`, `t` is at least 3, `_` is `m-2`, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values and properties, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or conditional statement, without modifying any variables. The program execution is halted, and no further changes are made to the variables.
