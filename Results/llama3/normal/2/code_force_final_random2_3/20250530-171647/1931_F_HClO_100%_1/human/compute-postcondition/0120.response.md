Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is `m - 1`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, 'yes' has been printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that 'yes' has been printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration.
