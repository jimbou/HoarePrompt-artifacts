Output State: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is 0, p2 is 1, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is at least 2, m is an integer, idx1 is -1, idx2 is i.**

The code modifies the values of `idx2` and `p2`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`, and the second line sets `p2` to 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state's conditions and constraints that are not modified by the code remain valid.
