Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m - 2`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is not -1, and `idx2` is `n - 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `idx2` has been updated to `n - 2`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `idx1` is still not -1, and all other variables retain their initial values and properties.
