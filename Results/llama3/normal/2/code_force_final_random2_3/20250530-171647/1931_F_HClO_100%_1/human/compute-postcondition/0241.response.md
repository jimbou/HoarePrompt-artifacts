Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 4, and the program has accepted and discarded two lines of input from the user.**

The code `input()` accepts and discards a line of input from the user. Since the initial state already mentions that the program has accepted and discarded a line of input, the output state will reflect that the program has now accepted and discarded two lines of input. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
