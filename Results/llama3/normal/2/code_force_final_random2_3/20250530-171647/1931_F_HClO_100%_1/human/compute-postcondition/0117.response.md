Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is `m - 1`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of two integers from the input, stdin contains no input.**

The code `input()` accepts a line of input from the user, but it does not assign the input to any variable. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same, except that the stdin is now empty because the input has been consumed.
