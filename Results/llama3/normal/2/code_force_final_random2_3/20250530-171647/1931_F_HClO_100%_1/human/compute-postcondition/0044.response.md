Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is either 0 or m - 2, n is greater than 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is i, idx2 is i, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is at least 1.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`, updating their values. No other variables are affected by the code. The state of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remains unchanged.
