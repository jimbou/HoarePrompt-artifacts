Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m` - 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is either `i` or -1, `idx2` is either `i` or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains `m` - 3 inputs: strings, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current values of `idx1` and `idx2` are still both greater than or equal to 0.
