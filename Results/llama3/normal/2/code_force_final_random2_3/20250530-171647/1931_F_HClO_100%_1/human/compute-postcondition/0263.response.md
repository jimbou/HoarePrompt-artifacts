Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer. If `l11[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then the current value of `p1` is 1, the current value of `idx1` is `i` and no change occurs to `p2` and `idx2`. Otherwise, the current value of `p2` is 1, the current value of `idx2` is `i` and no change occurs to `p1` and `idx1`. The current values of `idx1` and `idx2` are both greater than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
