Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is greater than `i+1`, `m` is an integer, `i` is increased by 1, `idx2` is equal to `i`, `p2` is 1.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx2` and sets `p2` to 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state's conditions and values for all other variables remain unchanged.
