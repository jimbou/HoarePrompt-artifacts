Output State: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is at least 2, m is an integer, idx1 is i, idx2 is i.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`, effectively updating their values. The `break` statement exits the innermost loop or conditional statement, but since we are only considering the execution of the provided code snippet, the effect of the `break` statement is not observable in the output state. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
