Output State: **t is at least 2, m is an integer, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is an empty list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, idx1 is not less than idx2 and idx1 is less than or equal to idx2, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2.**

In this output state, the values of t, m, n, a1, a2, l11, l22, val, a3, l3, p1, p2, idx1, and idx2 remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The code only inserts a1 at index idx2 in l1 and assigns the modified l1 to l. Therefore, the final state includes the updated values of l1 and l.
