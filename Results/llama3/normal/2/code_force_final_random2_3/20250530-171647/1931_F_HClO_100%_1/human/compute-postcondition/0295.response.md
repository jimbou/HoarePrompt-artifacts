Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `idx1` is not -1, and `idx2` is `n-2`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `idx2`, which is now assigned the value of `n-2`. The value of `idx1` remains unchanged, as it was not -1 initially. The relationship between `i` and `n` remains the same, with `i` still equal to `n-1`.
