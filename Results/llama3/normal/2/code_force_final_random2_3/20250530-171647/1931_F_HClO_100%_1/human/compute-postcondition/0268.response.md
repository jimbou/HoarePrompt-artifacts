Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is greater than `i+1`, `m` is an integer, `i` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables maintain their initial values, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
