To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `val`, `a3`, and `l3`. The loop will execute if `val` has at least one tuple. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `val` to have at least one tuple, and `a3` and `l3` will be the first tuple in `val`.

State: **t is at least 2, m is 2, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list containing at least one tuple (a3, l3) and any previously appended tuples, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and idx2 is either -1 or n - 2. If idx1 is not less than idx2, then either l11 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, or l22 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, depending on whether l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2) or not. Additionally, if idx1 > idx2, then m is decreased by 1. Stdin is empty.**
