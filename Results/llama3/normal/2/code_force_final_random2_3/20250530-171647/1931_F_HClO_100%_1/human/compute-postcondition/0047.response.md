Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m` - 2, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is set to 1. In both cases, `i` remains at least 1.***
