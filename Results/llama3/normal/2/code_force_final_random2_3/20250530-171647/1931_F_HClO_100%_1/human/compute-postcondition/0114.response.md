Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is m - 2, m is an integer, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, a3 is the last a3 in the last tuple, l3 is the last l3 in the last tuple, idx1 is either -1, n - 2, or its original value, idx2 is either -1, n - 2, or its original value. If all l3 are equal to the list of elements in l excluding a3, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that all variables not affected by the loop remain unchanged. The loop iterates over all tuples in the list `val`. If any `l3` is not equal to the list of elements in `l` excluding `a3`, the loop breaks and 'no' is printed. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, 'yes' is printed. The final values of `a3` and `l3` are the last values from the last tuple in `val`.
