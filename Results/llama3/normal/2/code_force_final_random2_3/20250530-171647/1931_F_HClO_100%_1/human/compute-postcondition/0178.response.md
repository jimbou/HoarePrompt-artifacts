Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1. The current value of `idx1` is -1, and the current value of `idx2` is not -1, meaning `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`.***
