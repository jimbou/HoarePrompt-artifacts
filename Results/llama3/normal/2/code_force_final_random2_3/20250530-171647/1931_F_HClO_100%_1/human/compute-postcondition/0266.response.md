Postcondition: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is at least 2, m is an integer. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to l2[i + p2], then one of the following occurs: if l1[i + p1] is equal to a2 and l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, then idx1 is set to i and idx2 is set to i. If l1[i + p1] is equal to a2 but l2[i + p2] is not equal to a1, then p1 is set to 1, idx1 is set to i and no change occurs to p2 and idx2. If l1[i + p1] is not equal to a2 but l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, then p2 is set to 1, idx2 is set to i and no change occurs to p1 and idx1. If neither l1[i + p1] is equal to a2 nor l2[i + p2] is equal to a1, then p2 is set to 1, idx2 is set to i and no change occurs to p1 and idx1. If both idx1 and idx2 are greater than or equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If l1[i + p1] is equal to l2[i + p2], then no change occurs.**
