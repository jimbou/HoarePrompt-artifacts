Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is either -1 or the index where `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, `idx2` is either -1 or the index where `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2`, which may have been updated based on the values of `l1[i + p1]` and `l2[i + p2]` relative to `a1` and `a2`. The loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement when `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1` or when both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative.
