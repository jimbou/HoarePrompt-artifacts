The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m` - 2, `n` is greater than 3, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is at least 2**
