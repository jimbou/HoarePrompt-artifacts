Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m` - 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `stdin` contains `m` - 3 inputs: strings, `i` is 0. If `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. The current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the current value of `l2[i + p2]`.***
