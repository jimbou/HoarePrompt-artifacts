Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, and `i` is `i + 1` if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` does not equal `a1`, then `p1` is 1 and `idx1` is `i`. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `p2` is 1 and `idx2` is `i`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
