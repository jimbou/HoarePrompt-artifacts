Output State: **a1, a2, l11, l22, t, _, n, p1, p2, i, idx1, and idx2 retain their initial values. a3 is assigned the first integer from the input, and l3 is assigned the rest of the integers from the input. val is a list of tuples with the tuple (a3, l3) appended to it. m is decreased by 1. If the index of a1 in l3 is less than the index of a2 in l3, then l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is a list of integers equal to l1. Otherwise, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and l is a list of integers equal to l2.**

In this output state, the values of a1, a2, l11, l22, t, _, n, p1, p2, i, idx1, and idx2 remain unchanged from their initial values. The value of a3 is set to the first integer from the input, and the value of l3 is set to the rest of the integers from the input. The list val is updated by appending the tuple (a3, l3) to it. The value of m is decreased by 1. The lists l1 and l2 are updated based on the indices of a1 and a2 in l3, and the list l is set to either l1 or l2 depending on the comparison of these indices.
