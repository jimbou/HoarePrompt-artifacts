The code `continue` skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. The values of the variables are not affected. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers except the first three inputs which have been taken by `n`, `m` and `input()`. 'yes' is still being printed.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers, `m` is 1, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers except the first three inputs which have been taken by `n`, `m` and `input()`, and 'yes' is being printed, we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
