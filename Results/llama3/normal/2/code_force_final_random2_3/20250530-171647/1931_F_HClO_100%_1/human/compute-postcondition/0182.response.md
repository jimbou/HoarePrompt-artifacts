Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is `n - 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `idx2` has been updated to `n - 2`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the values of `idx1` and `idx2` are still valid, with `idx1` not being -1 and `idx2` being -1 in the previous state, but now `idx2` has been explicitly set to `n - 2`.
