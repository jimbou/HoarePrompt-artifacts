The code `input()` accepts a string from the input and does not assign it to any variable. The stdin contains one input: a string, which is consumed by the `input()` function. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 4, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, and stdin is empty.**
