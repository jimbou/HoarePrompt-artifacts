Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is either 0 or m - 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is either -1 or the index where l1[idx1] equals a2 and l2[idx1] equals a1, idx2 is either -1 or the index where l1[idx2] equals a2 and l2[idx2] equals a1, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `t`, `_`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged. The variables `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where `l1[idx1]` equals `a2` and `l2[idx1]` equals `a1`, or `l1[idx2]` equals `a2` and `l2[idx2]` equals `a1`, respectively. The variables `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, depending on whether `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, respectively.
