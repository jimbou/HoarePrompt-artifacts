According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `_` is 2, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `_` is 0 and `m` is at least 3.

State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3**
