Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m` - 2, `n` is greater than 3, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is at least 2. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is at least 2 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is at least 2 and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing.***
