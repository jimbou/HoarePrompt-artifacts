Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, m is 2, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list containing the tuple (a3, l3) and any previously appended tuples, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and idx2 is either -1 or n - 2. If idx1 is not less than idx2, then either l11 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, or l22 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, depending on whether l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2) or not. Additionally, if idx1 > idx2, then m is decreased by 1. Stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 2, m is either 1 or 2, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list containing at least one tuple (a3, l3) and any previously appended tuples, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and idx2 is either -1 or n - 2. If idx1 is not less than idx2, then either l11 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, or l22 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, depending on whether l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2) or not. Additionally, if idx1 > idx2, then m is decreased by 1. Stdin is empty. If the current value of l3 is equal to the list of integers in l excluding a3, then the program continues. Otherwise, 'no' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `m` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a4, l4)` and any previously appended tuples, `a4` is an integer, `l4` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` have specific conditions based on their values, `l` is a list of integers with specific insertions based on `idx1` and `idx2`, `l2` is a list of integers with specific insertions based on `idx1` and `idx2`, Stdin is empty. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `m` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing at least two tuples `(a4, l4)` and any previously appended tuples, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` have specific conditions based on their values, `l` is a list of integers with specific insertions based on `idx1` and `idx2`, `l2` is a list of integers with specific insertions based on `idx1` and `idx2`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state of the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
