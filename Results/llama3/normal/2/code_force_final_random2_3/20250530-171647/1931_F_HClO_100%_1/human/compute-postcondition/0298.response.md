Output State: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is an empty list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is equal to n-1, idx1 is less than idx2, and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at the position idx1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line inserts the value of `a2` at the position `idx1` in the list `l2`. This modifies the list `l2` by adding the element `a2` at the specified position. The second line assigns the modified list `l2` to a new variable `l`. 

After executing the code, all variables retain their initial values except for `l2`, which is modified by the insertion of `a2` at position `idx1`, and `l`, which is assigned the modified list `l2`. The relationship between `idx1` and `idx2` remains unchanged, with `idx1` being less than `idx2`.
