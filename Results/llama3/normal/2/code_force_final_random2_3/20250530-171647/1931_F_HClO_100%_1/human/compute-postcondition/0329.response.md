Postcondition: ***`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of an integer and a list of integers, `a3` is the first integer in the first tuple of `val`, `l3` is the first list of integers in the first tuple of `val`, `t` is at least 3, `_` is `m-2`, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is equal to `n-1`. If `l3` is equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
