Postcondition: **t is at least 2, m is an integer, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, idx1 is not less than idx2. If idx1 > idx2, then l11 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, m is decreased by 1, val is a list containing the tuple (a3, l3), and if l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2), then l11 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2. Otherwise, l22 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1.**
