Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is either 0 or m - 2, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, idx1 is i, idx2 is -1, p1 is 1, p2 is 0, stdin contains m - 3 inputs: strings, i is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`, updating `idx1` to be equal to `i`, which is 0. The second line assigns the value 1 to `p1`, updating `p1` to be 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
