To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `m`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 4, because the loop will execute `m - 2` times.

The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop execution. Its value is not relevant to the loop's continuation.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m`, which must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 1, `m` is at least 4, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3), `l3` is a list of integers, `idx1` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, `a3` is an integer, stdin contains no input**
