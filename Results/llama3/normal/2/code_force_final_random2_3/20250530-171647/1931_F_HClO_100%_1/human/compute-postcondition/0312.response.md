Output State: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is equal to n-1, idx1 is not less than idx2, and idx1 is less than or equal to idx2. The index of a1 in l3 is not less than the index of a2 in l3. l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and l is a list of integers equal to l2.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for `l2` and `l`. The value of `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at index `idx1`, and the value of `l` is assigned to be equal to the modified `l2`. The rest of the variables retain their original values and properties.
