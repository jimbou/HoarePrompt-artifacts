You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: t is at least 2, m is an integer, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, val is an empty list, a3 is the last a3 in the last tuple, l3 is the last l3 in the last tuple, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1. If m equals 1, 'yes' has been printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the values of m, n, a1, a2, l11, l22, p1, p2, val, a3, l3, idx1, and idx2 remain unchanged. a1 is the first integer from the first line of stdin, l1 is the rest of the integers from the first line of stdin, a2 is the first integer from the second line of stdin, l2 is the rest of the integers from the second line of stdin, l11 is a list of integers from l1 excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers from l2 excluding a1, stdin is empty. If l11 is not equal to l22, _ is m - 2, 'no' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.
```
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
