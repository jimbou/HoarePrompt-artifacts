Output State: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is an empty list, a3 is the first integer in the last tuple of the initial val, l3 is the first list of integers in the last tuple of the initial val, t is at least 3, _ is m-2, n is an integer, m is at least 3, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, and i is equal to n-1. If l3 is not equal to a list of integers excluding a3, then 'no' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'yes' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The loop has iterated over all tuples in the `val` list, and the final values of `a3` and `l3` are the first integer and list of integers in the last tuple of the initial `val`. If the condition in the if statement is not met, 'no' is printed, otherwise 'yes' is printed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
