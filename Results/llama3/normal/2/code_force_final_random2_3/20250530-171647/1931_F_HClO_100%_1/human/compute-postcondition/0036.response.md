Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m` - 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `idx1` is either `i` or -1, `idx2` is either `i` or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains `m` - 3 inputs: strings, `i` is 0. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is set to 1. The current values of `idx1` and `idx2` are both greater than or equal to 0.***
