The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i+1`.
State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is greater than `i+2`, `m` is an integer, `i` is increased by 1**
