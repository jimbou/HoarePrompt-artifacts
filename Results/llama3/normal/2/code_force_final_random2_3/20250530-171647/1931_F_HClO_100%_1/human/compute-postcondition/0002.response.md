Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers except the first two inputs which have been taken by `n` and `m`**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains at least 1, and the value of `_` remains 0. The code assigns the values of `n` and `m` to the first two integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers except the first two inputs which have been taken by `n` and `m`.
