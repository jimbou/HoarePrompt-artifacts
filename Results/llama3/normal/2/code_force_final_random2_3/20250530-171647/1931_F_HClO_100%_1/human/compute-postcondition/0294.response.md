Postcondition: ***`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is equal to `n-1`. The current value of `idx2` is -1 and the current value of `idx1` is not -1. If previously `idx1` was -1 and `idx2` was not -1, then the current value of `idx1` is `n-2` and `idx2` remains a value between 0 and `n-1`. Otherwise, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged.***
