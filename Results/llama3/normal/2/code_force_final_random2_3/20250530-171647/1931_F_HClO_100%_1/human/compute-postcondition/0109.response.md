To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `a3`, `l3`, and `val`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `val` list. If the list has at least 3 tuples, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `val` has at least 2 tuples, `a3` is the first `a3` in the second tuple, and `l3` is the first `l3` in the second tuple.

For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must have at least 3 tuples, and we need to move to the next tuple. Therefore, `a3` should be the first `a3` in the third tuple, and `l3` should be the first `l3` in the third tuple.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) that must have at least 3 tuples, `a3` is the first a3 in the third tuple, `l3` is the first l3 in the third tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value**
