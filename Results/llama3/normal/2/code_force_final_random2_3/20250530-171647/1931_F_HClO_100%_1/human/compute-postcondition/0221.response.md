Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a4, l4)` and any previously appended tuples, `a4` is an integer, `l4` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` have specific conditions based on their values, `l` is a list of integers with specific insertions based on `idx1` and `idx2`, `l2` is a list of integers with specific insertions based on `idx1` and `idx2`, Stdin is empty. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
