Output State: **t is at least 2, m is an integer that must be at least 2, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list containing the tuple (a3, l3) and any previously appended tuples, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1. If idx1 < idx2, then l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, and idx2 is either -1 or n - 2. If idx1 is not less than idx2, then either l11 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, or l22 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1 and l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, depending on whether l3.index(a1) is less than l3.index(a2) or not. Additionally, if idx1 > idx2, then m is decreased by 1. Stdin is empty.**

The code reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. It then appends the tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. The value of `m` is decreased by 1 if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The lists `l2` and `l` are updated based on the values of `idx1` and `idx2`. Stdin is now empty.
