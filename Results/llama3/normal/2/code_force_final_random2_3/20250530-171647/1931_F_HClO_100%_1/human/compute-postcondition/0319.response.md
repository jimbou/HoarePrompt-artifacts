To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`, which means we can only adjust the states of `_` and `m`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and `m`. If `_` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` is 1, and `m` remains the same.

State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing a tuple of an integer and a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is equal to `n-1`, `stdin` is empty**
