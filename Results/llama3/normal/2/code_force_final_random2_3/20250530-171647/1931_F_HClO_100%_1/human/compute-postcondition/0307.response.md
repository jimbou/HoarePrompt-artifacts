Postcondition: ***`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is an integer, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `m` is equal to 2, then `val` is a list containing the string 'yes' and 'yes' is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the values of `val` and other variables remain unchanged.***
