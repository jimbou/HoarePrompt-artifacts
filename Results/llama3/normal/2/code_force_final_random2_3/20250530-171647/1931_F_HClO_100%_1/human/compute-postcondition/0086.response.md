Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is either 0 or m - 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, idx1 is not less than idx2, idx1 is less than or equal to idx2, and l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1.**

The code modifies the list `l2` by inserting the value `a2` at index `idx1`, and assigns the modified list to the variable `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
