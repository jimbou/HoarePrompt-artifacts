Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m` - 2, `n` is greater than 3, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `i` is at least 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
