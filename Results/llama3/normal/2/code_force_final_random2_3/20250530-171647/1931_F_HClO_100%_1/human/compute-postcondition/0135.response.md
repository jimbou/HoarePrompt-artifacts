Output State: **t is at least 2, m is an integer, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0, p2 is 0, val is an empty list, a3 is the last a3 in the last tuple, l3 is the last l3 in the last tuple, idx1 is -1, idx2 is -1. If m equals 1, 'yes' has been printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the values of m, n, a1, a2, l11, l22, p1, p2, val, a3, l3, idx1, and idx2 remain unchanged. a1 is the first integer from the first line of stdin, l1 is the rest of the integers from the first line of stdin, a2 is the first integer from the second line of stdin, l2 is the rest of the integers from the second line of stdin, l11 is a list of integers from l1 excluding a2, l22 is a list of integers from l2 excluding a1, stdin is empty. If l11 is not equal to l22, _ is m - 2, 'no' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

The code snippet sets `idx1` and `idx2` to -1 and `p1` and `p2` to 0. The values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged. The conditions related to `m`, `l11`, and `l22` also remain unchanged.
