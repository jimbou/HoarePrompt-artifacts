Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is `n - 2`, and `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`.**

In this output state, the value of `idx1` has been updated to `n - 2`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `idx2` is still the index where `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, and the values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, `p1`, and `p2` are still the same as in the initial state.
