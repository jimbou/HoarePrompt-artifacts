The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is at least 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m` - 2, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` is either `i` or -1, `idx2` is either `i` or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`, then no change occurs. `i` is at least 1**
