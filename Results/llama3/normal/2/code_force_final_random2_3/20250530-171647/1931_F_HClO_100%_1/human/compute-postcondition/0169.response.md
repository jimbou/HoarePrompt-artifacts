Output State: **t is at least 2, m is an integer, n is at least i + 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is an empty list, a3 is the last a3 in the last tuple, l3 is the last l3 in the last tuple, i is i + 1, idx1 is i, p1 is 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `idx1` and sets `p1` to 1. The values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The condition `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1` is not relevant in this case as `p2` is not defined in the given code snippet.
