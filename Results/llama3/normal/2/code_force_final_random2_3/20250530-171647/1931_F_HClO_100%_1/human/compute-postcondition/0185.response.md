Output State: **t is at least 2, m is an integer, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is an empty list, a3 is the last a3 in the last tuple, l3 is the last l3 in the last tuple, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, idx1 is less than idx2, idx2 is either -1 or n - 2, l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1.**

The code inserts the value of `a2` at index `idx1` in the list `l2` and assigns the modified list to `l`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `idx2` is either -1 or `n - 2`, depending on the initial values of `idx1` and `idx2`. The list `l2` and the variable `l` now contain the value of `a2` at index `idx1`.
