Output State: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is greater than i+2, m is an integer, i is increased by 1, idx1 is i, idx2 is i.**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, or `i`. The `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement, but does not affect the values of any variables. The assignment of `idx1` and `idx2` to `i` simply assigns the current value of `i` to these variables, but does not change the value of `i` itself.
