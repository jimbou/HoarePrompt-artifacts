The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `m`. If `_` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be at least 4.
State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 4, stdin contains no input, and the program has accepted and discarded a line of input from the user.**
