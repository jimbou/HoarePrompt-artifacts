To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop variable, and `t`, which is the upper limit of the range.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `m - 2`, and `t` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes `m - 1`. The value of `t` remains the same, but since `t` is at least 1, it must be greater than the new value of `_` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is `m - 1`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value**
