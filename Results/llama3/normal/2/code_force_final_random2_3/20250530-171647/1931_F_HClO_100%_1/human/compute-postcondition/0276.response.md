Postcondition: ***`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is greater than `i+1`, `m` is an integer, `i` is increased by 1. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is the original value of `i` and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `a2`, then `idx2` is `i` and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.***
