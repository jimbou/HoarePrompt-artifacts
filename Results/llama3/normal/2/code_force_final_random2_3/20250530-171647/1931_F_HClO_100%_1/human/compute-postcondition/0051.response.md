Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m` - 2, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are updated according to the values of `l1[i + p1]`, `l2[i + p2]`, `a1`, and `a2`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
