Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `i`. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `p1` is set to 1, `idx1` is set to `i`, and `idx2` remains -1. Otherwise, `p2` is set to 1, `idx2` is set to `i`, and `idx1` remains -1. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both at least 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
