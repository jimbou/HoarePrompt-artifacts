Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `idx1` is either -1 or a value between 0 and `n-1`, `idx2` is either -1 or a value between 0 and `n-1`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `val` has been changed to an empty list, while the values of all other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
