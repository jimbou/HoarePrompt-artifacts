Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing at least two tuples `(a4, l4)` and any previously appended tuples, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` have specific conditions based on their values, `l` is a list of integers with specific insertions based on `idx1` and `idx2`, `l2` is a list of integers with specific insertions based on `idx1` and `idx2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a `break` statement, which means that the execution of the current loop or if statement is terminated. The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
