Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether there is a certain order that all screenshots correspond to. The program first checks if the number of screenshots is 1, in which case it prints "yes" because there is only one possible order. If the number of screenshots is greater than 1, it checks if the order of the participants in the first two screenshots is the same, excluding the authors of the screenshots. If the orders are not the same, it prints "no" because there is no possible order that both screenshots can correspond to. If the orders are the same, it checks if the authors of the screenshots are in the same position in the order. If they are not, it inserts the author of the first screenshot into the order of the second screenshot at the correct position, or vice versa. It then checks if the order of the participants in the remaining screenshots is the same as the order it has determined, excluding the authors of the screenshots. If any of the screenshots do not match the order, it prints "no". If all the screenshots match the order, it prints "yes".

Correctness: **True**
