Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list containing m-2 tuples of an integer and a list of integers, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, t is at least 3, _ is m-2, n is an integer, m is an integer, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, and i is equal to n-1, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of an integer and a list of integers, `a3` is the first integer in the first tuple of `val`, `l3` is the first list of integers in the first tuple of `val`, `t` is at least 3, `_` is `m-2`, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is equal to `n-1`. If `l3` is equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is terminated. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of an integer and a list of integers, `a3` is the first integer in the second tuple of `val`, `l3` is the first list of integers in the second tuple of `val`, `t` is at least 3, `_` is `m-2`, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is equal to `n-1`. If `l3` is equal to the list of integers excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples of an integer and a list of integers, `a3` is the first integer in the third tuple of `val`, `l3` is the first list of integers in the third tuple of `val`, `t` is at least 3, `_` is `m-2`, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is equal to `n-1`. If `l3` is not equal to a list of integers excluding `a3`, then 'no' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
