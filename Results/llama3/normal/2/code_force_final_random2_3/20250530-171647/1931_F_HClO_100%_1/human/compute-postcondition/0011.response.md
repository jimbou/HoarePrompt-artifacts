According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is at least 3. The variable `_` is also in the loop head, and its value will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `stdin` is empty**
