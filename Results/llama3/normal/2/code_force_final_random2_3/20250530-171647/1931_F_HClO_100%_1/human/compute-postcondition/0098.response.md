According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `val`. If `val` has at least 1 tuple containing (a3, l3) the loop executes. Before the loop starts, t is at least 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `val` is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) that must have at least 1 tuple and a3 is the first a3 in the first tuple and l3 is the first l3 in the first tuple.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) that must have at least 1 tuple, `a3` is the first a3 in the first tuple, `l3` is the first l3 in the first tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, `stdin` contains no input**
