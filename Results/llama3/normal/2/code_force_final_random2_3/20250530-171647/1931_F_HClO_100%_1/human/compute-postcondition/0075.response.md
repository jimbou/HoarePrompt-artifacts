Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is either 0 or m - 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is an empty list, l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, idx1 is not less than idx2 and the current value of idx1 is greater than the current value of idx2.**

The code modifies the list `l1` by inserting the value of `a1` at index `idx2`. This change is then reflected in the variable `l`, which is assigned the modified list `l1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
