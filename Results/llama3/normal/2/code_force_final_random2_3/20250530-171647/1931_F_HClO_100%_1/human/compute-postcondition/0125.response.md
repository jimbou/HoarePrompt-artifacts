The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than m - 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, m is at least 3. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again m must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `m` is at least 4, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, stdin contains one less input.**
