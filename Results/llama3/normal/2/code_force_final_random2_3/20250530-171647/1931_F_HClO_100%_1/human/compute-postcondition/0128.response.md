Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `m` is at least 4, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, stdin contains no input and we have read an input from stdin which is not assigned to any variable.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that an input has been read from stdin, but it is not assigned to any variable. All variables retain their original values and properties.
