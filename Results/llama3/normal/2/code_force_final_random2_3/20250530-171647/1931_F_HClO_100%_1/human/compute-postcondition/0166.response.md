Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside. The variables `t`, `m`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` retain their initial values, and `i` is still `i + 1`. The program execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.
