Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1. If `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged. `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `m` is 2, then we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the values of `m`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged. stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the values of `a3` and `l3` have been updated to be the first integer and the rest of the integers from the input, respectively. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
