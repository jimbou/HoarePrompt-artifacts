Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1. If `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is -1, then the current value of `idx2` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged. `idx1` is not less than `idx2` and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the `continue` statement only skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop, without changing any variable values.
