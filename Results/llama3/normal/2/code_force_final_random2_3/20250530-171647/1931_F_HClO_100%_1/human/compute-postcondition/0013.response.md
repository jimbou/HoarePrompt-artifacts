To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `m - 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `m` is at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 1. The value of `m` remains the same, but since `_` has increased, `m` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, and `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 4, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `stdin` is empty, and the program is waiting for user input.**
