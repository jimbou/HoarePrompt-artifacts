Postcondition: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is equal to `n-1`. If `idx1` is not -1 and `idx2` is -1, then `idx2` is updated to `n-2`. Otherwise, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, then `l` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`. Otherwise, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2` retain their initial values. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, then `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `l` is equal to `l1`. Otherwise, `a3` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `l3` is assigned the rest of the integers from the input. `val` is a list of tuples with the tuple (`a3`, `l3`) appended to it. `m` is decreased by 1. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l1`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list of integers with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `l` is a list of integers equal to `l2`.**
