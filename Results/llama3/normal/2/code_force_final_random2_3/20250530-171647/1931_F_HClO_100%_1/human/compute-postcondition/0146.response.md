Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, and `i` is 0. If `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. The current value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the current value of `l2[i + p2]`. Additionally, it is not the case that `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`. Furthermore, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`.***
