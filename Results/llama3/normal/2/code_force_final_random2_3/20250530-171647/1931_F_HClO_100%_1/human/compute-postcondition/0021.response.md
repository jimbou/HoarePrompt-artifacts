Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, _ is either 0 or m - 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, l1 is a list of integers, a2 is an integer, l2 is a list of integers, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers. If l11 is not equal to l22, then _ is set to m - 2, stdin contains m - 3 inputs: strings, and 'no' is being printed. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
