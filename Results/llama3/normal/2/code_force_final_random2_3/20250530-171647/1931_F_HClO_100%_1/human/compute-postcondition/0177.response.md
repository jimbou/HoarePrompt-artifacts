Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is either -1 or the index where `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, `idx2` is either -1 or the index where `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `val` is reassigned to an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
