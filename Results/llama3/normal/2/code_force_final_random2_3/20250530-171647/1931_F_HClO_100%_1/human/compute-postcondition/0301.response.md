Output State: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is an empty list, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, t is at least 3, _ is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is equal to n-1, idx1 is not less than idx2, and idx1 is greater than idx2, l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, and l is equal to l1.**

In this output state, the code has inserted the value of `a1` at index `idx2` in the list `l1`. The list `l1` is now modified to include the value of `a1` at the specified index. The variable `l` is assigned the value of `l1`, making it a reference to the modified list. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
