Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is at least 1, _ is either 0 or m - 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is either an empty list or a list of tuples containing (a3, l3), l3 is a list of integers, idx1 is either -1, n - 2, or its original value, idx2 is either -1, n - 2, or its original value. If idx1 < idx2, then l1 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1, l2 is a list of integers, and l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1. If idx1 >= idx2, then m is an integer equal to its original value minus 1. If idx1 > idx2, then l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l2 is a list of integers, and l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2. If idx1 <= idx2, then if l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2), l1 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2 and l2 is a list of integers, otherwise l1 is a list of integers and l2 is a list of integers with a2 inserted at index idx1. Additionally, l is a list of integers equal to l1 with a1 inserted at index idx2 if l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2), otherwise l is a list of integers equal to l2 with a2 inserted at index idx1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, _ is 0, m is at least 3, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3), l3 is a list of integers, idx1 is either -1, n - 2, or its original value, idx2 is either -1, n - 2, or its original value, a3 is an integer, stdin contains no input

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 1, _ is 1, m is at least 4, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3), l3 is a list of integers, idx1 is either -1, n - 2, or its original value, idx2 is either -1, n - 2, or its original value, a3 is an integer, stdin contains no input

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 1, _ is 2, m is at least 3, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, val is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3), l3 is a list of integers, idx1 is either -1, n - 2, or its original value, idx2 is either -1, n - 2, or its original value, a3 is an integer, stdin contains no input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
