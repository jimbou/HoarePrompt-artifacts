Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `m` is at least 4, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n` - 2, or its original value, stdin contains no input.**

The code `input()` consumes one input from stdin, but does not assign the input to any variable. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same, but stdin now contains no input.
