Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t` is at least 3, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, stdin contains one less input.**

The code `input()` accepts an input from the user, but it does not assign the input to any variable. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same. However, since an input has been accepted, the stdin now contains one less input.
