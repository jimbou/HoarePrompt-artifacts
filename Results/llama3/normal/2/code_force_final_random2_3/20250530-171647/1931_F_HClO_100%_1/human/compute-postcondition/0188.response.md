Output State: **t is at least 2, m is an integer, n is an integer, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2, l22 is a list of integers, val is an empty list, a3 is the last a3 in the last tuple, l3 is the last l3 in the last tuple, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, idx1 is not less than idx2, and idx1 is greater than idx2, l is a list of integers with a1 inserted at index idx2.**

In this output state, the value of `l11` has been modified by inserting `a1` at index `idx2`. The variable `l` has been assigned the modified list `l11`. All other variables remain unchanged.
