Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m` - 2, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `idx1` is either `i` or -1, `idx2` is either `i` or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
