To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables accordingly.


The loop head is `for (a3, l3) in val:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `a3`, `l3`, and `val`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `val` must have at least 1 tuple. For the loop to execute again, `val` must have at least 2 tuples.


Since `a3` and `l3` are the first elements of the first tuple in `val`, we need to move to the next tuple in `val` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `a3` and `l3` will be the elements of the second tuple in `val`.


The other variables (`t`, `_`, `m`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2`) are not in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.


State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list of tuples containing (a3, l3) that must have at least 2 tuples, `a3` is the first a3 in the second tuple, `l3` is the first l3 in the second tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value**
