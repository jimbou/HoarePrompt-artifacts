Output State: **a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, val is a list containing a tuple of an integer and a list of integers, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list of integers, t is at least 3, _ is 2, n is an integer, m is at least 4, p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, and i is equal to n-1, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the values from stdin to a3 and l3. Since stdin is empty, a3 and l3 will be assigned empty values. The second line appends a tuple containing a3 and l3 to the list val. 

The values of a1, a2, l11, l22, t, _, n, m, p1, p2, and i remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The value of val is updated by appending a new tuple containing a3 and l3. The value of a3 and l3 is updated to empty values as stdin is empty.
