Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is `m - 1`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the last `a3` in the last tuple, `l3` is the last `l3` in the last tuple, `idx1` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, `idx2` is either -1, `n - 2`, or its original value, `n` and `m` are assigned the values of two integers from the input.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables keep their original values and properties, except for `n` and `m`, which are now assigned the values of two integers from the input. The input is assumed to contain two integers separated by a space, which are read and assigned to `n` and `m` respectively.
