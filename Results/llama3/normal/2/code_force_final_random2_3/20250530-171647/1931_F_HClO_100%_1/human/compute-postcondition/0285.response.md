Output State: **`a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `val` is a list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `t` is at least 3, `_` is either 0 or 2, `n` is greater than `i+2`, `m` is an integer, `i` is increased by 1, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is equal to `i` and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is equal to `i` and `p2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the conditions and relationships between variables are still valid. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
