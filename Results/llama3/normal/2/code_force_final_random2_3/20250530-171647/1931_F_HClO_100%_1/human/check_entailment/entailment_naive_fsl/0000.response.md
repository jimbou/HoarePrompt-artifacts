Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when there are more than two screenshots and the order of participants is not consistent across all screenshots. 

For example, consider the case where n = 4, k = 3, and the screenshots are:

1 2 3 4
2 3 1 4
3 2 1 4

The program will incorrectly output "yes" because it only checks the consistency of the order between the first two screenshots and then checks the consistency of the order between the first screenshot and the remaining screenshots. However, it does not check the consistency of the order between the second and third screenshots, which is not consistent in this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
