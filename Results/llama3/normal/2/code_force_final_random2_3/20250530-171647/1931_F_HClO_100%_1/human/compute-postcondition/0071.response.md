Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is either 0 or `m - 2`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a1` is an integer, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is an integer, `l2` is a list of integers, `l11` is a list of integers, `l22` is a list of integers, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list. The current value of `idx1` is less than the current value of `idx2`. If `idx1` was initially -1 and `idx2` was not -1, then the current value of `idx1` is `n - 2` and the current value of `idx2` remains the index where `l1[idx2]` equals `a2` and `l2[idx2]` equals `a1`. Otherwise, if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, then the current value of `idx2` is `n - 2` and the current value of `idx1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged.**
