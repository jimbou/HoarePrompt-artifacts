Output State: **t is at least 2, m is an integer, n is at least i + 2, a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, l11 is a list of integers, l22 is a list of integers, p1 is 0 or 1, p2 is 1, val is an empty list, a3 is the last a3 in the last tuple, l3 is the last l3 in the last tuple, idx2 is i.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `p2` and introduces a new variable `idx2`. The value of `p2` is set to 1, and the value of `idx2` is set to the current value of `i`. No other variables are affected by the code. The conditions and relationships between variables specified in the initial state remain valid, as the code does not modify any of the other variables or their relationships.
