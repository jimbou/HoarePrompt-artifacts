Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer, `nalla` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` positive integers, `i` is less than 29, `length` is 30, the list `s` contains 30 elements, where each element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the corresponding position (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is True), otherwise they contain '0', except for the `i-th` element which is now '0', and the current value of `flag` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `x`, `nalla`, `length`, and `flag` remains the same. The value of `i` is still less than 29. The list `s` still contains 30 elements, but the `i-th` element is now '0', regardless of the value of `x`. The stdin still contains `t-3` positive integers.
