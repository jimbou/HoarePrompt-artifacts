Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is a positive integer, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` positive integers, `i` is 29, the list `s` contains 30 strings, each of which is either '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., `x` is a multiple of 2^i), or '0' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is 0, and `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer, length is 30, nalla is 0, stdin contains t-1 positive integers, i is 0, the list s contains 30 strings. If flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', then s[i] is '-1' and s[i + 1] is '1', and flag is 1. Otherwise, s[i] is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] was '0', otherwise s[i] remains unchanged. Additionally, either flag is 1, or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer, length is 30, nalla is 0, stdin contains t-1 positive integers, i is 1, the list s contains 30 strings. If flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', then s[i] is set to '-1' and flag is set to 1. Otherwise, if flag is 1 and s[i] was '0', then s[i] is set to '1'. Otherwise, s[i] remains unchanged. Additionally, either flag is 1, or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer, length is 30, nalla is 0, stdin contains t-1 positive integers, i is 2, and the list s contains 30 strings. If flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', then s[2] is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, the list s contains 29 strings. If flag is 1, then s[i] is '1'. Otherwise, s[i] remains unchanged, and either flag is 1, or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
