Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer, length is 30, nalla is 0, stdin contains t-1 positive integers, i is 0, the list s contains 30 strings, with s[i] being '1' if flag was 1 and s[i] was '0', otherwise s[i] remains unchanged, and the current value of flag is 0. The current value of s[i] is '1' and it is equal to s[i + 1].***
