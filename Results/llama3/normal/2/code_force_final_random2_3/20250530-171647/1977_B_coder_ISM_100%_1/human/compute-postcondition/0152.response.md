Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `nalla` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` positive integers, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is '1' (no change), the length of the list `s` which is 2 is being printed, and the elements of the list `s` are being printed. If the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is True), then `s` is a list containing two elements '1' and '0'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing two elements '0' and '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `t`, `x`, `nalla`, `i`, and `length` remains the same. The stdin still contains `t-5` positive integers. The value of `flag` is also unchanged. The list `s` now contains two elements, either '1' and '0' or '0' and '0', depending on whether the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i`. The length of the list `s` is now 2, and its elements are being printed.
