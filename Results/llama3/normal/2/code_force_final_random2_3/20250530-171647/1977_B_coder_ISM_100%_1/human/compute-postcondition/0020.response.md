Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is a positive integer, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` positive integers, `i` is 0, the list `s` contains 30 strings, each of which is either '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., `x` is a multiple of 2^i), or '0' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is 0, and the current value of `flag` is 1 and the current value of `s[i]` is '0'.**
