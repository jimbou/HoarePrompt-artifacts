Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `nalla` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` positive integers, `i` is less than 30, `length` is 30, the length of the list `s` is 30, and the elements of the list `s` are being printed. The list `s` contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of the integer `x`. The current value of `s[i]` is '0', regardless of the previous value of `s[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s[i]` is now '0', regardless of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `s` still contains 30 elements, each representing a binary digit of the integer `x`. The current value of `s[i]` is now '0', while the other elements of `s` remain the same.
