Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, nalla is 2, stdin contains t-5 positive integers, i is 30, s is an empty list, length is 30, flag is either 0 or s[29] is '1' (no change), the length of the list s which is 0 is being printed, and the elements of the list s which are none are being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `nalla` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` positive integers, `i` is 0, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is '1' (no change), the length of the list `s` which is 1 is being printed, and the elements of the list `s` are being printed. If the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is True), then `s` is a list containing a single element '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing a single element '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `nalla` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` positive integers, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is '1' (no change), the length of the list `s` which is 2 is being printed, and the elements of the list `s` are being printed. If the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is True), then `s` is a list containing two elements '1' and '1' if the bit at position `i` is '1', '1' and '0' if the bit at position `i` is '0' and the bit at position `i-1` is '1', otherwise `s` is a list containing two elements '0' and '1' if the bit at position `i-1` is '1', '0' and '0' if the bit at position `i-1` is '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `nalla` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` positive integers, `i` is 2, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is '1' (no change), the length of the list `s` which is 3 is being printed, and the elements of the list `s` are being printed. If the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is True), then `s` is a list containing three elements '1', '1', and '1' if the bit at position `i` is '1', '1', '1', and '0' if the bit at position `i` is '0' and the bit at position `i-1` is '1', otherwise `s` is a list containing three elements '1', '0', and '1' if the bit at position `i-1` is '1', '1', '0', and '0' if the bit at position `i-1` is '0'. If the current value of `x` does not have a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is False), then `s` is a list containing three elements '1', '1', and '0' if the bit at position `i` is '1', '1', '0', and '0' if the bit at position `i` is '0' and the bit at position `i-1` is '1', otherwise `s` is a list containing three elements '0', '1', and '0' if the bit at position `i-1` is '1', '0', '0', and '0' if the bit at position `i-1` is '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
