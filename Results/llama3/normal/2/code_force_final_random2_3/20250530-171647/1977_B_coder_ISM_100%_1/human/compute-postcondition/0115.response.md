Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer, nalla is 1, stdin contains t-3 positive integers, i is less than 30 and greater than or equal to 1, length is 30, the list s contains 30 elements, where each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the corresponding position (i.e., x & pow(2, i) is True), otherwise they contain '0', except for the ith element which is '0' regardless of the value of x.**

In this output state, the value of s[i] has been changed to '0', regardless of the previous value of x. The other variables remain unchanged.
