Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `nalla` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` positive integers, `i` is 30, `length` is 30, `flag` is 0, the length of the list `s` which is 30 is being printed, and the elements of the list `s` are being printed. The list `s` contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of the integer `x`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `nalla` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` positive integers, `i` is less than 29, `length` is 30, the length of the list `s` is 30, and the elements of the list `s` are being printed. The list `s` contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of the integer `x`. If `flag` is 0 and the current value of `s[i]` is '1' and the current value of `s[i]` is equal to the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then the current value of `s[i]` is '-1' and `flag` is 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, then the current value of `s[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, either `flag` is not 1, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, nalla is 2, stdin contains t-5 positive integers, i is less than 30, length is 30, the length of the list s is 30, and the elements of the list s are being printed. The list s contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of the integer x. If flag is 1 and the current value of s[i] is '0', then the current value of s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and the current value of s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then the current value of s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. If flag is 1 and the current value of s[i] is '1' and s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], then the current value of s[i] remains '1' and flag is 0. If flag is 0, then the current value of s[i] remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, nalla is 2, stdin contains t-5 positive integers, i is less than 30 and greater than or equal to 1, length is 30, the length of the list s is 30, and the elements of the list s are being printed. The list s contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of the integer x. If flag is 0 and the current value of s[i] is '1' and the current value of s[i + 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. If flag is 1 and the current value of s[i] is '0', then the current value of s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. Otherwise, the current value of s[i] remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
