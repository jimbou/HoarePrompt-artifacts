Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer, nalla is 1, stdin contains t-3 positive integers, i is 30, length is 30, the list s contains 30 elements, each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the corresponding position (i.e., x & pow(2, i) is True), otherwise it contains '0', flag is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer, nalla is 1, stdin contains t-3 positive integers, i is less than 29, length is 30, the list s contains 30 elements, where each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the corresponding position (i.e., x & pow(2, i) is True), otherwise they contain '0'. If flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1'. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then s[i] is '0'. If flag is 0, then either s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer, nalla is 1, stdin contains t-3 positive integers, i is less than 30, length is 30, the list s contains 30 elements, where each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the corresponding position (i.e., x & pow(2, i) is True), otherwise they contain '0'. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then the ith element of s is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, the values of s, flag, t, x, nalla, stdin, i, and length remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer, nalla is 1, stdin contains t-3 positive integers, i is less than 30 and greater than or equal to 1, length is 30. The list s contains 30 elements, where each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the corresponding position (i.e., x & pow(2, i) is True), otherwise they contain '0'. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '1', then the ith element of s is '-1' and flag is 1. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then the ith element of s is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, the values of s, flag, t, x, nalla, stdin, i, and length remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
