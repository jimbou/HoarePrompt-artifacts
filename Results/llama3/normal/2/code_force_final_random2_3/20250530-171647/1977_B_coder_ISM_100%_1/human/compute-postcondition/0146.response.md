Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `nalla` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` positive integers, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing a single element '1', `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is '1' (no change), the length of the list `s` which is 1 is being printed, and the elements of the list `s` which is '1' are being printed. The current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is True).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `x` is still equal to the first input from stdin, `nalla` is still 2, and stdin still contains `t-5` positive integers. The value of `i` is still 0, but the list `s` now contains a single element '1'. The length of the list `s` is now 1 and is being printed, and the element of the list `s` is '1' and is being printed. The current value of `x` still has a bit set at the position `i`.
