Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `nalla` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` positive integers, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty list, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is '1' (no change), the length of the list `s` which is 0 is being printed, and the elements of the list `s` which are none are being printed. Additionally, the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is 0***
