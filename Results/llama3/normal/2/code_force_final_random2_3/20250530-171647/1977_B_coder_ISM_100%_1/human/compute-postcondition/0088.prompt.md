Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer, nalla is 1, stdin contains t-3 positive integers, i is 31, length is 30, and the list s is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer, `nalla` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` positive integers, `i` is 0, `length` is 30. The list `s` contains one element, which is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is True), otherwise it contains '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer, `nalla` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` positive integers, `i` is 1, `length` is 30. The list `s` contains three elements, the first element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position 0 (i.e., `x` & pow(2, 0) is True), otherwise it contains '0', the second element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position 1 (i.e., `x` & pow(2, 1) is True), otherwise it contains '0'. The third element of `s` is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is True), otherwise it contains '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer, `nalla` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` positive integers, `i` is 2, `length` is 30. The list `s` contains four elements, the first element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position 0 (i.e., `x` & pow(2, 0) is True), otherwise it contains '0', the second element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position 1 (i.e., `x` & pow(2, 1) is True), otherwise it contains '0'. The third element of `s` is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is True), otherwise it contains '0'. The fourth element of `s` is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is True), otherwise it contains '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
