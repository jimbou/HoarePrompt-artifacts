Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer, length is 30, nalla is 0, stdin contains t-1 positive integers, i is 2, and the list s contains 29 strings. If flag is 1, then s[i] is '1'. Otherwise, s[i] remains unchanged, and either flag is 1, or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'.**
