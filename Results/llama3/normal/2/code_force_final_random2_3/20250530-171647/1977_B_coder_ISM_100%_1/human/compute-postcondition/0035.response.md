Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer, length is 30, nalla is 0, stdin contains t-1 positive integers, i is 1, the list s contains 30 strings with s[i] being '-1', flag is 1.**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `x` also remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The value of `length` remains 30 as it was not affected by the code. The value of `nalla` remains 0 as it was not modified by the code. The value of `stdin` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `i` remains 1 as it was not modified by the code. The list `s` now contains 30 strings with the string at index `i` being '-1' due to the first line of the code. The value of `flag` is now 1 due to the second line of the code.
