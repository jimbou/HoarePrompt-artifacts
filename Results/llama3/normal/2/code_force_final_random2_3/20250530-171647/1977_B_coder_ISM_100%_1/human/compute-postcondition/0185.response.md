Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, nalla is 2, stdin contains t-5 positive integers, i is less than 30 and greater than or equal to 1, length is 30, the length of the list s is 30, and the elements of the list s are being printed. The list s contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1', '-1', or '0', representing the binary representation of the integer x. The current value of s[i] is '0' regardless of the previous value of s[i].**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of s at index i is now '0', regardless of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
