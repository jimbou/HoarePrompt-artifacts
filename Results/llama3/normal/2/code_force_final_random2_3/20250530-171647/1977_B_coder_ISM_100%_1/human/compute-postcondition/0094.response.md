Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer, nalla is 1, stdin contains t-3 positive integers, i is less than 29, length is 30, the list s contains 30 elements, where each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the corresponding position (i.e., x & pow(2, i) is True), otherwise they contain '0', and flag is 0. The current value of flag is 0, the current value of s[i] is '1', and the current value of s[i + 1] is also '1'.**
