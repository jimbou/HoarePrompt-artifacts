Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer, nalla is 1, stdin contains t-3 positive integers, i is 1, length is at least 2, the list s contains either 30 or 31 elements. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then the value of s[i] is '0' and the value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, the values of s, flag, t, x, nalla, stdin, and length remain unchanged. Additionally, either flag is 0 or s[29] is '1'.***
