Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer, nalla is 0, stdin contains t-1 positive integers, i is 29, and the list s contains 30 strings. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', then s[29] is '1', length is 31, and s[30] is '1'. Otherwise, either flag is 0, or s[29] is not equal to '0'. If flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 1 and s[i] was '0', then s[i] is set to '1'. Otherwise, s[i] remains unchanged. Additionally, either flag is 1, or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'.***
