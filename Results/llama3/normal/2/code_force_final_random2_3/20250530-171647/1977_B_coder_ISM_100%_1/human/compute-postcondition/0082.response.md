Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer, `nalla` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` positive integers, `i` is 1, `length` is 30. The list `s` contains three elements, the first element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position 0 (i.e., `x` & pow(2, 0) is True), otherwise it contains '0', the second element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position 1 (i.e., `x` & pow(2, 1) is True), otherwise it contains '0'. The third element of `s` is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is True), otherwise it contains '0'.***
