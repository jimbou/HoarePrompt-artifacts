Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer, nalla is 0, stdin contains t-1 positive integers, i is 1, length is at least 2, s[i] is '0', s[i - 1] is '-1'**

The code snippet modifies the values of `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]`. Initially, `s[i]` was '-1' and `s[i - 1]` was '1'. After executing the code, `s[i]` becomes '0' and `s[i - 1]` becomes '-1'. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
