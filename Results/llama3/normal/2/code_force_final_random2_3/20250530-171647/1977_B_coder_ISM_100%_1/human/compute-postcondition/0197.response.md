To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `length`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `length` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `length`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `length` to be at least 2.

The state of `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement, but since it is the loop variable, we can infer that it should be initialized to 1, which is the starting value of the range.

The other variables mentioned in the problem statement, such as `flag`, `s`, and `t`, are not part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`length` is at least 2, `i` is 1**
