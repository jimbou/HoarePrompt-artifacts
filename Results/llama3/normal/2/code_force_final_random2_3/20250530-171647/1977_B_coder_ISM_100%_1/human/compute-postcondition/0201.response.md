To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `length`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `length`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `length` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `length` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `length` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`length` is at least 3, `i` is 2**
