Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer, nalla is 1, stdin contains t-3 positive integers, i is 29, length is 31, the list s contains 31 elements, where the first 29 elements are the same as before, the 30th element is '0', and the 31st element is '1', flag is 0. Otherwise, the values of s, flag, t, x, nalla, stdin, i, and length remain unchanged. Additionally, either flag is 0 or s[29] is '1'.***
