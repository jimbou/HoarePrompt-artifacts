Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer, nalla is 1, stdin contains t-3 positive integers, i is 30, length is 30, the list s contains 30 elements, each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the corresponding position (i.e., x & pow(2, i) is True), otherwise it contains '0', flag is 0.**

In this output state, the value of flag has been updated to 0, and all other variables remain unchanged. The list s still contains 30 elements, each representing the bit set at the corresponding position in the value of x. The stdin still contains t-3 positive integers.
