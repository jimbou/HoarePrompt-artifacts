The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since stdin contains `t` positive integers, after this line, stdin contains `t-1` positive integers. The second line initializes an empty list `s`. The third line assigns the value 30 to `length`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer, s is an empty list, length is 30, nalla is 0, stdin contains t-1 positive integers**
