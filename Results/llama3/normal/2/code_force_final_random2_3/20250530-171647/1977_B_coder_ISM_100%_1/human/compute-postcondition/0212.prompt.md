Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` positive integers `x` (1 <= x < 2^30)
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer, nalla is 0, stdin contains t-1 positive integers, i is 31, length is 31, and the list s contains 31 strings. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then s[i] is set to '0' and s[i - 1] is set to '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to s[i] and s[i - 1]., the list s which contains 31 strings is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer, nalla is 1, stdin contains t-3 positive integers, i is 30, the list s contains either 30 or 31 elements. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then the value of s[i] is '0' and the value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, the values of s, flag, t, x, nalla, stdin, and length remain unchanged. Additionally, either flag is 0 or s[29] is '1', and the length of the list s which is either 30 or 31 is being printed, and the elements of the list s are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program state is t. If the flag is true and the 30th character of s is '0', then the program state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the flag is true and the 30th character of s is '1', then the 31st character of s is '1' and the length is increased by 1. If the flag is false, then the program state remains unchanged regardless of the value of the 30th character of s, and the length is printed, and the string s is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
