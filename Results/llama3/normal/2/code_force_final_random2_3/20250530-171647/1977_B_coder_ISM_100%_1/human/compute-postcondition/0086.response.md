Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer, `nalla` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` positive integers, `i` is 2, `length` is 30. The list `s` contains four elements, the first element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position 0 (i.e., `x` & pow(2, 0) is True), otherwise it contains '0', the second element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position 1 (i.e., `x` & pow(2, 1) is True), otherwise it contains '0'. The third element of `s` is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is True), otherwise it contains '0'. The fourth element of `s` is '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `s` now contains four elements instead of three. The first three elements of `s` are determined by the bits of the integer `x`, and the fourth element is always '0'.
