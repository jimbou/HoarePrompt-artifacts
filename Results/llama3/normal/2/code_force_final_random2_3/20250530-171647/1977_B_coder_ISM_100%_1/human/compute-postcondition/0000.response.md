The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` positive integers `x` (1 <= x < 2^30). Since `t` is assigned the first integer from the input, the remaining input in stdin will be `t` positive integers `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` positive integers `x` (1 <= x < 2^30)**
