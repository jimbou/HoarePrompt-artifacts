Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer, nalla is 0, stdin contains t-1 positive integers, i is 31, length is 31, and the list s contains 31 strings. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then s[i] is set to '0' and s[i - 1] is set to '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to s[i] and s[i - 1]., the list s which contains 31 strings is being printed**
