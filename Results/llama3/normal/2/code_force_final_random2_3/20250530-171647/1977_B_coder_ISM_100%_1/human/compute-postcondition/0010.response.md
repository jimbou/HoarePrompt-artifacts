Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is a positive integer, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` positive integers, `i` is 1, 30 is greater than 1, and the list `s` contains either the string '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., `x` is a multiple of 2^i), or the string '0' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is 0, and an additional '1' is appended to the list `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `s` now has an additional element '1' appended to it. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
