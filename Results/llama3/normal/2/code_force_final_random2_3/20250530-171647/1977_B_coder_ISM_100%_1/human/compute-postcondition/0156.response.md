Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `nalla` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` positive integers, `i` is 2, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is '1' (no change), the length of the list `s` which is 3 is being printed, and the elements of the list `s` are being printed. If the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., `x` & pow(2, i) is True), then `s` is a list containing three elements '1', '1', and '0' if the bit at position `i` is '1', '1', '0', and '0' if the bit at position `i` is '0' and the bit at position `i-1` is '1', otherwise `s` is a list containing three elements '0', '1', and '0' if the bit at position `i-1` is '1', '0', '0', and '0' if the bit at position `i-1` is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by appending '0' to the list. The length of `s` is now 3, and its elements are being printed. The other variables remain unchanged.
