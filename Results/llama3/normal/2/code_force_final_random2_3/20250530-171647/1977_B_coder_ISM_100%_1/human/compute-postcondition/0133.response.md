Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer, nalla is 1, stdin contains t-3 positive integers, i is 2, length is at least 3, the list s contains either 30 or 31 elements. If s[2] is '-1' and s[1] is '1', then s[2] is '0' and s[1] is '-1'. If flag is 0, then s[29] is '1'. Otherwise, the values of s, flag, t, x, nalla, stdin, and length remain unchanged.***
