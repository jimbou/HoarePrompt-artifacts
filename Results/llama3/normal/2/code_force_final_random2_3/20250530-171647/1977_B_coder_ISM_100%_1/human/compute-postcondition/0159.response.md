Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `nalla` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` positive integers, `i` is 30, `length` is 30, `flag` is 0, the length of the list `s` which is 30 is being printed, and the elements of the list `s` are being printed. The list `s` contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of the integer `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `flag` has been updated to 0, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The length and elements of the list `s` are still being printed, and the stdin still contains `t-5` positive integers.
