Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer, `nalla` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` positive integers, `i` is 1, `length` is 30. The list `s` contains three elements, the first element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position 0 (i.e., `x` & pow(2, 0) is True), otherwise it contains '0', the second element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position 1 (i.e., `x` & pow(2, 1) is True), otherwise it contains '0', the third element is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by appending '0' to the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `s` now contains three elements, where the first two elements represent the bits at positions 0 and 1 of the current value of `x`, and the third element is always '0'.
