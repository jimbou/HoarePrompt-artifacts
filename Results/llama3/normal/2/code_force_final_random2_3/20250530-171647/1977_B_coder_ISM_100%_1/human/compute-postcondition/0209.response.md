Output: **The program state is t. If the flag is true and the 30th character of s is '0', then the program state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the flag is true and the 30th character of s is '1', then the 31st character of s is '1' and the length is increased by 1. If the flag is false, then the program state remains unchanged regardless of the value of the 30th character of s, and the length is printed**
