Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is a positive integer, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` positive integers, `i` is 2, 30 is greater than 2, and the list `s` contains either the string '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the position `i` (i.e., `x` is a multiple of 2^i), or the string '0' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is 0. Depending on whether `x` is a multiple of 2^i or not, an additional '1' or '0' is appended to the list `s`.***
