Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is an integer, `nalla` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` positive integers, `i` is less than 30, `length` is 30, the list `s` contains 30 elements, where each element is '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at the corresponding position (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is True), otherwise they contain '0', except for the `i-th` element which is now '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is still an integer, `nalla` is still 1, there are still `t-3` positive integers in stdin, `i` is still less than 30, and `length` is still 30. The list `s` still contains 30 elements, but the `i-th` element is now '0', regardless of the value of `x`. The other elements of `s` still depend on the bits of `x`.
