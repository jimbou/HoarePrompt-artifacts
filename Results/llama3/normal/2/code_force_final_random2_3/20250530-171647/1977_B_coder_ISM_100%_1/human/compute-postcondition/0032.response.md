The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 29, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer, length is 30, nalla is 0, stdin contains t-1 positive integers, i is 1, the list s contains 30 strings. If flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', then s[i] is '-1' and s[i + 1] is '1', and flag is 1. Otherwise, s[i] is '1' if flag is 1 and s[i] was '0', otherwise s[i] remains unchanged. Additionally, either flag is 1, or s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'.**
