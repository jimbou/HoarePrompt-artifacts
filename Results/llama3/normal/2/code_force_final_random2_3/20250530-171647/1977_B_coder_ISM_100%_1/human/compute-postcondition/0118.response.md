Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), x is an integer, nalla is 1, stdin contains t-3 positive integers, i is less than 30 and greater than or equal to 1, length is 30. The list s contains 30 elements, where each element is '1' if the current value of x has a bit set at the corresponding position (i.e., x & pow(2, i) is True), otherwise they contain '0'. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '1', then the ith element of s is '-1' and flag is 1. If flag is 0 and s[i] is '1' and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], then the ith element of s is '-1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, the values of s, flag, t, x, nalla, stdin, i, and length remain unchanged.**
