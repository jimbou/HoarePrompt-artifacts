Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` only considers the first element of the sequence `a` and the number of players `b`, but it does not take into account the rest of the sequence `a` or the fact that players are removed from the game in each round.

For example, consider the test case where `a = [3, 5]` and `b = 5`. The program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `2` because players `C` and `E` are removed in the first round, and player `D` is removed in the second round, leaving players `A` and `B` as the winners.

The program does not correctly simulate the game logic and does not consider all the elements of the sequence `a` and the number of players `b`. Therefore, it is incorrect.
