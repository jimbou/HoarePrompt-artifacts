Reasoning: 
The provided functions do not match the problem description. The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided functions seem to be related to traversing a path and finding the maximum value, which is not relevant to the problem.

Function 1 calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing a path from the beginning to the end, where '*' represents an obstacle and '@' represents a valid path. This function does not take into account the periodicities of the signs or the year in which the signs will occur.

Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. However, it calls Function 1, which is not relevant to the problem.

Therefore, the provided functions do not meet the problem description, and the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
