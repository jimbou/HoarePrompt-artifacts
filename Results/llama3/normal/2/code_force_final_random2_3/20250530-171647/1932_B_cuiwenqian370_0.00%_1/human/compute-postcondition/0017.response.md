Output State: **data is an empty list, t is at least 1, index is 2*t+1, results is an empty list, stdin is empty, and all elements of the results list have been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the list `data` is still empty, the variable `t` is at least 1, the variable `index` is still 2*t+1, the list `results` is now empty because all its elements have been processed and printed, and the standard input `stdin` is still empty.
