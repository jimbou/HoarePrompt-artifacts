To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than the current iteration number, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than the current iteration number. Since the loop has already executed once, the current iteration number is 1. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 1.

However, since `_` is a throwaway variable, its state does not affect the execution of the loop.

The other variables `data`, `index`, `results`, and `stdin` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`data` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `index` is 5, `results` is a list containing two elements which are the return values of `func_1(path)` for two different paths, `stdin` is empty**
