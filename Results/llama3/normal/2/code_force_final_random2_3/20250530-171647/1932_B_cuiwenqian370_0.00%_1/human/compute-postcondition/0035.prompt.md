You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*'.
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns the number 0.
    #State: *`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, and `n` is larger than 0
    dp = [0] * n

        #State: *`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 0, `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first number is -float('inf') and the rest are zeros, the first character of `path` is '*', and the current value of the first character of `path` is '*'
    #State: *`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 0. If the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0. If the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first number is -float('inf') and the rest are zeros.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: *`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 1. If the first character of `path` is '@', then the current value of `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0. If the first character of `path` is '*', then the current value of `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first number is -float('inf') and the rest are zeros. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf'). If the second character of `path` is '@', then `dp[1]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@' else `dp[1]` is 1. If the second character of `path` is not '*' and the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is 0.
    #State: *`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 0. If `n` is 1, then the value of `dp` is determined by the first character of `path`. If the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0. If the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first number is -float('inf') and the rest are zeros. If `n` is larger than 1, then the value of `dp` is determined by the first two characters of `path`. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf'). If the second character of `path` is '@', then `dp[1]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@' else `dp[1]` is 1. If the second character of `path` is not '*' and the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is 0.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 0, `i` is `n`, `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the value of each number is determined by the corresponding character in `path`. If the character at index `i` of `path` is '*', the number at index `i` in `dp` is negative infinity. Otherwise, the character at index `i` of `path` is '@', and the value of `dp[i]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity, which represents the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing the path from the beginning to the end, where '*' represents an obstacle and '@' represents a valid path, and the value at each position is the maximum of the values at the previous two positions plus 1, or negative infinity if the character at that position is '*'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the number 0.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value in the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity, which represents the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing the path from the beginning to the end, where '*' represents an obstacle and '@' represents a valid path, and the value at each position is the maximum of the values at the previous two positions plus 1, or negative infinity if the character at that position is '*'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
