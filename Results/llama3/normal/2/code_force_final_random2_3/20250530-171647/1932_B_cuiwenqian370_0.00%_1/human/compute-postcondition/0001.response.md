To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to worry about its state. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`data` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty**
