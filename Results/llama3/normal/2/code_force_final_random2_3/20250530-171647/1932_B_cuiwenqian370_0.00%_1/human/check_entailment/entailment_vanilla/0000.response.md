Reasoning:

The provided program is not correct for the given problem. The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided program is implementing a different logic.

The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The `func_1` function seems to be implementing a dynamic programming approach to solve a different problem, where it's trying to find the maximum value in a sequence based on certain conditions. The `func_2` function is reading input from the standard input and calling the `func_1` function with a string input.

However, the problem requires a different approach. The correct approach would be to iterate over the periodicities of the signs and calculate the year in which each sign will occur. The year in which the i-th sign will occur can be calculated by finding the smallest multiple of the periodicity of the i-th sign that is greater than the year in which the (i-1)-th sign occurred.

Here is a correct implementation of the problem:

```python
def apocalypse_year():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        signs = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        year = 0
        for sign in signs:
            year = (year // sign + 1) * sign
        results.append(year)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

apocalypse_year()
```

Correctness: **False**
