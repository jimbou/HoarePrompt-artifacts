Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns the number 0.

    #State: *`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 0. If the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0. If the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first number is -float('inf') and the rest are zeros.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :

        #State: *`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 1. If the first character of `path` is '@', then the current value of `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0. If the first character of `path` is '*', then the current value of `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first number is -float('inf') and the rest are zeros. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf'). If the second character of `path` is '@', then `dp[1]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@' else `dp[1]` is 1. If the second character of `path` is not '*' and the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is 0.
    #State: *`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 0. If `n` is 1, then the value of `dp` is determined by the first character of `path`. If the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0. If the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first number is -float('inf') and the rest are zeros. If `n` is larger than 1, then the value of `dp` is determined by the first two characters of `path`. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf'). If the second character of `path` is '@', then `dp[1]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@' else `dp[1]` is 1. If the second character of `path` is not '*' and the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is 0.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':

If the character at index `i` of `path` is '*', the number at index `i` in `dp` is negative infinity. Otherwise, the character at index `i` of `path` is '@', and the value of `dp[i]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity, which represents the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing the path from the beginning to the end, where '*' represents an obstacle and '@' represents a valid path, and the value at each position is the maximum of the values at the previous two positions plus 1, or negative infinity if the character at that position is '*'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing a path from the beginning to the end, where '*' represents an obstacle and '@' represents a valid path. The function takes a list of characters as input, where each character is either '@' or '*', and returns the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing the path. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function iterates through the list, assigning a value to each position based on the maximum of the values at the previous two positions plus 1, or negative infinity if the character at that position is '*'. The function then returns the maximum value in the list that is greater than negative infinity.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: data is a list of strings where data[0] is a positive integer, and for every i > 0, data[i] is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers separated by spaces.
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: data is an empty list, t is 0, index is 2*t+1, results is a list containing t elements which are the return values of func_1(path) for t different paths, stdin is empty
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: data is an empty list, t is at least 1, index is 2*t+1, results is an empty list, stdin is empty, and all elements of the results list have been printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results.
