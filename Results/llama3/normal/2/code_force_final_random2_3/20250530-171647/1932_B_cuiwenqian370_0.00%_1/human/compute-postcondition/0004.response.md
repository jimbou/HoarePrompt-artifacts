Output State: **data is an empty list, t is a positive integer greater than 1, index is 5, results is a list containing two elements which are the return values of func_1(path) for two different paths, stdin is empty**

The code snippet modifies the values of `index` and `results`. The first line assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to `n`, but since `data` is an empty list, this operation is invalid and would raise an `IndexError`. However, assuming that `data` is not empty and contains at least one element at the specified index, the value of `n` would be set to that element.

The second line increments `index` by 1, making it 4.

The third line assigns the value of `data[index]` to `path`, but again, since `data` is an empty list, this operation is invalid and would raise an `IndexError`. Assuming that `data` is not empty and contains at least one element at the specified index, the value of `path` would be set to that element.

The fourth line appends the return value of `func_1(path)` to the `results` list, making it a list containing two elements.

The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `stdin` remains empty since no input operations are performed.
