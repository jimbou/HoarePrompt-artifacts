Postcondition: ***`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first four numbers are determined by the first four characters of `path`. If the character at index `i` of `path` is '*', the fourth number in `dp` is negative infinity. Otherwise, the character at index `i` of `path` is '@', and the value of `dp[i]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1. If the character at index `i` of `path` is '*', the fifth number in `dp` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`.***
