Output State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first three numbers are determined by the first three characters of `path`. The fourth number in `dp` is negative infinity.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i]` has been updated to negative infinity, which means that the fourth number in the `dp` list is now negative infinity. The other variables remain unchanged, with `path` still being a list of characters, `n` being at least 4, and `i` being 4. The first three numbers in the `dp` list are still determined by the first three characters of `path`.
