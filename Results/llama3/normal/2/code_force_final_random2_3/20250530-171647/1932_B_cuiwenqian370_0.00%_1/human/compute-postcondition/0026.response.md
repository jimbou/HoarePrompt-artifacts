Output State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first three numbers are determined by the first three characters of `path`. The value of `dp[i]` is negative infinity.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i]` has been updated to negative infinity, while the other variables remain unchanged. The first three numbers in `dp` are still determined by the first three characters of `path`, but the value at index `i` (which is 3) is now negative infinity.
