This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing a path from the beginning to the end, where '*' represents an obstacle and '@' represents a valid path. The function takes a list of characters as input, where each character is either '@' or '*', and returns the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing the path. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function iterates through the list, assigning a value to each position based on the maximum of the values at the previous two positions plus 1, or negative infinity if the character at that position is '*'. The function then returns the maximum value in the list that is greater than negative infinity.
