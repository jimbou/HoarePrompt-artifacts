Functionality: **Reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results.**

Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

*   Reads input from standard input until it is empty.
*   Processes the input data by splitting it into a list of strings.
*   Extracts the first element of the list as a positive integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
*   Iterates `t` times, processing each test case as follows:
    *   Extracts the next two elements of the list as a positive integer `n` and a string `path`.
    *   Calls a function `func_1` with the `path` as an argument and appends the result to a list `results`.
*   Prints each element of the `results` list.
*   Leaves the input data, results, and standard input in an empty state after processing and printing all test cases.
