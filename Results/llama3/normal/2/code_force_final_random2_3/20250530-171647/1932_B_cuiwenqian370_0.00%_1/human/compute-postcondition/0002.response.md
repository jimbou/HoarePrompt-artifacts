Output State: **data is an empty list, t is a positive integer greater than 0, index is 3, results is a list containing one element which is the return value of func_1(path), stdin is empty**

The code block modifies the state of the program by executing four lines of code. The first line assigns the integer value of the element at index 1 in the data list to the variable n. Since the data list is empty, this line will raise an IndexError. The second line increments the index variable by 1, making it 2. The third line assigns the value of the element at index 2 in the data list to the variable path. Again, since the data list is empty, this line will also raise an IndexError. The fourth line appends the return value of the function func_1(path) to the results list. However, since the path variable is not defined due to the previous IndexError, this line will also raise a NameError.

Therefore, the final state of the program is that the data list remains empty, the t variable remains unchanged, the index variable is incremented to 3, the results list contains one element which is the return value of func_1(path), and the stdin remains empty.
