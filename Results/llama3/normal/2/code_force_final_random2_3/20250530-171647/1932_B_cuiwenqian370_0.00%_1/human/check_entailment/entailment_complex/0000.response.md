Reasoning: 

The given program is supposed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided functions do not seem to be related to this problem.

Function 1 appears to be a solution to a different problem, where it calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing a path from the beginning to the end, where '*' represents an obstacle and '@' represents a valid path.

Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. However, it calls Function 1, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

Therefore, the given program does not meet the problem description, and the correctness is False.

Correctness: **False**
