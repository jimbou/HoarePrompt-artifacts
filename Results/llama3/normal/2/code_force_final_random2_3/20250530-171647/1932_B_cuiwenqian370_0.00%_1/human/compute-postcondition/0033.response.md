Output State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 0, `i` is `n`, `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the value of each number is determined by the corresponding character in `path`. If the character at index `i` of `path` is '*', the number at index `i` in `dp` is negative infinity. Otherwise, the character at index `i` of `path` is '@', and the value of `dp[i]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `path` and `n` remain unchanged, `i` is now equal to `n`, and `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where each number is determined by the corresponding character in `path`. If a character in `path` is '*', the corresponding number in `dp` is negative infinity. If a character in `path` is '@', the corresponding number in `dp` is the maximum of the previous two numbers in `dp` plus 1.
