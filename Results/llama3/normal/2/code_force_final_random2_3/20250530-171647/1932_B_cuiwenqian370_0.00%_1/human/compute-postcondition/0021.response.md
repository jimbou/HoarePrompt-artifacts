The value of `dp[i]` is assigned the value of negative infinity, where `i` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first two numbers are determined by the first two characters of `path` and the third number is negative infinity.
