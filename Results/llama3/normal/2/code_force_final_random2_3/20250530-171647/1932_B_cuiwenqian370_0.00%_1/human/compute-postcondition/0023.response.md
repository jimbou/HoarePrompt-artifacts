Output State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first three numbers are determined by the first three characters of `path`, and the character at index `i` of `path` is '@'. The value of `dp[i]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i]` has been updated based on the character at index `i` of `path`, which is '@'. The maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` is calculated and then 1 is added to it because the character at index `i` is '@'. The values of the other variables remain the same.
