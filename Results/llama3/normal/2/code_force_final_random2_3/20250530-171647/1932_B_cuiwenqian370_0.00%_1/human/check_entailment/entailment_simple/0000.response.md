Reasoning: 

The given program does not match the problem description. The problem description asks to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided program appears to be solving a different problem, where it calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing a path from the beginning to the end, where '*' represents an obstacle and '@' represents a valid path.

The program does not take into account the periodicities of the signs, and it does not calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
