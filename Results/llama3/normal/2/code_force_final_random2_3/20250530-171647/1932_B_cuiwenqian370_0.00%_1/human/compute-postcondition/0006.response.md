Output State: **data is an empty list, t is a positive integer greater than 1, index is 7, results is a list containing three elements which are the return values of func_1(path) for three different paths, stdin is empty**

The code block modifies the state of the variables as follows:

- The first line assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to `n`. Since `data` is an empty list, this line does not affect any variables.
- The second line increments `index` by 1, making `index` equal to 6.
- The third line assigns the value of `data[index]` to `path`. Since `data` is an empty list, this line does not affect any variables.
- The fourth line appends the return value of `func_1(path)` to `results`. Since `path` is not defined, this line does not affect any variables.

Therefore, the final state of the variables is:

- `data` is an empty list
- `t` is a positive integer greater than 1 (no change)
- `index` is 7 (incremented by 2)
- `results` is a list containing three elements which are the return values of `func_1(path)` for three different paths (one element appended)
- `stdin` is empty (no change)
