Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description asks to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided program seems to be solving a different problem, which is to find the maximum number of '@' characters in a path.

The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but neither of them seems to be related to the problem description. The `func_1` function appears to be solving a dynamic programming problem, but it's not clear what the problem is. The `func_2` function reads input from the standard input, but it's not clear what the input is supposed to represent.

To solve the problem described, we would need a program that takes the periodicities of the signs as input and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur. The program would need to iterate over the periodicities, adding the current periodicity to the current year, and then updating the current year to be the next multiple of the current periodicity.

For example, a correct program might look like this:
```
def apocalypse_year(signs):
    year = 0
    for sign in signs:
        year += sign - (year % sign)
    return year

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    signs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(apocalypse_year(signs))
```
This program reads the number of test cases, the number of signs, and the periodicities of the signs, and then calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur using the `apocalypse_year` function.
