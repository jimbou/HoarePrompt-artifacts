Output State: **data is an empty list, t is 0, index is 2*t+1, results is a list containing t elements which are the return values of func_1(path) for t different paths, stdin is empty**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the data list remains empty, the value of t becomes 0, the index becomes 2 times the initial value of t plus 1, the results list contains t elements which are the return values of func_1(path) for t different paths, and the stdin remains empty.
