Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 0. If `n` is 1, then the value of `dp` is determined by the first character of `path`. If the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp` is a list of `n` integers where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are 0. If the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first number is -float('inf') and the rest are zeros. If `n` is larger than 1, then the value of `dp` is determined by the first two characters of `path`. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf'). If the second character of `path` is '@', then `dp[1]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@' else `dp[1]` is 1. If the second character of `path` is not '*' and the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2, n):
    if path[i] == '*':
        dp[i] = -float('inf')
    else:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first two numbers are determined by the first two characters of `path`. If the character at index `i` of `path` is '*', the third number in `dp` is negative infinity. Otherwise, the character at index `i` of `path` is '@', and the value of `dp[i]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first four numbers are determined by the first four characters of `path`. If the character at index `i` of `path` is '*', the fourth number in `dp` is negative infinity. Otherwise, the character at index `i` of `path` is '@', and the value of `dp[i]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first four numbers are determined by the first four characters of `path`. If the character at index `i` of `path` is '*', the fourth number in `dp` is negative infinity. Otherwise, the character at index `i` of `path` is '@', and the value of `dp[i]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1. If the character at index `i` of `path` is '*', the fifth number in `dp` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
