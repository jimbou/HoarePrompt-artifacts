The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first four numbers are determined by the first four characters of `path`. If the character at index `i` of `path` is '*', the fourth number in `dp` is negative infinity. Otherwise, the character at index `i` of `path` is '@', and the value of `dp[i]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1.**
