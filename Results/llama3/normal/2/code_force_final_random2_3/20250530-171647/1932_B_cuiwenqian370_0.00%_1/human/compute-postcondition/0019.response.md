According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is larger than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and `i` is now 2. 
State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first two numbers are determined by the first two characters of `path`**
