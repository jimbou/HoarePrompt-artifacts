Output State: **The program returns the maximum value in the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity, which represents the maximum value that can be obtained by traversing the path from the beginning to the end, where '*' represents an obstacle and '@' represents a valid path, and the value at each position is the maximum of the values at the previous two positions plus 1, or negative infinity if the character at that position is '*'.**
