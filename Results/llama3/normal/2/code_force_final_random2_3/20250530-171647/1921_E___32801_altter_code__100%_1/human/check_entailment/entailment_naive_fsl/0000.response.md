Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column and Alice is above Bob. In this case, the program will print "Draw" instead of "Alice" because it does not consider the possibility of Alice moving diagonally to capture Bob.

For example, if the input is:

6 5 2 2 5 2

The program will print "Draw" instead of "Alice". This is because the program only checks if Alice and Bob are in the same column and if Alice is below Bob, but it does not consider the case when Alice is above Bob and can move diagonally to capture him.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
