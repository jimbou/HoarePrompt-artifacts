Output State: **The program returns nothing and ends the execution. The values of n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2, and r remain unchanged. The current value of x2 is still less than or equal to the current value of x1, and 'draw' is still being printed. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.**
