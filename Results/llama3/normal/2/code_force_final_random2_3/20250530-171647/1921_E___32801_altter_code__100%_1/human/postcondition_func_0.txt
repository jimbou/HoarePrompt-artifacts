Determines the winner of a game based on the positions of two players, Alice and Bob, on a grid. The function takes no arguments and reads input from stdin, which contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of six integers: the height and width of the grid, and the x and y coordinates of Alice and Bob. The function prints 'draw' if Alice's x-coordinate is less than or equal to Bob's x-coordinate, 'Alice' if the difference between their x-coordinates is odd and their y-coordinates are equal, or 'Bob' if the difference between their x-coordinates is even and their y-coordinates are equal. The function returns nothing and ends execution after printing the result.
