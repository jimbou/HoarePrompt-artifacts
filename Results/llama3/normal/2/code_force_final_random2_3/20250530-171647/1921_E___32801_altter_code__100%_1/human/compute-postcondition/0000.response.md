Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^6, m is an integer between 1 and 10^9, x1 is an integer between 1 and n, y1 is an integer between 1 and m, x2 is an integer between 1 and n, y2 is an integer between 1 and m, r is a list of six integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the variables n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 have been assigned integer values from the input. The list r contains the six integers from the input. Stdin now contains one less test case than initially.
