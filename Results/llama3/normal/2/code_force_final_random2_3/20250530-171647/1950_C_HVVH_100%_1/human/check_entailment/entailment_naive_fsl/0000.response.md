Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input hour is 12 and the minute is not 00. For example, if the input is "12:30", the program should output "12:30 PM", but it will output "00:30 PM" instead. This is because the program sets the hour to 12 when the input hour is 0, but it does not handle the case when the input hour is 12 correctly.

The correct logic for handling the hour 12 should be:

* If the hour is 0, set it to 12 and the day to 'AM'
* If the hour is 12, keep it as 12 and set the day to 'PM'
* If the hour is greater than 12, subtract 12 from it and set the day to 'PM'
* If the hour is less than 12, keep it as is and set the day to 'AM'

The corrected code would be:

```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```
