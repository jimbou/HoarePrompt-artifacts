Postcondition: ***`day` is 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 1 and 1440 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If `h` was originally 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` was originally greater than 12, `day` is 'PM' and `h` is decreased by 12. Otherwise, `day` and `h` remain unchanged.***
