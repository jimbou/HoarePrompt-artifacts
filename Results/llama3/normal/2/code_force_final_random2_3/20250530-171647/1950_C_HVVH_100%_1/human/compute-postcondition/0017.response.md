The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1440 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`day` is 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 2 and 1440 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-1 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format**
