Output State: **day is 'AM' if h is not 12, otherwise day is 'PM'. If h is 0, h is set to 12. If h is greater than 12, h is decreased by 12. n is 0, m is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, _ is n, stdin contains 0 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, h is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, m is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, the time in 12-hour format, with hours ranging from 01 to 12, minutes ranging from 00 to 59, and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour, for example, 07:05 AM or 07:05 PM has been printed n times.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be such that the day indicator ('AM' or 'PM') will be determined based on the hour value. If the hour is 0, it will be set to 12 and the day will be 'AM'. If the hour is greater than 12, it will be decreased by 12 and the day will be 'PM'. Otherwise, the day will be 'AM' if the hour is not 12, and 'PM' if the hour is 12. The number of iterations (n) will be 0, and the minute value (m) will be between 0 and 59 inclusive. The loop counter (_) will be equal to the initial value of n. The standard input (stdin) will be empty, containing no strings. The hour value (h) will be between 0 and 23 inclusive, and the minute value (m) will be between 0 and 59 inclusive. The time in 12-hour format, with hours ranging from 01 to 12, minutes ranging from 00 to 59, and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour, will have been printed n times.
