The code prints a formatted string representing a time in 12-hour format. The hour part is represented by the value of `h`, which is an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive, padded with a leading zero if necessary to make it a two-digit number. The minute part is represented by the value of `m`, which is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, also padded with a leading zero if necessary to make it a two-digit number. The time of day is represented by the value of `day`, which is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Output: **hh:mm (where hh is the value of h and mm is the value of m, both padded with leading zeros if necessary, and the time of day is either 'AM' or 'PM')**
