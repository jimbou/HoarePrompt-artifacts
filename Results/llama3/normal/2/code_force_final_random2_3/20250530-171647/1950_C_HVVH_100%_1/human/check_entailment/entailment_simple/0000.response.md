Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly converts the input time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If the hour is 0, it sets the hour to 12 and the day to 'AM'. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.

2. If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the day to 'PM'. This is correct because hours from 13 to 23 in 24-hour format are equivalent to hours from 1 to 11 in 12-hour format, with 'PM' as the day.

3. If the hour is not 0 and not greater than 12, it checks if the hour is 12. If it is, it sets the day to 'PM'. Otherwise, it sets the day to 'AM'. This is correct because hours from 1 to 11 in 24-hour format are equivalent to the same hours in 12-hour format, with 'AM' as the day, and 12:00 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.

4. It then prints the time in 12-hour format, with the hour and minute padded with leading zeroes if necessary, followed by the day ('AM' or 'PM').

The program correctly handles all possible input times in 24-hour format and produces the correct output in 12-hour format.

Correctness: **True**
