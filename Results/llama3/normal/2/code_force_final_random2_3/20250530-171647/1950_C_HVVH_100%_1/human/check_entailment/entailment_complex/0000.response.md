Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times to process each test case.
2. Inside the loop, it correctly reads the time in 24-hour format, splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`, and converts them to integers.
3. The program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format:
	* If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
	* If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
	* If `h` is between 1 and 11, it sets `day` to 'AM'.
	* If `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'.
4. The program correctly prints the converted time in 12-hour format, with hours ranging from 01 to 12, minutes ranging from 00 to 59, and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour.

The execution states of the program provided as comments also confirm that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
