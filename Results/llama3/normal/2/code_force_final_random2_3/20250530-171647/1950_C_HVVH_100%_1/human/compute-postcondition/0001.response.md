According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 1440 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, the loop variable `_` is not initialized. For the loop to execute, `_` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`day` is 'AM', `n` is an integer between 1 and 1440 inclusive, stdin contains t strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, `_` is 0**
