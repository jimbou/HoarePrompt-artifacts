Output State: **`day` is 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is an integer between 2 and 1440 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-2 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format**

In this output state, the values of `day`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `h` is now an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, and the value of `m` is now an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, as they are assigned the values from the input string in the format hh:mm. The stdin now contains t-2 strings, as one string has been consumed by the input operation.
