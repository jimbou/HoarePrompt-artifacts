Output State: **`day` is 'AM', `n` is an integer between 1 and 1440 inclusive, `h` is an integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format**

In this output state, the values of `day` and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `_` is still 0. The stdin now contains one less string because one string has been read and split into `h` and `m`. The values of `h` and `m` are integers representing the hour and minute of a valid time in the 24-hour format, respectively.
