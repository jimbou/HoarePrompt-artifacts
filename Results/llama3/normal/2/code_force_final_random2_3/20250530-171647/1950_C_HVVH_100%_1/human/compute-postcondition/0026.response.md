The code prints a formatted string representing a time in the 12-hour format, followed by either 'AM' or 'PM'. The hour `h` is formatted to always be two digits, padding with a zero if necessary, and the minute `m` is also formatted to always be two digits, padding with a zero if necessary. The `day` variable is either 'AM' or 'PM', depending on the value of `h`.

Since the exact values of `h` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the time. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a time in the format 'hh:mm' followed by either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Output: **hh:mm (where hh is the hour in 12-hour format and mm is the minute, followed by either AM or PM)**
