This function takes an integer t and t strings representing times in 24-hour format as input, converts each time to 12-hour format, and prints the converted times. The function iterates t times, reading a time in 24-hour format, converting it to 12-hour format by adjusting the hour and determining whether it's AM or PM, and then printing the converted time. After processing all t times, the function concludes, having printed t times in 12-hour format.
