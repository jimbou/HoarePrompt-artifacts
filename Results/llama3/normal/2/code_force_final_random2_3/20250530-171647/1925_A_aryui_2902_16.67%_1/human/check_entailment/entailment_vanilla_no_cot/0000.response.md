Correctness: **False** 

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` returns a string `s` which is the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times. However, this string does not satisfy the condition that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.

For example, when `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the function returns the string `"abab"`. However, the string `"ba"` is a possible string of length `2` that can be formed using the first `2` lowercase English alphabets, but it does not occur as a subsequence of `"abab"`.

The correct solution would be to return a string that contains all possible permutations of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, repeated `n` times. This can be achieved by using a recursive function to generate all permutations, or by using a library function that generates permutations.
