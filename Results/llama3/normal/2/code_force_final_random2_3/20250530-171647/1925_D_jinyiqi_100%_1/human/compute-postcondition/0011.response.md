The code prints the result of the expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`. To understand what this expression evaluates to, let's break down the variables involved:

*   `p`: This is the result of the expression `2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)` divided by the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`. The value of `p` depends on the values of `k`, `cn2`, `sum_f`, `m`, and the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
*   `q`: This is the result of the expression `n*(n-1)/2`, which represents the number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of `n` items.
*   `pow(q, -1, M)`: This calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M`. In other words, it finds a number `x` such that `q * x` is congruent to 1 modulo `M`.
*   `M`: This is a large prime number, specifically 1000000007.

Given the complexity of the expression and the lack of specific values for the variables involved, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for the expression. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables and their relationships.

Output: **The result of the expression p \* pow(q, -1, M) % M, where p is the result of the expression 2\*k\*cn2\*sum\_f + m\*k\*(k-1) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is n\*(n-1)/2, and M is 1000000007.**
