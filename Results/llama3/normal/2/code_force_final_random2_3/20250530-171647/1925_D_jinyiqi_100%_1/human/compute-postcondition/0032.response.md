Output State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 2, k is an integer, j is 2, sum_f is equal to the original sum_f plus f plus the third integer from the last input plus the third integer from the current input, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the current input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the current input, f is an integer equal to the third integer from the current input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m minus 1, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is (n*(n-1)/2)^2 divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the value of p multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of q modulo M is being printed.**

The code block reads three integers from the input, assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `f`, and then increments `sum_f` by the value of `f`. This means that `a`, `b`, and `f` now hold the values of the first, second, and third integers from the current input, respectively. The value of `sum_f` is increased by the value of `f`, which is the third integer from the current input. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1. The values of `t`, `i`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.
