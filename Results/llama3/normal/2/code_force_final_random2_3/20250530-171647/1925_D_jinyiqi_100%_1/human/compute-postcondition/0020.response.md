Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is greater than 0, k is an integer, j is 2, sum_f is equal to its original value plus f, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last input, f is an integer equal to the third integer from the last input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m minus 2, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is (n*(n-1)/2), and the value of p multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of q modulo M is being printed.**

The code reads the next three integers from the input, assigning them to `a`, `b`, and `f`, respectively. It then increments `sum_f` by the value of `f`. The values of `t`, `i`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in the input is reduced by 1.
