The only variable in the loop head is variable j and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and m. If j is less than m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 1 and m is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1 and m must be greater than 2.
State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 2, k is an integer, j is 2, sum_f is equal to the original sum_f plus f plus the third integer from the last input, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last input, f is an integer equal to the third integer from the last input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is (n*(n-1)/2)^2 divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the value of p multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of q modulo M is being printed.**
