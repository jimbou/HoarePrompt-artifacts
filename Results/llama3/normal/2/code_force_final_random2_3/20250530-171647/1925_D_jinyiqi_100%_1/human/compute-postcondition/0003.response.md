To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `sum_f` is 0, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. However, these states do not guarantee the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `m` to be greater than 0 and `j` to be 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `sum_f` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `j` is 0**
