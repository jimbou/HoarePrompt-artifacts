Output State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be equal to 0, k is an integer, j is m-1, sum_f is equal to the original sum_f plus the sum of all the third integers from all the inputs, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last input, f is an integer equal to the third integer from the last input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is (n*(n-1)/2)^2 divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the value of p multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of q modulo M is being printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The loop variable `j` is now equal to `m-1`, and the variable `sum_f` has been updated to include the sum of all the third integers from all the inputs. The other variables remain unchanged.
