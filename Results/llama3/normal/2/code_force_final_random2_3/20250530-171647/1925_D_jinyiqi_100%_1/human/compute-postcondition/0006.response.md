The code block consists of two lines. The first line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `f`, respectively. The second line increments `sum_f` by the value of `f`.

Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is greater than 1, k is an integer, j is 1, sum_f is equal to its original value plus f, a is an integer, b is an integer, f is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**
