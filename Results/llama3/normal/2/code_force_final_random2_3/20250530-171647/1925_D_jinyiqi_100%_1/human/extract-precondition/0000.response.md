Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains 3 integers n, m and k, followed by m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, f_i. n is the number of children, m is the number of pairs of friends, and k is the number of excursions. a_i and b_i are the indices of the pair of children who are friends, and f_i is their friendship value. 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.**
