Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, i is t-1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be equal to 0, k is an integer, j is m-1, sum_f is equal to the original sum_f plus the sum of all the third integers from all the inputs, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last input, f is an integer equal to the third integer from the last input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is (n*(n-1)/2)^2 divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the value of p multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of q modulo M is being printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop counter `i` has reached `t-1`, and the loop has processed all the input test cases. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, and `q` are as expected after the last iteration of the loop. The value of `p` multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M` is being printed as the final output.
