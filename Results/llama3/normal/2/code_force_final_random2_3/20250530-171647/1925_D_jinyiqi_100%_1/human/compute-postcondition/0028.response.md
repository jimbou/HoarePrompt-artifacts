Output State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than 0, k is an integer, j is 0, sum_f is equal to the original sum_f plus f, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last input, f is an integer equal to the third integer from the last input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m-1, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is (n*(n-1)/2)^2 divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the value of p multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of q modulo M is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, `q` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `sum_f` is incremented by the value of `f`, which is the third integer from the last input. The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are updated to the first, second, and third integers from the last input, respectively. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1.
