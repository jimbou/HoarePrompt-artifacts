Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, sum_f is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains three space-separated integers, and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by one. The second line initializes `sum_f` to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, and `M` remain unchanged.
