Output State: **t is greater than 1, i is 1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is 0, k is an integer, j is m-1, sum_f is equal to its original value plus the sum of all f values from the inputs, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last input, f is an integer equal to the third integer from the last input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m-1, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is (n*(n-1)/2), and the value of p multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of q modulo M is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables have been updated accordingly. The variable 'm' is now 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable 'j' is now equal to 'm-1', which is -1. The variable 'sum_f' now holds the sum of all 'f' values from the inputs. The values of 'a', 'b', and 'f' are equal to the first, second, and third integers from the last input, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
