Output State: **t is greater than 2, i is 2, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, j is m-1, sum_f is 0, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last input, f is an integer equal to the third integer from the last input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is (n*(n-1)/2)^2 divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the value of p multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of q modulo M is being printed.**

The code block reads three integers from the input, assigning them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `sum_f` is reset to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `M`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `cn2`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1.
