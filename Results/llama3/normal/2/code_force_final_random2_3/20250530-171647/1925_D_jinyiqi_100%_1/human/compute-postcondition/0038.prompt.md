You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains 3 integers n, m and k, followed by m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, f_i. n is the number of children, m is the number of pairs of friends, and k is the number of excursions. a_i and b_i are the indices of the pair of children who are friends, and f_i is their friendship value. 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        sum_f = 0
        
        for j in range(m):
            a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        
        cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
        
        q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
        
        gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
        
        p = p // gcd
        
        q = q // gcd
        
        print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
        
    #State: t is greater than or equal to 0, i is t-1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be equal to 0, k is an integer, j is m-1, sum_f is equal to the original sum_f plus the sum of all the third integers from all the inputs, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last input, f is an integer equal to the third integer from the last input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is (n*(n-1)/2)^2 divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the value of p multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of q modulo M is being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: t is greater than or equal to 0, i is t-1, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be equal to 0, k is an integer, j is m-1, sum_f is equal to the original sum_f plus the sum of all the third integers from all the inputs, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the last input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the last input, f is an integer equal to the third integer from the last input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus m, cn2 is n*(n-1)/2, p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is (n*(n-1)/2)^2 divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, and the value of p multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of q modulo M is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
