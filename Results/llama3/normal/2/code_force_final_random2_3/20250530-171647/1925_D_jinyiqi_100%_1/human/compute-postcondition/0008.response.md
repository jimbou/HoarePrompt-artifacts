Output State: **t is greater than 0, i is 0, M is 1000000007, n is an integer, m is greater than 1, k is an integer, j is 2, sum_f is equal to its original value plus f, a is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, f is an integer equal to the third integer from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `sum_f` is updated by adding the value of `f` to its original value. The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are updated to the integers read from the input. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by three as three integers are read from the input.
