The code prints the value of `p` multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M`. 

Here, `p` is the value of `(2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1))` divided by the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `q` is the value of `(n*(n-1)/2)^2` divided by the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, and `M` is 1000000007.

Since the exact values of `k`, `cn2`, `sum_f`, `m`, `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **p * pow(q, -1, M) % M (where p is (2*k*cn2*sum_f + m*k*(k-1)) divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, q is (n*(n-1)/2)^2 divided by the greatest common divisor of p and q, and M is 1000000007)**
