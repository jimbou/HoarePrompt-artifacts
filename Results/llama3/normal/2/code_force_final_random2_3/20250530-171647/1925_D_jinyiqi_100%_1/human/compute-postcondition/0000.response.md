Output State: **t is an integer, M is 1000000007, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**.

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to t. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, after reading one integer, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The second line assigns the value of 10^9 + 7 to M. No other variables are affected.
