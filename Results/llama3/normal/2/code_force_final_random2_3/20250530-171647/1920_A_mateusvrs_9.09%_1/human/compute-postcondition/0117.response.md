Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the product of `a` and `x`. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` contains `x`.***
