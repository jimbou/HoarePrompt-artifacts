Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing either one element which is `x` or two elements which are `x` and the previous value of `x`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n-1` integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 2, the value of `_` is still 2, the value of `t` is still greater than 0. The value of `r` is still a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. The value of `a` is still an integer, the value of `x` is still an integer, the value of `ax` is still either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, the value of `bx` is still either -1 or the maximum of `x` and -1. The value of `cx` is now a set containing either one element which is `x` or two elements which are `x` and the previous value of `x`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `n-1` integers.
