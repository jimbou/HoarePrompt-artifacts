Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is not 1 or 2, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

- The loop counter `n` will be 0, and the temporary counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `n`.
- The variable `t` will still be greater than 0.
- The list `r` will contain either a single element 0 (if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`) or at least one element calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
- The variables `a` and `x` will hold the last values read from the input.
- The variable `ax` will hold the minimum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` is 2.
- The variable `bx` will hold the maximum value of all `x` values encountered when `a` is 1.
- The set `cx` will contain all `x` values encountered when `a` is neither 1 nor 2.
- The standard input `stdin` will have been consumed by `n` integers.
