Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of the initial value of `ax` and all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of the initial value of `bx` and all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is an empty set, `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` is a list containing at least three elements where the last two elements are `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` and `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is equal to the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `_`, `t`, `a`, `x`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, and `tmp` remain the same as in the initial state. The list `r` now contains at least three elements, where the last two elements are the same and equal to `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
