The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and cx, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cx.  If the set cx has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, cx has at least one element, i is the first element in cx. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set cx must have at least 2 elements and the i is the second element in cx.
State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of the initial value of `ax` and all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of the initial value of `bx` and all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least two elements, `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the second element in `cx`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.**
