The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is not 1 or 2, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` is a list containing two elements which are 0. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `cx` is an empty set, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax`.**
