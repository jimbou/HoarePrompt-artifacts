Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. If `a` is 1, then `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is an empty set, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n-1` integers. `x` is an integer, and `a` is an integer.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `_`, `t`, and `r` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `a` and `x` are updated to the values read from the input. The values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are updated based on the value of `a`. If `a` is 1, then `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. The number of integers in `stdin` is decreased by 1.
