Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` and `x` are assigned the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers, `cx` is a set that must contain at least `len(cx)` elements, `i` is another element in `cx`, `bx` is strictly less than `ax`. If all elements in `cx` are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is `len(cx)`. Otherwise, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

In this output state, the list `r` now contains at least one element, which is the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. The value of `tmp` depends on whether all elements in `cx` are within the range `[bx, ax]`. If they are, `tmp` is equal to the length of `cx`; otherwise, it's the count of elements in `cx` that fall within this range. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
