Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `a` equals 2, `x` is an integer, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value (1000000007) and the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two integers, as the code does not consume any input.
