Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` and `x` are assigned the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing `x`. Additionally, `bx` is strictly less than `ax`, and `tmp` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `tmp` that is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `a`, `x`, `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` still hold.
