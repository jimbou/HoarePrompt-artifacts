Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `_` is `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers.***
