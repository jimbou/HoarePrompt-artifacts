Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is either equal to `x` or a multiple of `x`. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` contains `x` and possibly other values. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`.***
