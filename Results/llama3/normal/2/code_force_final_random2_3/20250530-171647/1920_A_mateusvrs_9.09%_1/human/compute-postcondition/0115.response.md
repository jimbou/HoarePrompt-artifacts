Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `cx` contains `x`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers except the first integer which was assigned to `a` and `x`**

In this output state, the value of `cx` has been updated to include the value of `x`, which was assigned from the input. The values of `n`, `_`, `a`, and `x` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers except the first integer which was assigned to `a` and `x`.
