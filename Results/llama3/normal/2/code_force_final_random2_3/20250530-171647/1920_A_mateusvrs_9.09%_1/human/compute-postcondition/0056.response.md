Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, cx is a set containing one element which is `x`, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, t is greater than 0, r is a list containing one element which is 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, otherwise r is a list containing at least one element which is ax - bx + 1 - tmp, a is an integer not equal to 1 or 2, x is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n-1 integers**

In this output state, the value of `cx` has been updated to include the integer `x`, and the number of test cases in stdin has been reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
