Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer not equal to 1 and not equal to 2, `x` is an integer, `cx` contains `x`**.

The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the collection `cx`. The initial state of `cx` is not specified, but after executing the code, `cx` now contains the value of `x`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `_`, `a`) remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one less input.
