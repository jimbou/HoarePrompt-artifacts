Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` and `x` are assigned the values from the input, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `x` are updated to the values read from the input, which are integers. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers. The conditions related to `a` and `x` are still valid, but their values have been updated.
