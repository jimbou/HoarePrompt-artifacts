Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing either one element which is `x` or two elements which are `x` and the previous value of `x`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n-1` integers. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is either `x` or 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing either one element which is `x` or two elements which are `x` and the previous value of `x`.***
