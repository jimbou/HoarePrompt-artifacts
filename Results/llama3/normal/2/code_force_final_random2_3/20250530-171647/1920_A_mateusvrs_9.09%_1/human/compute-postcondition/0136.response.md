Output State: **t is 0, r is a list containing t elements, n is 0, _ is 0, a is an integer, x is an integer, ax is the minimum of the initial value of ax and all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of the initial value of bx and all x values where a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values where a is neither 1 nor 2, and stdin is empty. If bx is greater than or equal to ax, all elements in r are 0. Otherwise, all elements in r are ax - bx + 1 - tmp, and tmp is the count of elements in cx that are within the range of bx and ax.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of t becomes 0, and the list r contains t elements. The value of n and the loop variable _ become 0. The values of a and x are the last values assigned to them in the loop. The value of ax is the minimum of the initial value of ax and all x values where a is 2, and the value of bx is the maximum of the initial value of bx and all x values where a is 1. The set cx contains all x values where a is neither 1 nor 2. The standard input stdin is empty. If bx is greater than or equal to ax, all elements in r are 0. Otherwise, all elements in r are ax - bx + 1 - tmp, where tmp is the count of elements in cx that are within the range of bx and ax.
