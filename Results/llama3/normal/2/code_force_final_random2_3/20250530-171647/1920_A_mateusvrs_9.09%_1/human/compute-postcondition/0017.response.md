Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ax` is still dependent on the value of `a`. If `a` is 1, `bx` is still the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is still the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is now the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` is still a set containing `x`. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one.
