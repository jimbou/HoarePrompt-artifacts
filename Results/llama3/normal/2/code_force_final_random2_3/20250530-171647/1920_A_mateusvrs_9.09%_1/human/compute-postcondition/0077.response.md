Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - 0`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is 0, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to 0. The other variables remain unchanged, and their relationships and constraints are still valid. The list `r` still contains elements that are calculated based on the values of `ax`, `bx`, and `tmp`, but now `tmp` is 0, so the elements in `r` are simply `ax - bx + 1`. The input in `stdin` is also unchanged, as the code does not interact with it.
