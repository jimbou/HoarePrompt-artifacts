Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` and `x` are assigned the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `a` equals 1, the current value of `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, the current value of `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, the current value of `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing `x`. The current value of `bx` is greater than or equal to the current value of `ax`.**

In this output state, the list `r` now contains one element which is 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables are still valid, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers.
