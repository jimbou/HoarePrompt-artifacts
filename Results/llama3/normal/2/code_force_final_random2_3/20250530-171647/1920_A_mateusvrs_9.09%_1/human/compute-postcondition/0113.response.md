Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of `x` and its previous value. The values of `n`, `_`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers, as the code did not consume any input.
