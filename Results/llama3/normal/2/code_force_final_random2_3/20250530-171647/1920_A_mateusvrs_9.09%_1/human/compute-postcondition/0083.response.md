Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - 0`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least two `x` values where `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the second element in `cx`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, `tmp` is set to 2, otherwise `tmp` remains 1.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, `tmp` is now 2, otherwise it remains 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
