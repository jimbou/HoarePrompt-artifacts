Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the product of `a` and `x`. Otherwise, `cx` contains `x`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers except the first integer which was assigned to `a` and `x`.***
