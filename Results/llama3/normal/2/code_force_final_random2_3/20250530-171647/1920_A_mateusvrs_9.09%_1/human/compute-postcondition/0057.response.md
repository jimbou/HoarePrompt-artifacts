Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n-1` integers. `bx` is -1, `x` is an integer, and `a` is an integer not equal to 1.***
