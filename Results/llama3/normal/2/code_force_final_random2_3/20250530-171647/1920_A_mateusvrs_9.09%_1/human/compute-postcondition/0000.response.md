The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, after this line, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. The second line initializes an empty list `r`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is an integer, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer**
