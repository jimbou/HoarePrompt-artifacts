Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `cx` contains `x` and possibly other values**.

In this output state, the value of `cx` has been updated to include the current value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `cx` is a collection (likely a set) that can contain multiple values, so it now contains at least the current value of `x`, and possibly other values that were already present in `cx` before the code was executed.
