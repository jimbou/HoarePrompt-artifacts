The only object in the loop head is variable `i` and set `cx`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If the set `cx` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` has at least 1 element, `i` is an element in `cx`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set `cx` must have at least 2 elements and `i` is another element in `cx`.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` and `x` are assigned the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers, `cx` is a set that must contain at least 2 elements, `i` is another element in `cx`, `bx` is strictly less than `ax`, and `tmp` is 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` remains 0**
