According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and _ is now 0. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, t is greater than 0, r is a list containing one element which is 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, otherwise r is a list containing at least one element which is ax - bx + 1 - tmp, a and x are assigned the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n + 1 integers.**
