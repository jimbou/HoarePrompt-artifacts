The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` must be less than `n`. Since `_` is equal to `n` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again `_` must be less than `n`. So `_` is `n - 1` and `t` is greater than 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is `n - 1`, `a` and `x` are assigned the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `a` equals 1, the current value of `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, the current value of `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, the current value of `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing `x`. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. Otherwise, `bx` is strictly less than `ax`, `cx` is a set that must contain at least `len(cx)` elements, `i` is another element in `cx`. If all elements in `cx` are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is `len(cx)`. Otherwise, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**
