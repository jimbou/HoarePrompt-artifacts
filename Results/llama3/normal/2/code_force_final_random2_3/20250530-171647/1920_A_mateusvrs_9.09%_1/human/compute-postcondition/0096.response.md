Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a` is 1, `x` is an integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`, stdin contains one less input.**

In this output state, the value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of `x` and its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains one less input.
