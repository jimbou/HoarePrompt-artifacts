Output: **t is 0, r is a list containing t elements, n is 0, _ is 0, a is an integer, x is an integer, ax is the minimum of the initial value of ax and all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of the initial value of bx and all x values where a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values where a is neither 1 nor 2, and stdin is empty. If bx is greater than or equal to ax, all elements in r are 0. Otherwise, all elements in r are ax - bx + 1 - tmp, and tmp is the count of elements in cx that are within the range of bx and ax. The elements of r are printed, separated by newline characters. If bx is greater than or equal to ax, the output will be a series of zeros, each on a new line. Otherwise, the output will be a series of values equal to ax - bx + 1 - tmp, each on a new line.**
