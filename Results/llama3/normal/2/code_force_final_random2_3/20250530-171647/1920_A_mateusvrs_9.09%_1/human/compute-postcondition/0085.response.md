To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `cx`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `cx` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element in `cx`, and `cx` has at least two elements.

For the loop to execute again, `i` should be the next element in `cx`, and `cx` should have at least one more element. Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - 0`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least three `x` values where `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is either 1 or 2, and `i` is the third element in `cx`.**

Note that the state of `tmp` is not adjusted, as it is not a variable in the loop head.
