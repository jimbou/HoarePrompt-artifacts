Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` and `x` are assigned the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers, `cx` is a set that must contain at least one element, `i` is an element in `cx`, `bx` is strictly less than `ax`, `tmp` is 0. The current value of `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), meaning `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.***
