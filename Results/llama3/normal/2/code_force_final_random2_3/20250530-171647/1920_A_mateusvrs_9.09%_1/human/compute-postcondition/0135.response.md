Postcondition: ***n is 0, _ is 0, t is greater than 1, a is an integer, x is an integer, ax is the minimum of the initial value of ax and all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of the initial value of bx and all x values where a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values where a is neither 1 nor 2, and stdin is empty. If bx is greater than or equal to ax, r is a list containing three elements which are 0. Otherwise, r is a list containing at least three elements where the last two elements are ax - bx + 1 - tmp, and tmp is the count of elements in cx that are within the range of bx and ax.***
