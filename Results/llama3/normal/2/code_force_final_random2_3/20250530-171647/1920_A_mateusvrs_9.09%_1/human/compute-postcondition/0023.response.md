Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.**

In this output state, the value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of `x` and its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the previous value of `bx` is not explicitly stated in the initial state, so it is still unknown. However, we can express `bx` in terms of its previous value and `x`. The values of `a` and `x` are still integers, but their specific values are not updated by this code snippet. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two integers.
