Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the product of `a` and `x`**.

In this output state, the values of `n`, `_`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and the product of `a` and `x`. This means that `ax` will be the smaller of the two values, either `x` or `a*x`. The stdin is now empty since it contained a space-separated list of integers that were assigned to `a` and `x`.
