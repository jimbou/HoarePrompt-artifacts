Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `a` is 1, `x` is an integer, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers.**

In this output state, the value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (-1) and the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `r` still depends on the value of `bx` relative to `ax`, and its contents are determined by the condition `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. The input in `stdin` remains the same, with multiple test cases minus `n` integers.
