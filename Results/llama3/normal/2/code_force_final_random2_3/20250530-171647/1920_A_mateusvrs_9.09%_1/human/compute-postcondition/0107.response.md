Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is not 1, then if `a` is 2, `ax` is either equal to `x` or a multiple of `x`. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` contains `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `a` and the values of `bx` and `cx` are still valid, but the value of `ax` has been specifically updated.
