Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `a` is 2, `x` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers.**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value (1000000007) and the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ax` is now a specific value that is either `x` or 1000000007, whichever is smaller.
