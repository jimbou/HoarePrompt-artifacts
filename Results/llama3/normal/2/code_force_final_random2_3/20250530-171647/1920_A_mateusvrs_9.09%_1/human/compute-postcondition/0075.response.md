Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing two elements which are 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is not 1 or 2, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 0 integers. The current value of `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`.**

In this output state, the list `r` now contains two elements, both of which are 0, as a result of appending 0 to the list. The other variables remain unchanged, and the relationship between `bx` and `ax` is still valid.
