Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is not 1, then if `a` is 2, `ax` is either equal to `x` or a multiple of `x`. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` contains `x`.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `x` are assigned new values from the input, which is now empty. The conditions related to `a` and the variables `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` are updated based on the new value of `a`.
