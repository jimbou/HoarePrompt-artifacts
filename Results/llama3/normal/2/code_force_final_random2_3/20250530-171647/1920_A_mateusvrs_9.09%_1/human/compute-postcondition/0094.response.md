Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains one less input.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `_` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of two integers from the input to `a` and `x`, respectively. Since the input contains two integers, after this operation, the stdin contains one less input.
