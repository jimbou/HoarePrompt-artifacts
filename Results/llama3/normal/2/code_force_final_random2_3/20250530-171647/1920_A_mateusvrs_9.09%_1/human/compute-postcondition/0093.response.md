To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `_` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `_` is the loop variable, it will take on values from 0 to `n-1` during the loop execution.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
