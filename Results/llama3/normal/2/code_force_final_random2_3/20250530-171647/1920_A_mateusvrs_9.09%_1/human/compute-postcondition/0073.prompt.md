Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, t is greater than 0, r is a list containing one element which is 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, otherwise r is a list containing at least one element which is ax - bx + 1 - tmp, _ is n - 1, a and x are assigned the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n + 1 integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. If `a` is 1, then `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is an empty set, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n-1` integers. `x` is an integer, and `a` is an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. If `a` is 1, then `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and either -1 or the previous value of `bx`, `cx` is an empty set, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is an empty set, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is a set containing either one element which is `x` or two elements which are `x` and the previous value of `x`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus either `n` or `n-1` integers. `x` is an integer, and `a` is an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing either one element which is `x` or two elements which are `x` and the previous value of `x`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n-1` integers. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is either `x` or the previous value of `bx` if `x` is greater than the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is either `x` or 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing either one element which is `x` or two elements which are `x` and the previous value of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
