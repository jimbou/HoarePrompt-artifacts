Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` and `x` are assigned the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing `x`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `r` remains an empty list.
- `n` will be greater than or equal to 0, depending on its initial value.
- `_` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
- `a` and `x` will hold the last two integers read from the input.
- The standard input (`stdin`) will contain multiple test cases minus `n` integers, as `n` pairs of integers have been read and processed.
- The values of `bx` and `ax` will depend on the operations performed within the loop:
  - If `a` equals 1, `bx` will be the maximum of `x` and its previous value.
  - If `a` equals 2, `ax` will be the minimum of `x` and its previous value.
  - If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `ax` will remain 1000000007, and `cx` will be a set containing `x`.
- The state of other variables not affected by the loop (`t`, `r`, and the initial values of `ax` and `bx`) remains unchanged.
