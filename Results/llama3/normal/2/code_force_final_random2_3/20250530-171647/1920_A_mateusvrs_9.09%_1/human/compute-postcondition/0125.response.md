Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of the initial value of `ax` and all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of the initial value of `bx` and all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element, `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is 1, `i` is the first element in `cx`. The current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships. The list `r` still contains at least two elements, with the last element being `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, which is now `ax - bx + 1 - 1` due to the increment of `tmp`. The set `cx` and the value of `i` also remain unchanged.
