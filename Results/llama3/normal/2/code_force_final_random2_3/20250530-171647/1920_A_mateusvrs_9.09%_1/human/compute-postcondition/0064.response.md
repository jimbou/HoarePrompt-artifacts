Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. If `a` is 1, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x` if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing two elements which are `x` and the previous value of `x`. `x` is an integer, and `a` is an integer, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n-1` integers.***
