Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of the initial value of `ax` and all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of the initial value of `bx` and all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `bx` and `ax` is still valid, and the list `r` still contains at least two elements with the last element being `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, which is now `ax - bx + 1` since `tmp` is 0.
