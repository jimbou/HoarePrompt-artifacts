The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and set `cx`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`.  If the set has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `cx` has at least 1 element, `i` is an element in `cx`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the set.
State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - 0`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least two `x` values where `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the second element in `cx`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax`, `tmp` is set to 1, otherwise `tmp` remains 0.**
