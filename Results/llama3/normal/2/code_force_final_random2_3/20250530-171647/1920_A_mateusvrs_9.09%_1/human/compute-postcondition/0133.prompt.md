Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of the initial value of `ax` and all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of the initial value of `bx` and all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of the initial value of `ax` and all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of the initial value of `bx` and all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element, `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first element in `cx`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of the initial value of `ax` and all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of the initial value of `bx` and all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least two elements, `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 2. Otherwise, `tmp` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of the initial value of `ax` and all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of the initial value of `bx` and all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least three elements, `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 3. Otherwise, `tmp` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
