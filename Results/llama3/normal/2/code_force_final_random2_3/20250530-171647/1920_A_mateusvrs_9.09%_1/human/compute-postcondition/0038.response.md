Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` and `x` are assigned the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers, `cx` is a set that must contain at least 2 elements, `i` is another element in `cx`, `bx` is strictly less than `ax`, and `tmp` is 2 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1. If `i` is within the range of `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is now 2; otherwise, it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
