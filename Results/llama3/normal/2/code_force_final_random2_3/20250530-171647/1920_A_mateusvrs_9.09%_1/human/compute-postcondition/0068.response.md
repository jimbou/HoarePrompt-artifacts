Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is either `x` or the previous value of `bx` if `x` is greater than the previous value of `bx`, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing either one element which is `x` or two elements which are `x` and the previous value of `x`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n-1` integers.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x`. This means that `bx` will now be either `x` or its previous value, whichever is greater. The other variables remain unchanged.
