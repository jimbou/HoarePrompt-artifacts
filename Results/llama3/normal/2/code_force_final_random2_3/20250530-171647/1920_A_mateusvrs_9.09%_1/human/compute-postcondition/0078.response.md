To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the set `cx`. The loop will execute if `cx` is not empty.

State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - 0`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one `x` value where `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is 0, `i` is an element in `cx`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers.**
