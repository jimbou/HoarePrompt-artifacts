According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is greater than 0, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer, _ is 0, n is an integer, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `_` is 0 and n is greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer, _ is 0, n is greater than 0, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1**
