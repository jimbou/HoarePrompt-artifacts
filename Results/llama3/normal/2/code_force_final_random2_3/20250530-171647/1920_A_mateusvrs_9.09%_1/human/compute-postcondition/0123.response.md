To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the set `cx`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If `cx` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2. To ensure the loop executes, `cx` must have at least 1 element.

State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of the initial value of `ax` and all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of the initial value of `bx` and all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element, `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is 0, `i` is the first element in `cx`**
