Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx >= ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` and `x` are assigned the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `a` equals 1, the current value of `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, the current value of `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, the current value of `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing `x`. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. Otherwise, `bx` is strictly less than `ax`, `cx` is a set that must contain at least `len(cx)` elements, `i` is another element in `cx`. If all elements in `cx` are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is `len(cx)`. Otherwise, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values where `a` is not 1 or 2, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` is a list containing two elements which are 0. Otherwise, `r` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `cx` is an empty set, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is 0, _ is 0, t is greater than 1, a is an integer, x is an integer, ax is the minimum of the initial value of ax and all x values where a is 2, bx is the maximum of the initial value of bx and all x values where a is 1, cx is a set containing all x values where a is neither 1 nor 2, and stdin is empty. If bx is greater than or equal to ax, r is a list containing three elements which are 0. Otherwise, r is a list containing at least three elements where the last two elements are ax - bx + 1 - tmp, and tmp is the count of elements in cx that are within the range of bx and ax.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
