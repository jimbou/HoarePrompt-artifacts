Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is either `x` or 1000000007, `bx` is either -1 or the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing either one element which is `x` or two elements which are `x` and the previous value of `x`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n-1` integers.**

In this output state, the value of `ax` has been updated to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. This means that if `x` is less than `ax`, `ax` will be updated to `x`, otherwise `ax` will remain the same. The other variables remain unchanged.
