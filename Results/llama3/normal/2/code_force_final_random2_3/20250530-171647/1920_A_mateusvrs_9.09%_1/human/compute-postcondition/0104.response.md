To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head variables and how they change based on the loop's condition.

The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `_` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it's a range-based loop), and `n` remains the same.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be 1, and `n` should still be an integer greater than 0.

The other variables mentioned in the state (`a`, `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `x`, and `stdin`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains one less input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is not 1, then if `a` is 2, `ax` is either equal to `x` or a multiple of `x`. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` contains `x`.**
