The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is either equal to `x` or a multiple of `x` if `a` is 1, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`. If `a` is not 2, then `cx` contains `x` and possibly other values.**
