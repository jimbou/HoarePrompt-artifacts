The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer, `r` is an empty list, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer, `_` is 0**
