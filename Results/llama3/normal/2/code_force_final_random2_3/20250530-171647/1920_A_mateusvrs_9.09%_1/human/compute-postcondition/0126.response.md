Postcondition: ***`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of the initial value of `ax` and all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of the initial value of `bx` and all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element, `bx` is less than `ax`, `r` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first element in `cx`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.***
