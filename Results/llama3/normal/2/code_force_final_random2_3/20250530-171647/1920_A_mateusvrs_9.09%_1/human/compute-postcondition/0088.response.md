Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - 0`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is an empty set, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

- The variables `n`, `_`, `t`, `r`, `a`, `x`, `ax`, `bx`, and `stdin` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The set `cx` is empty, indicating that all elements in `cx` have been processed by the loop.
- The variable `tmp` now holds the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range of `bx` and `ax`. This count represents the number of elements in `cx` that satisfy the condition `i >= bx and i <= ax`.
