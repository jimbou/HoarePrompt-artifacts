Output State: **`n` is 0, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing at least two elements where the last element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is an empty set, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range of `bx` and `ax`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers.**

In this output state, the list `r` now contains at least two elements, where the last element is the result of the expression `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers.
