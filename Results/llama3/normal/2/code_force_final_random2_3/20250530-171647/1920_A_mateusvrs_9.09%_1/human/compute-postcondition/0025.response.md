Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` and `x` are assigned the next two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two integers. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing `x`. `cx` is a set containing `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `cx` is now a set containing the value of `x`. The values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `_`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two integers. The conditions for `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` based on the value of `a` are still applicable.
