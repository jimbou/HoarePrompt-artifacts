Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing `x`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `x` are updated to the integers read from the input. The value of `bx` is updated based on the value of `a`. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing `x`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one integer.
