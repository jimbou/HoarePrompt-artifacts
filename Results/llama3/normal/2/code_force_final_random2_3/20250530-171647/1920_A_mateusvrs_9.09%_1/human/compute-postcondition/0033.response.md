To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the set `cx`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `cx`. If `cx` is not empty, the loop will execute. 

Before the loop starts, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` and `x` are assigned the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing `x`. Additionally, `bx` is strictly less than `ax`, and `tmp` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `cx` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `cx` to ensure it contains at least one element.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` and `x` are assigned the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers, `cx` is a set that must contain at least one element, `i` is an element in `cx`, `bx` is strictly less than `ax`, `tmp` is 0**
