The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
