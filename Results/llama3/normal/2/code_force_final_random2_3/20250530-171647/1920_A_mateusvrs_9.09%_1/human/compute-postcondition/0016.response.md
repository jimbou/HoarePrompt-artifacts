Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `x`. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `bx` has been updated to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`. Since `bx` was previously defined as the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` equals 1, the new value of `bx` is simply the maximum of `x` and `x`, which is just `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
