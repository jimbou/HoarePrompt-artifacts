Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `cx` is a set containing `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `_`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. The set `cx` now contains the value of `x`. The conditions for `bx` and `ax` are still dependent on the value of `a`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one integer.
