To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

The variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so its value is not relevant to the loop execution.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is a list containing one element which is 0 if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `r` is a list containing at least one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. If `a` is 1, then `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is an empty set, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n-1` integers. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n-1` integers. If `a` is not 1 or 2, then `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing one element which is `x`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `n-2` integers. `x` is an integer, and `a` is an integer.**
