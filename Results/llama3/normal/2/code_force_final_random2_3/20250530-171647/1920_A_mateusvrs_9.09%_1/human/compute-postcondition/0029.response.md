Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` and `x` are assigned the last two integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` integers. If `a` equals 1, the current value of `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, the current value of `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, the current value of `ax` is 1000000007 and `cx` is a set containing `x`. The current value of `bx` is greater than or equal to the current value of `ax`.**
