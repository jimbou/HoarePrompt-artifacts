Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, cx is an empty set, ax is 1000000007, bx is -1, t is greater than 0, r is a list containing one element which is 0 if bx is greater than or equal to ax, otherwise r is a list containing at least one element which is ax - bx + 1 - tmp, a is an integer, x is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `_`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `t`, and `r` remain the same as in the initial state. The variables `a` and `x` are assigned the last two integers from the input, which are now integers. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus n integers.
