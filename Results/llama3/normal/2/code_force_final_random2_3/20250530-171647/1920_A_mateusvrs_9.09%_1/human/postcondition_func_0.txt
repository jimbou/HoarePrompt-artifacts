This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines of two integers a and x. It then processes each test case by maintaining the maximum value of x when a is 1, the minimum value of x when a is 2, and a set of x values when a is 3. If the maximum value of x when a is 1 is greater than or equal to the minimum value of x when a is 2, it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it appends the difference between the minimum value of x when a is 2 and the maximum value of x when a is 1, plus 1, minus the count of x values in the set that fall within this range. Finally, it prints the result list, one element per line.
