Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It maintains the maximum value of x when a is 1, the minimum value of x when a is 2, and a set of x values when a is 3. It then checks if the maximum value of x when a is 1 is greater than or equal to the minimum value of x when a is 2. If it is, it appends 0 to the result list, indicating that there are no integers that satisfy all the constraints. Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers that satisfy all the constraints by subtracting the count of x values in the set that fall within the range from the difference between the minimum value of x when a is 2 and the maximum value of x when a is 1, plus 1.

Correctness: **True**
