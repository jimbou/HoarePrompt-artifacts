Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a sequence of non-negative integers that meets certain conditions. The program uses a predefined sequence of powers of 2, which is a common approach to solve this type of problem.

The program correctly reads the input data, processes each test case, and generates the output in the required format. The use of a predefined sequence of powers of 2 ensures that the program can handle a wide range of input values.

However, the program does not take into account the specific values of n and k in each test case. It simply generates the same sequence of powers of 2 for every test case, regardless of the values of n and k. This may not always produce the correct output, as the problem statement requires the sequence to meet certain conditions based on the values of n and k.

Therefore, the correctness of the program depends on the specific input values. If the input values are such that the predefined sequence of powers of 2 meets the required conditions, the program will produce the correct output. However, if the input values are such that the predefined sequence does not meet the required conditions, the program will produce incorrect output.

Correctness: **False**
