Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 3 pairs, `n` is the third n in the list, `k` is the third k in the list, `results` is a list containing three tuples (25, sequence) where sequence is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list `cases` also remains unchanged with at least 3 pairs of positive integers. The values of `n` and `k` are still the third n and k in the list, respectively. The list `results` has been updated to contain three tuples, each with the first element being 25 and the second element being a list of 25 integers that are powers of 2.
