To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for (n, k) in cases:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `n`, `k`, and `cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cases` list. If `cases` has at least one more pair of positive integers, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cases` has at least 1 pair, `n` is the first `n` in the list, and `k` is the first `k` in the list. For the loop to execute again, `cases` must have at least 2 pairs, and `n` and `k` should be the second pair in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 2 pairs, `n` is the second n in the list, `k` is the second k in the list, `results` is a list containing a tuple (25, sequence) where sequence is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2**
