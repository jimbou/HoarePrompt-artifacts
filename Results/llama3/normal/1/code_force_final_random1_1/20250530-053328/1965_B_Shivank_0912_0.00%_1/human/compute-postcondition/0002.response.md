Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 1 pair, `n` is the first n in the list, `k` is the first k in the list, `results` is a list containing a tuple (25, sequence) where sequence is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2**.

In this output state, the values of `t`, `cases`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `results` list, which now contains a tuple with the value (25, sequence). The sequence is still a list of 25 integers, each being a power of 2.
