To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for (n, k) in cases:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `n`, `k`, and `cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cases` list. If the list has at least 3 pairs, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `cases` has at least 2 pairs, `n` is the second `n` in the list, and `k` is the second `k` in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `cases` list must have at least 3 pairs. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `cases` to have at least 3 pairs. We also need to adjust the states of `n` and `k` to be the third `n` and `k` in the list, respectively.

The state of `t` and `results` is not affected by the loop head, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 3 pairs, `n` is the third n in the list, `k` is the third k in the list, `results` is a list containing two tuples (25, sequence) where sequence is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2**
