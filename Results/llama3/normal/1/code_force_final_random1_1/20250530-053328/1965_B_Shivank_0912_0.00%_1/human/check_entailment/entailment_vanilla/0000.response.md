Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a sequence of non-negative integers that meets certain conditions. The program reads input from the standard input, processes it, and then prints the results.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the program does not actually solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` simply returns a fixed sequence of 25 numbers, which are powers of 2, for every test case. This sequence does not take into account the values of `n` and `k` provided in the input, which are crucial for determining the correct sequence.

In other words, the program does not actually attempt to find a sequence that meets the conditions specified in the problem. Instead, it simply returns a predetermined sequence that may not satisfy the conditions for any given input.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
