Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is an empty list, results is a list containing t tuples (25, sequence) where sequence is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer, the list `cases` is now empty because all pairs of positive integers have been processed, and the list `results` contains `t` tuples, each containing the value 25 and the list `sequence` of 25 integers that are powers of 2.
