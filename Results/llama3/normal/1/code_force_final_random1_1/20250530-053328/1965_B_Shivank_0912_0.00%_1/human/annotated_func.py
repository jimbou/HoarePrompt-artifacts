#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer and cases is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
    results = []
    sequence = [(2 ** i) for i in range(25)]
    for (n, k) in cases:
        results.append((25, sequence))
        
    #State: t is a positive integer, cases is an empty list, results is a list containing t tuples (25, sequence) where sequence is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2
    return results
    #The program returns a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains 25 and a sequence of 25 integers, each of which is a power of 2.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the integer 25 and a sequence of 25 integers that are powers of 2. The number of tuples in the list is equal to the number of input cases. The function does not modify the input cases.
