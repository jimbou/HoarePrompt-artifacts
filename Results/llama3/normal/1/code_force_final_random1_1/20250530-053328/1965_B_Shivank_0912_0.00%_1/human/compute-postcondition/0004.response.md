Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 2 pairs, `n` is the second n in the list, `k` is the second k in the list, `results` is a list containing two tuples (25, sequence) where sequence is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `cases`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `results` list, which now contains two tuples, each with the value 25 and a sequence of 25 integers that are powers of 2.
