Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, cases is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, results is an empty list, sequence is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2.
Code of the loop:
for n, k in cases:
    results.append((25, sequence))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 1 pair, `n` is the first n in the list, `k` is the first k in the list, `results` is a list containing a tuple (25, sequence) where sequence is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 2 pairs, `n` is the second n in the list, `k` is the second k in the list, `results` is a list containing two tuples (25, sequence) where sequence is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 3 pairs, `n` is the third n in the list, `k` is the third k in the list, `results` is a list containing three tuples (25, sequence) where sequence is a list of 25 integers where each integer is a power of 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
