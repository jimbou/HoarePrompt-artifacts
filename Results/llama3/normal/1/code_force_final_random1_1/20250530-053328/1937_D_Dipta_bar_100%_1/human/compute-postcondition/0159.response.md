Postcondition: **The program prints a value based on the conditions of the if-else block. If `r` is 0, the program prints a value based on the indices of '>' and '<' in `s`, the lengths of lists `A` and `B`, and the values of `n` and `i`. If `r` is not 0, the program prints a value calculated based on the values of `a` and `b`, where `a` is the sum of the value at index `r-1` in list `B` and the product of the difference between the value at index `r-1` in list `idx_B` and `i`, and `r`, and `b` is the value at index `l-1` in list `A`, minus the value at index `l-r-1` in list `A`, minus the product of the difference between the values at indices `l-1` and `l-r-1` in list `idx_A` and `l-r`, plus the product of the difference between `i` and the value at index `l-1` in list `idx_A` and `r`, or the value at index `l-1` in list `A`, plus the product of the difference between `i` and the value at index `l-1` in list `idx_A` and `r`. The values of `r`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged.**
