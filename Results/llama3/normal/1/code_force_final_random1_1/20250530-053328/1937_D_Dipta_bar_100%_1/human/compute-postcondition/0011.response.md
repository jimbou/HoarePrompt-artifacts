Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `A` is a list containing one element: 0**

In this output state, the code has appended the value 0 to the list `A`. The other variables, `s`, `n`, and `i`, remain unchanged. The length of `s` is still greater than 1, and `i` is still 1. The list `A` now contains a single element, which is 0.
