Output State: **The value of `a` remains unchanged, equal to the sum of the value at index `r-1` in list `B` and the product of the difference between the value at index `r-1` in list `idx_B` and `i`, and `r`. If `l - r > 0`, the value of `b` is the value at index `l-1` in list `A`, minus the value at index `l-r-1` in list `A`, minus the product of the difference between the values at indices `l-1` and `l-r-1` in list `idx_A` and `l-r`, plus the product of the difference between `i` and the value at index `l-1` in list `idx_A` and `r`. Otherwise, the value of `b` is the value at index `l-1` in list `A`, plus the product of the difference between `i` and the value at index `l-1` in list `idx_A` and `r`. The values of `r`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the value of `a` remains the same, while the value of `b` is updated by adding the product of the difference between `i` and the value at index `l-1` in list `idx_A` and `r`. If `l - r > 0`, this update is in addition to the previous value of `b`, which was the difference between two values in list `A` minus the product of the difference between two values in list `idx_A` and `l-r`. If `l - r <= 0`, the update is added to the value at index `l-1` in list `A`. The other variables remain unchanged.
