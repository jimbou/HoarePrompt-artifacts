Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules of the pinball movement and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program first initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to store the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' and '<' characters, respectively. It then iterates over the string `s` from left to right and right to left, respectively, to calculate the cumulative sums.

The program then iterates over the string `s` again, this time from left to right, and for each character, it calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. It uses the cumulative sums stored in `A` and `B` to calculate this number.

The program handles cases where the string starts or ends with '<' or '>', and it also handles cases where the string contains only '<' or only '>'. The output is a sequence of numbers that reflect the structure of the input string.

Correctness: **True**
