Postcondition: ***r is decreased by 1, n is greater than i, i is increased by 1, the character at index i in string s is '<', the lengths of lists A and B are unchanged, the indices of '>' and '<' in s are unchanged, a is A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l, if r - l >= 0, b is B[r] minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) times (r - l). Otherwise, b is B[r].***
