Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1, `i` is `n-1-j`, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been updated to `n-1-j`, where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `j` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
