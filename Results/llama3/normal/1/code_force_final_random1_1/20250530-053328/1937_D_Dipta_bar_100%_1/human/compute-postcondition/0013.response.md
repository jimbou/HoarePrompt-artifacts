Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `idx_A` is empty, `A` is a list containing one element: 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of (`i` - the last element of `idx_A`) and the length of `idx_A`, and `idx_A` remains unchanged.***
