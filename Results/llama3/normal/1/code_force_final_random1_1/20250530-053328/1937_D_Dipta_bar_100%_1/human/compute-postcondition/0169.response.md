Based on the precondition, let's break down the variables and their values:

* `a` is `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`. This means `a` is the value at index `l - 1` in list `A`, plus the difference between the current index `i` and the index of the last element in `A` that is less than or equal to `i`, multiplied by `l`.
* `b` is calculated differently depending on the value of `r - l`. If `r - l >= 0`, then `b` is `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r]` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`.
* `i` is increased by 1, so its value is the current index plus 1.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')`

The expression inside the print statement is:

`a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`

This can be broken down as:

* `a * 2` is twice the value of `a`, which is the value at index `l - 1` in list `A`, plus the difference between the current index `i` and the index of the last element in `A` that is less than or equal to `i`, multiplied by `l`.
* `b * 2` is twice the value of `b`, which is either `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`, or `B[r]` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`, depending on the value of `r - l`.
* `i + 1` is the current index plus 1.

The `end=' '` argument means that the output will be followed by a space.

Output: **twice the value of a plus twice the value of b plus the current index plus 1, where a and b are calculated based on the values of l, i, idx_A, idx_B, A, and B, followed by a space**
