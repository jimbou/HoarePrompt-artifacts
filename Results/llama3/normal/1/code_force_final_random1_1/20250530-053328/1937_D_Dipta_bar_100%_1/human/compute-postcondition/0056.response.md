Postcondition: ***s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is at least 1, i is 0, idx_A is a list containing all the indices of '>' in s, A is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_A and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, B is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of B and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_B and the last element of idx_B and the length of idx_B, idx_B is a list containing all the indices of '<' in s, l is 0, r is the length of B, a is the first element of A, x is r - 2, if x is greater than or equal to 0, b is the last element of B minus B[x] and minus the product of the difference between idx_B[x] and idx_B[r - 1] and x + 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
