Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if len(idx_A) == 0:
            A.append(0)
        else:
            x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
            A.append(x)
        idx_A.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', then `idx_A` is a list containing 0 and `i`, and if `A` is not empty, then `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is the value of the last element of `A` plus the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`. If `idx_A` was empty, then `A` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `A` and `idx_A`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` is a list containing `i` and all the previous elements it had. If `idx_A` was empty before executing the code, `A` is a list containing one element: 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of (`i` - the last element of `idx_A`) and the length of `idx_A`. If `s[i]` is '<', no changes are made to `idx_A` and `A`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` contains the integer 2. If `idx_A` was empty, `A` is a list containing the integer 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`. If `s[i]` is '<', no changes are made to `idx_A` and `A`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
