Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, i is n-1, idx_A is a list containing all the indices of '>' in s, A is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_A and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, both of which assign empty lists to the variables B and idx_B, respectively. Since these lines do not modify any existing variables or create new ones, the state of the variables s, n, i, idx_A, and A remains unchanged. The only change is the addition of two new variables, B and idx_B, which are both empty lists.
