This function takes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and prints a sequence of numbers. The function calculates the numbers based on the indices of '<' and '>' characters in the string and their cumulative sums. For each character in the string, it prints a number that depends on the position of the character, the number of '<' and '>' characters before it, and the cumulative sums of these characters. The function handles cases where the string starts or ends with '<' or '>', and it also handles cases where the string contains only '<' or only '>. The output is a sequence of numbers that reflect the structure of the input string.
