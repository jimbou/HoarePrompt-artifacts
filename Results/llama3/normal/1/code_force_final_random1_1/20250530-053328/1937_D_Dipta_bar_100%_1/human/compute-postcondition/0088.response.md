Output: ** `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_B` and the last element of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' in `s`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` is the second last element of `B`, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1]` plus the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and `l`, and `b` is the value of `B[r]` plus the product of the difference between `idx_B[r]` and `i` and `l`. If `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is updated to the value of `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus the product of the difference between `idx_B[r - l]` and `i` and `r - l`. The value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed.**
