Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is at least 1, i is 0, idx_A is a list containing all the indices of '>' in s, A is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_A and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, B is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of B and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_B and the last element of idx_B and the length of idx_B, idx_B is a list containing all the indices of '<' in s, the current value of l is greater than the current value of r, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r).**

The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting the difference between the `l-r-1`th and `l-1`th elements of `A` and the product of the difference between the `l-1`th and `l-r-1`th indices of `idx_A` and the difference between `l` and `r`. The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `idx_A`, `A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged.
