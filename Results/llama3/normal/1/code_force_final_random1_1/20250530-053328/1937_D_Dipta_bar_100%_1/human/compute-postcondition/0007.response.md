Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>'. If `idx_A` is empty, then `A` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is the value of the last element of `A` plus the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`.***
