Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list.**

The code assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`, creates an empty list `A`, and creates an empty list `idx_A`. The string `s` remains unchanged, still consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The length of `s` is now stored in the variable `n`. The lists `A` and `idx_A` are empty, ready to be populated with values in future operations.
