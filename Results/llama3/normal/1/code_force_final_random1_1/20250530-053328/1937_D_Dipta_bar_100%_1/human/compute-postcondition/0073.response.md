Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_B` and the last element of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' in `s`. If `l` is less than `r`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed. If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, `n - i` is printed. If `r` is not 0, then if `l` is greater than `r`, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. The value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed.***
