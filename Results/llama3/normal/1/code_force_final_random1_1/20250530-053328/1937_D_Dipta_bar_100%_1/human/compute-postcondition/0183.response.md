Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the output state is determined by the final values of the variables in the loop head and body. The values of `s`, `n`, `idx_A`, `A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, and the values of `l` and `r` are determined by the number of '>' and '<' characters in `s`, respectively.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the output state is determined by the final values of the variables in the loop head and body. The input string `s`, its length `n`, the lists of indices of '>' and '<' characters `idx_A` and `idx_B`, and the lists `A` and `B` remain unchanged. The loop counter `i` has reached the length of the string `n`, and the values of `l` and `r` are determined by the number of '>' and '<' characters in `s`, respectively.
