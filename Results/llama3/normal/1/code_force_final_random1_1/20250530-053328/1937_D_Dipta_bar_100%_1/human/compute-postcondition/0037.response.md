Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is the length of s and is at least 2, i is 0, j is n, B is a list with one additional element x, x is the sum of the last element of B and the product of the difference between the last index of idx_B and i, and the length of idx_B, idx_B is unchanged.**

Note: The code snippet provided does not modify the variables s, n, i, or j. It only appends a new element to the list B and calculates its value based on the last element of B, the last index of idx_B, the value of i, and the length of idx_B. The state of idx_B remains unchanged.
