Postcondition: **The value of `a` remains unchanged, equal to the sum of the value at index `r-1` in list `B` and the product of the difference between the value at index `r-1` in list `idx_B` and `i`, and `r`. If `l - r > 0`, the value of `b` is the value at index `l-1` in list `A`, minus the value at index `l-r-1` in list `A`, minus the product of the difference between the values at indices `l-1` and `l-r-1` in list `idx_A` and `l-r`. Otherwise, the value of `b` remains unchanged, equal to the value at index `l-1` in list `A`. The values of `r`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged.**
