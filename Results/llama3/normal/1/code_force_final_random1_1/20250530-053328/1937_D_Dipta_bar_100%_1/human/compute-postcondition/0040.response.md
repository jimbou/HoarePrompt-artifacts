Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is `n`. If the first character of `s` is '<', `idx_B` has an additional element `i` appended to it, and if `idx_B` was empty, `B` is a list containing 0, otherwise, `B` is a list with one additional element `x`, where `x` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the last index of `idx_B` and `i`, and the length of `idx_B`. If the first character of `s` is not '<', no changes are made to `idx_B` and `B`.**
