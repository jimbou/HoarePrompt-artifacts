Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', then `idx_A` is a list containing 0 and `i`, and if `A` is not empty, then `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is the value of the last element of `A` plus the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`. If `idx_A` was empty, then `A` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `A` and `idx_A`.***
