Output: **`r` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `i` is increased by 1, the character at index `i` in string `s` is '<', the lengths of lists `A` and `B` are unchanged, the indices of '>' and '<' in `s` are unchanged, `a` is the value at index `r` in list `B`, `b` is the value at index `l - 1` in list `A`, plus the product of the difference between the current index `i` and the index of the last element in list `A` and the difference between the current index `r` plus 1 and the index `l`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is also minus the value at index `l - r - 2` in list `A`, and this is printed: a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), where a is the value at index `r` in list `B`, b is the value at index `l - 1` in list `A`, plus the product of the difference between the current index `i` and the index of the last element in list `A` and the difference between the current index `r` plus 1 and the index `l`, minus the value at index `l - r - 2` in list `A` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, and n is greater than i**
