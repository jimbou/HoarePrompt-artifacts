Output: **(2 * (the value of A at index l - 1 plus the product of the difference between i and the last element of idx_A and l)) + (2 * (the value of B at index r plus the product of the difference between idx_B[r] and i and l if r - l is less than 0, otherwise the value of B at index r minus B at index r - l minus the product of the difference between idx_B[r - l] and i and r - l)) + i + 1**
