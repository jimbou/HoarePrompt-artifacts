Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is `n`, `idx_B` has an additional element `i` appended to it, and if `idx_B` was empty, `B` is a list containing 0, otherwise, `B` is a list with one additional element `x`, where `x` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the last index of `idx_B` and `i`, and the length of `idx_B`.**

In this output state, the string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is still 0, and `j` is still equal to `n`. The list `idx_B` has been modified by appending the current value of `i` to it. If `idx_B` was initially empty, the list `B` now contains a single element, 0. Otherwise, `B` has an additional element `x`, which is calculated based on the last element of `B`, the last index of `idx_B`, and the length of `idx_B`.
