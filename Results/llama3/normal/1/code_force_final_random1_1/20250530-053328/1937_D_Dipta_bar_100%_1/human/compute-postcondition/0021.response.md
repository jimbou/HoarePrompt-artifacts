Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` contains the integer 2. If `idx_A` was empty, `A` is a list containing the integer 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`. If `s[i]` is '<', no changes are made to `idx_A` and `A`.***
