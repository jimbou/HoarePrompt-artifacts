Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', `idx_A` is a list containing 0 and `i`, and if `A` is not empty, then `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is the value of the last element of `A` plus the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`. If `idx_A` was empty, then `A` is a list containing a single element 0.**

In this output state, the value of `idx_A` has been updated to include the current index `i`, which is 0. The value of `A` has also been updated if it was not empty, by adding a new element `x` which is calculated based on the last element of `A`, the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A`, and the length of `idx_A`. If `idx_A` was empty, then `A` is a list containing a single element 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
