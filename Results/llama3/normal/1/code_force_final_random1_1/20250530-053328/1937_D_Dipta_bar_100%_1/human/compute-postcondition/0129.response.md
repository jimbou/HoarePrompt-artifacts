Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_B` and the last element of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' in `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the last element of `A` plus the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, and `b` is the `r`th element of `B` plus the product of the difference between the `r`th index of `idx_B` and `i` and `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the product of the difference between the `r`th index of `idx_B` and `i` and `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
