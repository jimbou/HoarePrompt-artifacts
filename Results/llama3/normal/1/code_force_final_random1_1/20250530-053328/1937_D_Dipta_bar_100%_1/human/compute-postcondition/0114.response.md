Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is at least 2, i is 1, idx_A is a list containing all the indices of '>' in s, A is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_A and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, B is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of B and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_B and the last element of idx_B and the length of idx_B, idx_B is a list containing all the indices of '<' in s, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1]**.

The code snippet assigns values to variables `a` and `b` based on the values of other variables in the initial state. The value of `a` is calculated as the sum of the last element of list `B` and the product of the difference between the last index of `idx_B` and the current value of `i` (which is 1), multiplied by `r`. The value of `b` is simply the last element of list `A`. These calculations do not modify any of the existing variables or lists in the initial state, but rather introduce two new variables `a` and `b` with specific values based on the initial state.
