Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n-1-j`, `j` is `n-1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still consists of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character. The length of `s` is still at least 3 and is represented by `n`. The value of `i` has been updated to be equal to `n-1-j`, where `j` is still equal to `n-1`.
