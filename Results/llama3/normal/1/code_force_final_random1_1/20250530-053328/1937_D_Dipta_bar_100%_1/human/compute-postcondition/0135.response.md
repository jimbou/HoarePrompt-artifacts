Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is at least 2, i is 1, idx_A is a list containing all the indices of '>' in s, A is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_A and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, B is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of B and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_B and the last element of idx_B and the length of idx_B, idx_B is a list containing all the indices of '<' in s, r is decreased by 1, a is the rth element of B, and b is the (l - 1)th element of A.**

The code snippet assigns the value of the rth element of list B to variable a and the value of the (l - 1)th element of list A to variable b. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
