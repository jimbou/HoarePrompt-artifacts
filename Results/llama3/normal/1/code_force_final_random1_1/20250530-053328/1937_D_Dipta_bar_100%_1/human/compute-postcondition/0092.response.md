The code prints the value of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.
Here, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`. Since `s` consists of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, and the character at index `i` of `s` is '<', `idx_A` is not empty and `l` is larger than `r`. Therefore, `idx_A[l - 1]` is the last element of `idx_A`, which is the index of the last '>' in `s`.
The expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` can be simplified as `n - idx_A[l - 1] * 2` since `i` is 0.
Output: **n - idx_A[l - 1] * 2 (where n is at least 1 and idx_A[l - 1] is the index of the last '>' in s)**
