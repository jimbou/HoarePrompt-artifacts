Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and n is greater than 0, A is a list with an additional element x, idx_A is a list and it is not empty, i is 0, and the current character at index i in string s is '>', x is the value of the last element of A plus the product of the difference between i and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A.**

In this output state, the string s and its length n remain unchanged. The list A has been modified by appending a new element x, which is calculated based on the last element of A, the difference between the current index i and the last element of idx_A, and the length of idx_A. The list idx_A remains unchanged, and the variable i remains at 0. The current character at index i in string s is still '>'. The new element x has been added to the end of list A.
