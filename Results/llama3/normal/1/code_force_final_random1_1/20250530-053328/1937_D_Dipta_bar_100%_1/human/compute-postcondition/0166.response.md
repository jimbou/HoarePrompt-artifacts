Output State: **r is decreased by 1, n is greater than i, i is increased by 1, the character at index i in string s is '<', the lengths of lists A and B are unchanged, the indices of '>' and '<' in s are unchanged, a is A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l, b is B[r] minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) times (r - l).**

The code snippet modifies the value of `b` by subtracting two expressions from it. The first expression, `B[r - l]`, is subtracted from `b` in the first line, effectively decreasing `b` by the value of `B[r - l]`. The second expression, `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`, is subtracted from `b` in the second line, further decreasing `b` by the product of the difference between `idx_B[r - l]` and `i`, and `r - l`. The values of `r`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `A`, `B`, `a`, and the indices of '>' and '<' in `s` remain unchanged.
