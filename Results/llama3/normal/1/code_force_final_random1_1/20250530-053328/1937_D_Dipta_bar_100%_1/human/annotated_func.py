    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the output state is determined by the final values of the variables in the loop head and body. The values of `s`, `n`, `idx_A`, `A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, and the values of `l` and `r` are determined by the number of '>' and '<' characters in `s`, respectively.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and prints a sequence of numbers. The function calculates the numbers based on the indices of '<' and '>' characters in the string and their cumulative sums. For each character in the string, it prints a number that depends on the position of the character, the number of '<' and '>' characters before it, and the cumulative sums of these characters. The function handles cases where the string starts or ends with '<' or '>', and it also handles cases where the string contains only '<' or only '>. The output is a sequence of numbers that reflect the structure of the input string.
