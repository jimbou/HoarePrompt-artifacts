Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1, `i` is `n-1-j`. If `s[i]` is '<', then `B` is a list where the last element of `B` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the last element of `idx_B` and `i` and the length of `idx_B`, and `idx_B` is a list containing `i` and all the previous indices of '<' in `s`. If `s[i]` is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
