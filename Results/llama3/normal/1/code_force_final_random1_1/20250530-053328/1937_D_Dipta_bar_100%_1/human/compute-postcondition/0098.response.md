Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_B` and the last element of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' in `s`, `l` is larger than `r`, `r` is the second last element of `B` and is not equal to 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is '<', `a` is the `r`th element of `B`, and `b` is the `(l - 1)`th element of `A`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is updated to its original value minus `A[l - r - 2]` and minus the product of the difference between `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 2]` and `(l - r - 1)`.***
