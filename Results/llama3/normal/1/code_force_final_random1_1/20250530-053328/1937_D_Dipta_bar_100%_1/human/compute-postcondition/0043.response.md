Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n-1-j`, `j` is `n-1`, `B` is a list with one more element 0 appended to it.**

In this output state, the values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. However, the list `B` has been modified by appending a new element, 0, to it.
