Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n-1-j`, `j` is `n-1`. If `idx_B` is empty, `B` is a list with one more element 0 appended to it. Otherwise, `B` is a list with one more element than before, the last element of `B` is `x` which is equal to the last element of `B` before the code execution plus (the last index of `idx_B` minus `i`) times the length of `idx_B`, `idx_B` is unchanged.***
