Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_B` and the last element of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' in `s`. If `l` is greater than `r`, then `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated based on the condition `l > r`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the value of `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. Otherwise, the value of `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
