Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_B` and the last element of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' in `s`. If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is the last element of `A`, `x` is the difference between the last index of `idx_B` and the second last index of `idx_A` minus 2, `b` is the last element of `B` minus `B[x]` and minus `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` if `x` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `b` is the last element of `B` minus `B[x]` and minus `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` plus `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`. If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the difference between `n` and `i` which is equal to `n - 1` is being printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, if `l - r` is greater than 0, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, where `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r` is greater than 0, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 1.***
