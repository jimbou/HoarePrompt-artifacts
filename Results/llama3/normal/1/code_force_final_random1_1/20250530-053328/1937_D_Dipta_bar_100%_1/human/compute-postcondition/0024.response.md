To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is the length of the string `s`, we can infer that `s` must have at least 1 character.

The variable `j` is initialized to 0, so we can set its initial value to 0.

The other variables, such as `s`, `i`, `idx_A`, `A`, `B`, and `idx_B`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0**
