Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1, `i` is `n-1-j`, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list, `idx_B` is a list, `j` is 0. The current value of `s[i]` is '<'. If the length of `idx_B` is 0, then `B` contains a single element 0. Otherwise, the last element of `B` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the last element of `idx_B` and `i` and the length of `idx_B`.***
