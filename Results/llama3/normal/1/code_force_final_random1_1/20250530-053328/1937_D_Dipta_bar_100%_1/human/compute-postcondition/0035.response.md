Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is `n`**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been updated to 0, since `i` is assigned the value of `n - 1 - j`, and `j` is equal to `n`. The values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code.
