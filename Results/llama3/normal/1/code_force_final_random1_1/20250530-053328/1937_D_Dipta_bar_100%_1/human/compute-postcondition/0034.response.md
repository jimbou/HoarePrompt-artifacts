The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be `n` and `n` must be at least 2.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 2, `i` is `n-1-j`, `j` is `n`**
