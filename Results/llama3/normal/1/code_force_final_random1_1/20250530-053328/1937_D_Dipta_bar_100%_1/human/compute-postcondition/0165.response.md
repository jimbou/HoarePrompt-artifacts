Output State: **r is decreased by 1, n is greater than i, i is increased by 1, the character at index i in string s is '<', the lengths of lists A and B are unchanged, the indices of '>' and '<' in s are unchanged, a is A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l, b is B[r].**

In this output state, the values of `r`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `A`, and `B` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only changes are the new values assigned to `a` and `b`. The value of `a` is now the sum of `A[l - 1]` and the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `l`. The value of `b` is now the value of `B[r]`.
