Based on the precondition, we can break down the variables and their values as follows:

* `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character.
* `n` is at least 2.
* `i` is 1.
* `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`.
* `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`.
* `B` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_B` and the last element of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`.
* `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' in `s`.
* `a` is the last element of `A`.
* `x` is the difference between the last index of `idx_B` and the second last index of `idx_A` minus 2.
* `b` is the last element of `B` minus `B[x]` and minus `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` if `x >= 0`, otherwise `b` is the last element of `B` minus `B[x]` and minus `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` plus `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')`

The expression inside the print statement can be broken down as follows:

* `a * 2` is the last element of `A` multiplied by 2.
* `b * 2` is the last element of `B` minus `B[x]` and minus `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` if `x >= 0`, otherwise `b` is the last element of `B` minus `B[x]` and minus `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` plus `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, multiplied by 2.
* `i + 1` is 1 + 1, which is 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output the sum of the last element of `A` multiplied by 2, the last element of `B` minus `B[x]` and minus `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` if `x >= 0`, otherwise `b` is the last element of `B` minus `B[x]` and minus `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` plus `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, multiplied by 2, and 2.

Output: **2 * (last element of A) + 2 * (last element of B - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) if x >= 0, otherwise last element of B - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)) + 2**
