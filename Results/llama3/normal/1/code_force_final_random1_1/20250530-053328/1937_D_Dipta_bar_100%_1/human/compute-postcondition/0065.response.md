Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is at least 1, i is 0, idx_A is a list containing all the indices of '>' in s, A is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_A and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, B is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of B and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_B and the last element of idx_B and the length of idx_B, idx_B is a list containing all the indices of '<' in s, l is 0, r is the length of B, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1].**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated according to the given code. The value of `a` is now the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the last index of `idx_B` and the current index `i`, multiplied by the length of `B`. The value of `b` is now the last element of `A`. All other variables remain unchanged.
