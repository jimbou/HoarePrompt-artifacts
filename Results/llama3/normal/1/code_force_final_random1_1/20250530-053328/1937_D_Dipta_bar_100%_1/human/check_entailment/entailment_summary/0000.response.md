Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query. The program uses two arrays, A and B, to store the cumulative sums of the indices of '<' and '>' characters in the string, respectively. It then uses these arrays to calculate the number of seconds for each query.

The program handles all possible cases, including when the string starts or ends with '<' or '>', and when the string contains only '<' or only '>'. The output is a sequence of numbers that reflect the structure of the input string, which is consistent with the problem description.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program produces the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
