Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is the length of s, i is -1, idx_A is a list containing all the indices of '>' in s, A is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_A and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, B is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of B and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_B and the last element of idx_B and the length of idx_B, idx_B is a list containing all the indices of '<' in s, l is 0, r is the length of B.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_B` and the last element of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' in `s`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', then `l` is increased by 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is '<', then if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, 1 is printed. Otherwise, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1]` plus the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and `l`, and `b` is the value of `B[r]` plus the product of the difference between `idx_B[r]` and `i` and `l`. If `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is updated to the value of `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus the product of the difference between `idx_B[r - l]` and `i` and `r - l`. The value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed. If `l` is larger than `r`, then if `r` is 0, this is printed: n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2. If `r` is not 0, then `a` is the `r`th element of `B`, `b` is the `(l - 1)`th element of `A` and is equal to its original value plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]` and `(r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is also equal to its original value minus `A[l - r - 2]` and minus the product of the difference between `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 2]` and `(l - r - 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program prints a value based on the conditions of the if-else block. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', the program prints a value calculated based on the indices of '>' and '<' in `s`, the lengths of lists `A` and `B`, and the values of `n` and `i`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '<', the program prints a value calculated based on the indices of '>' and '<' in `s`, the lengths of lists `A` and `B`, and the values of `n` and `i`, and also decreases the value of `r` by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program prints a value based on the conditions of the if-else block. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', the value of `l` is incremented by 1, and the values of `r`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '<', `r` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `i` is increased by 1, and the lengths of lists `A` and `B` are unchanged. The indices of '>' and '<' in `s` are unchanged. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the value of `i + 1` is printed. Otherwise, a calculated value based on the values of `A`, `B`, `l`, `r`, `i`, and `idx_A` is printed. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` equals 0, the value of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` is printed. Otherwise, a calculated value based on the values of `A`, `B`, `l`, `r`, `i`, and `idx_A` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
