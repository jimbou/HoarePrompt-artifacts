Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, i is n-1, idx_A is a list containing all the indices of '>' in s, A is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_A and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(0, n):
    i = n - 1 - j
    if s[i] == '<':
        if len(idx_B) == 0:
            B.append(0)
        else:
            x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
            B.append(x)
        idx_B.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1, `i` is `n-1-j`. If `s[i]` is '<', then `B` is a list where the last element of `B` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the last element of `idx_B` and `i` and the length of `idx_B`, and `idx_B` is a list containing `i` and all the previous indices of '<' in `s`. If `s[i]` is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is `n`. If the first character of `s` is '<', `idx_B` has an additional element `i` appended to it, and if `idx_B` was empty, `B` is a list containing 0, otherwise, `B` is a list with one additional element `x`, where `x` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the last index of `idx_B` and `i`, and the length of `idx_B`. If the first character of `s` is not '<', no changes are made to `idx_B` and `B`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n-1-j`, `j` is `n-1`. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list with one more element than before, the last element of `idx_B` is `i`, and `B` is a list with one more element than before, the last element of `B` is `x` which is equal to the last element of `B` before the code execution plus (the last index of `idx_B` minus `i`) times the length of `idx_B`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
