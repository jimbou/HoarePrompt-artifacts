Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 3, `i` is equal to `n-1-j`, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list with one more element than before, the last element of `idx_B` is `i`, `B` is a list with one more element than before, the last element of `B` is `x` which is equal to the last element of `B` before the code execution plus (the last index of `idx_B` minus `i`) times the length of `idx_B`.**

In this output state, the value of `idx_B` has been updated by appending the value of `i` to it. The value of `B` has also been updated by appending a new element `x` which is calculated based on the last index of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`. The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
