Output State: **The value of `l` is incremented by 1, and the values of `r`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `l` is increased by 1, while the values of `r`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain the same as in the initial state. The program's behavior and the conditions of the if-else block are not affected by this change, as they depend on the values of `l`, `r`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `A`, `B`, and `idx_B`, which are still the same.
