Postcondition: **a is the element at index l in list A, x is the difference between r and (l + 2), b is the last element in list B. If x is greater than or equal to 0, b is updated to be the last element in list B minus B[x] and minus the product of (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) and (x + 1). If x is less than 0, the values of a, x, and b remain unchanged.**
