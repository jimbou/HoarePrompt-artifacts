Output State: **`r` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `i` is increased by 1, the character at index `i` in string `s` is '<', the lengths of lists `A` and `B` are unchanged, the indices of '>' and '<' in `s` are unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decreased by 1, and the value of `i` has been increased by 1. The other variables, including `n`, `s`, `A`, `B`, and the indices of '>' and '<' in `s`, remain unchanged. The condition that `n` is greater than `i` is still valid.
