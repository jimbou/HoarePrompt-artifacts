Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is -1, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_B` and the last element of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' in `s`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length `n` of `s` remains unchanged, the index `i` is set to -1, the list `idx_A` remains unchanged, the list `A` remains unchanged, the list `B` contains the cumulative sums of the products of the differences between the indices of '<' in `s` and the length of the list of indices of '<' in `s`, and the list `idx_B` contains all the indices of '<' in `s`.
