Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list containing a single element 0, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', and the current length of `idx_A` is 0.**

In this output state, the list `A` has been updated to contain a single element 0, which was appended to it by the code. The other variables remain unchanged, with `s` still being a string of '<' and '>' characters, `n` being the length of `s` and greater than 0, `idx_A` being an empty list, `i` being 0, and the current character at index `i` in string `s` being '>'. The length of `idx_A` is still 0.
