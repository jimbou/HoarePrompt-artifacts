Output: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_B` and the last element of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' in `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the `r`th element of `B`, and `b` is the (`l` - 1)th element of `A` increased by the product of the difference between `i` and the (`l` - 1)th index of `idx_A` and (`r` + 1). If `l` - `r` - 1 > 0, `b` is decreased by the sum of the (`l` - `r` - 2)th element of `A` and the product of the difference between the (`l` - 1)th index of `idx_A` and the (`l` - `r` - 2)th index of `idx_A` and (`l` - `r` - 1). The expression a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) is printed, where a is the `r`th element of `B`, b is the (`l` - 1)th element of `A` increased by the product of the difference between `i` and the (`l` - 1)th index of `idx_A` and (`r` + 1), and n is at least 2 and i is 1.**
