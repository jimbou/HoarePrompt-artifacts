Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1, `i` is `n-1-j`, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list containing a single element 0, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0. The current value of `s[i]` is '<'. The length of `idx_B` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged. The index `i` is still calculated as `n-1-j`. The list of indices of '>' in `s`, `idx_A`, and the list `A` which is calculated based on `idx_A` also remain unchanged. The list `B` now contains a single element 0. The list `idx_B` is still empty. The value of `j` is still 0. The current character at index `i` in string `s` is still '<'. The length of `idx_B` is still 0.
