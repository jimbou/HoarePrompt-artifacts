The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `n`, so `j` is `n-1` and `n` must be greater than `n-1`, so `n` is at least 3.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is `n-1**
