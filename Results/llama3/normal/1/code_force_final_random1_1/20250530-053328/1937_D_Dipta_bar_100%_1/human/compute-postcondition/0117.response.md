Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_B` and the last element of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' in `s`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, if `l - r > 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `b` has been updated by adding the product of `i - idx_A[l - 1]` and `r`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
