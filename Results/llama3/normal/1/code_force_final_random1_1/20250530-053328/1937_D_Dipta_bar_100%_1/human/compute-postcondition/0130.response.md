The code prints the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where `a` is the last element of list `A` plus the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `b` is the `r`th element of list `B` plus the product of the difference between the `r`th index of `idx_B` and `i` and `l`, and `i` is 1.

Since the exact values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `r`, and `l` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **(2 * (last element of A + (i - last element of idx_A) * length of idx_A)) + (2 * (rth element of B + (rth index of idx_B - i) * l)) + i + 1 (where A, idx_A, B, idx_B, r, i, and l are as described in the precondition)**
