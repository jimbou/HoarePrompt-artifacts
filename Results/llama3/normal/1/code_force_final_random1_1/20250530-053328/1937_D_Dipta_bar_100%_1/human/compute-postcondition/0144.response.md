State: **The program prints a value based on the conditions of the if-else block. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', the program prints a value calculated based on the indices of '>' and '<' in `s`, the lengths of lists `A` and `B`, and the values of `n` and `i`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '<', the program prints a value calculated based on the indices of '>' and '<' in `s`, the lengths of lists `A` and `B`, and the values of `n` and `i`, and also decreases the value of `r` by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`**
