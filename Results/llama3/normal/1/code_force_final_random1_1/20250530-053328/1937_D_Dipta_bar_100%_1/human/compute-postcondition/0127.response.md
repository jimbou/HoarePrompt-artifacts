Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is at least 2, i is 1, idx_A is a list containing all the indices of '>' in s, A is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_A and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, B is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of B and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_B and the last element of idx_B and the length of idx_B, idx_B is a list containing all the indices of '<' in s, r is decreased by 1, a is the last element of A plus the product of the difference between i and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, and b is the rth element of B minus the (r - l)th element of B and minus the product of the difference between the (r - l)th index of idx_B and i and (r - l).**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been modified by the code. The first line subtracts the `(r - l)`th element of `B` from `b`, and the second line subtracts the product of the difference between the `(r - l)`th index of `idx_B` and `i` and `(r - l)` from `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
