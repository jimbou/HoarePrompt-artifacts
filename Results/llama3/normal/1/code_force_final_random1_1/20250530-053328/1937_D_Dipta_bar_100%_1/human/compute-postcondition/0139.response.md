The code prints the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, where `a` is the `r`th element of `B`, `b` is the (`l` - 1)th element of `A` increased by the product of the difference between `i` and the (`l` - 1)th index of `idx_A` and (`r` + 1), and `n` is at least 2.

Since the exact values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `idx_A`, `A`, `idx_B`, `B`, `r`, and `l` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a is the rth element of B, b is the (l - 1)th element of A increased by the product of the difference between i and the (l - 1)th index of idx_A and (r + 1), and n is at least 2)**
