Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `idx_A` contains the integer 2, If `idx_A` was empty, `A` is a list containing the integer 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`**

Explanation: The code `idx_A.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 2) to the end of the list `idx_A`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `A` depends on whether `idx_A` was empty or not. If `idx_A` was empty, `A` is a list containing the integer 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`.
