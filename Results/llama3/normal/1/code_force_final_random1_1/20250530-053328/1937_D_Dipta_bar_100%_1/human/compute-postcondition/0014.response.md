Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is a list containing `i` and all the previous elements it had, If `idx_A` was empty before executing the code, `A` is a list containing one element: 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of (`i` - the last element of `idx_A`) and the length of `idx_A`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains 1. The list `idx_A` now contains the value of `i` (which is 1) in addition to its previous elements. The list `A` has a new element `x` which is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of (`i` - the last element of `idx_A`) and the length of `idx_A`. If `idx_A` was empty before executing the code, `A` contains only one element which is 0.
