Postcondition: ***`r` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `i` is increased by 1, the character at index `i` in string `s` is '<', the lengths of lists `A` and `B` are unchanged, the indices of '>' and '<' in `s` are unchanged. If `l` is 0, the value of `i + 1` is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`, and `b` is either `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l` or `B[r]` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l` depending on whether `r - l >= 0` or not. Then, 2 times a plus 2 times b plus i plus 1 is printed.***
