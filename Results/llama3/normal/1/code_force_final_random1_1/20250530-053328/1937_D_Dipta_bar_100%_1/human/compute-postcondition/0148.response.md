Output State: **a is the element at index l in list A, x is the difference between r and (l + 2), b is the last element in list B plus the product of (idx_B[r - 1] - i) and (l + 1). If x is greater than or equal to 0, the previous value of b was the last element in list B minus B[x] and minus the product of (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) and (x + 1).**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as the element at index `l` in list `A`. The value of `x` also remains unchanged as the difference between `r` and `(l + 2)`. The value of `b` is updated to be the last element in list `B` plus the product of `(idx_B[r - 1] - i)` and `(l + 1)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, the previous value of `b` was the last element in list `B` minus `B[x]` and minus the product of `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1])` and `(x + 1)`.
