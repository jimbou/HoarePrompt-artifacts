Output: **a is the element at index l in list A, x is the difference between r and (l + 2), b is the last element in list B plus the product of (idx_B[r - 1] - i) and (l + 1). If x is greater than or equal to 0, the previous value of b was the last element in list B minus B[x] and minus the product of (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) and (x + 1), and this is printed: (2 times the element at index l in list A) + (2 times the last element in list B plus the product of (idx_B[r - 1] - i) and (l + 1)) + i + 1**
