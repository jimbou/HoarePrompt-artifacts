Postcondition: **The program prints a value based on the conditions of the if-else block. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', the value of `l` is incremented by 1, and the values of `r`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '<', `r` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `i` is increased by 1, and the lengths of lists `A` and `B` are unchanged. The indices of '>' and '<' in `s` are unchanged. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the value of `i + 1` is printed. Otherwise, a calculated value based on the values of `A`, `B`, `l`, `r`, `i`, and `idx_A` is printed. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` equals 0, the value of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` is printed. Otherwise, a calculated value based on the values of `A`, `B`, `l`, `r`, `i`, and `idx_A` is printed.**
