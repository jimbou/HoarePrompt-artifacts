Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_B` and the last element of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' in `s`, the character at index `i` of `s` is '<'. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, 1 is printed. Otherwise, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1]` plus the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and `l`, and `b` is the value of `B[r]` plus the product of the difference between `idx_B[r]` and `i` and `l`. If `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is updated to the value of `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus the product of the difference between `idx_B[r - l]` and `i` and `r - l`. The value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed. If `l` is larger than `r`, then if `r` is 0, this is printed: n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2. If `r` is not 0, then `a` is the `r`th element of `B`, `b` is the `(l - 1)`th element of `A` and is equal to its original value plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]` and `(r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is also equal to its original value minus `A[l - r - 2]` and minus the product of the difference between `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 2]` and `(l - r - 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`***
