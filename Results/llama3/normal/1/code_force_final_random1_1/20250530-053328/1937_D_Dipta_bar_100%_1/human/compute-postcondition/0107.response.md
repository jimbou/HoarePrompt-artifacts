Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is at least 2, i is 1, idx_A is a list containing all the indices of '>' in s, A is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_A and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, B is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of B and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_B and the last element of idx_B and the length of idx_B, idx_B is a list containing all the indices of '<' in s, a is the last element of A, x is the difference between the last index of idx_B and the second last index of idx_A minus 2, b is the last element of B minus B[x] and minus (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1).**

The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `B[x]` and `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from it. The value of `x` is used to index into `B` and `idx_B`, and the value of `r` is used to index into `idx_B`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
