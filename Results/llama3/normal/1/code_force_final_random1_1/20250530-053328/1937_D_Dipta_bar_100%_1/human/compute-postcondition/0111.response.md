Output: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is at least 2, i is 1, idx_A is a list containing all the indices of '>' in s, A is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_A and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, B is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of B and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_B and the last element of idx_B and the length of idx_B, idx_B is a list containing all the indices of '<' in s, a is the last element of A, x is the difference between the last index of idx_B and the second last index of idx_A minus 2, b is the last element of B minus B[x] and minus (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) if x >= 0, otherwise b is the last element of B minus B[x] and minus (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) plus (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1), and this is printed: a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1**
