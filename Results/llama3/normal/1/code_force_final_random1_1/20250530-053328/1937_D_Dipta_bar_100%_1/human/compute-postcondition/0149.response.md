The code prints the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where `a` is the element at index `l` in list `A`, `b` is the last element in list `B` plus the product of `(idx_B[r - 1] - i)` and `(l + 1)`, and `i` is an integer.

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `idx_B`, and the elements in lists `A` and `B` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **2 * (the element at index l in list A) + 2 * (the last element in list B + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)) + i + 1**
