Output State: **`r` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `i` is increased by 1, the character at index `i` in string `s` is '<', the lengths of lists `A` and `B` are unchanged, the indices of '>' and '<' in `s` are unchanged, `a` is `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`, if `r - l >= 0`, `b` is `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r]` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `r` is still decreased by 1, `n` is still greater than `i`, `i` is still increased by 1, the character at index `i` in string `s` is still '<', the lengths of lists `A` and `B` are still unchanged, the indices of '>' and '<' in `s` are still unchanged. The value of `a` is still `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` times `l`. The value of `b` has been updated to `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` times `(r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l` if `r - l >= 0`, otherwise it is `B[r]` plus `(idx_B[r] - i)` times `l`.
