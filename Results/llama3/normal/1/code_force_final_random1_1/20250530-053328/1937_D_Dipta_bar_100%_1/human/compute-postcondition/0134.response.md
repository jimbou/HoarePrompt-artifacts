Output: ** `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_B` and the last element of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' in `s`, and `r` is decreased by 1, and this is printed: n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, where n is at least 2, i is 1, and idx_A[l - 1] is the last element of idx_A which is the last index of '>' in s**
