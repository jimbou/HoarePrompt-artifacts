Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1, `i` is `n-1-j`, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `j`th index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`, `B` is a list where the last element of `B` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the last element of `idx_B` and `i` and the length of `idx_B`, `idx_B` is a list containing `i` and all the previous indices of '<' in `s`, `j` is 0.**

In this output state, the only change is that `idx_B` now contains the current index `i`, which is the index of the current '<' character in `s`. The last element of `B` has been updated to include the product of the difference between the last element of `idx_B` (which is `i`) and `i` and the length of `idx_B`. All other variables remain unchanged.
