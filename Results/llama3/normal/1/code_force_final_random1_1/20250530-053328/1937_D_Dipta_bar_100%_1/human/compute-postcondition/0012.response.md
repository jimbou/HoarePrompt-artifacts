Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and n is greater than 1, i is 1, A is a list with an additional element x, idx_A is unchanged, x is the sum of the last element of A and the product of (i - the last element of idx_A) and the length of idx_A**

The code block modifies the list A by appending a new element x, which is calculated based on the last element of A, the last element of idx_A, the value of i, and the length of idx_A. The value of x is the sum of the last element of A and the product of (i - the last element of idx_A) and the length of idx_A. The list idx_A remains unchanged. The variables s, n, and i retain their initial values.
