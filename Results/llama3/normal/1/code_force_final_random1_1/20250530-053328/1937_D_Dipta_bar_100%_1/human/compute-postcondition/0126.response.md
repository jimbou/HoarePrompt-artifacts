Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is at least 2, i is 1, idx_A is a list containing all the indices of '>' in s, A is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_A and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, B is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of B and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_B and the last element of idx_B and the length of idx_B, idx_B is a list containing all the indices of '<' in s, r is decreased by 1, a is the last element of A plus the product of the difference between i and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, and b is the rth element of B.**

In this final state, the string `s` and the lists `idx_A` and `idx_B` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The variable `n` is still at least 2, and `i` is still 1. The list `A` is updated by adding the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A` to its last element, and the list `B` is accessed at index `r`, which is decreased by 1. The variable `a` is assigned the updated value of the last element of `A`, and the variable `b` is assigned the value of the `r`th element of `B`.
