Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, n is at least 1, i is 0, idx_A is a list containing all the indices of '>' in s, A is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_A and the last element of idx_A and the length of idx_A, B is a list where each element at index j is the sum of the last element of B and the product of the difference between the jth index of idx_B and the last element of idx_B and the length of idx_B, idx_B is a list containing all the indices of '<' in s, l is 0, r is the length of B, a is the first element of A, x is r - 2, b is the last element of B.**

The code snippet assigns the first element of `A` to `a`, calculates `x` as `r - 2`, and assigns the last element of `B` to `b`. The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `idx_A`, `A`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
