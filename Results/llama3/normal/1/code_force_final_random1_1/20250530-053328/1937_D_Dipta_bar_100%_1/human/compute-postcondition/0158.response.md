Output: **The value of `a` remains unchanged, equal to the sum of the value at index `r-1` in list `B` and the product of the difference between the value at index `r-1` in list `idx_B` and `i`, and `r`. If `l - r > 0`, the value of `b` is the value at index `l-1` in list `A`, minus the value at index `l-r-1` in list `A`, minus the product of the difference between the values at indices `l-1` and `l-r-1` in list `idx_A` and `l-r`, plus the product of the difference between `i` and the value at index `l-1` in list `idx_A` and `r`. Otherwise, the value of `b` is the value at index `l-1` in list `A`, plus the product of the difference between `i` and the value at index `l-1` in list `idx_A` and `r`. The values of `r`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged. The following is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, where `a` is the sum of the value at index `r-1` in list `B` and the product of the difference between the value at index `r-1` in list `idx_B` and `i`, and `r`, `b` is the value at index `l-1` in list `A`, minus the value at index `l-r-1` in list `A`, minus the product of the difference between the values at indices `l-1` and `l-r-1` in list `idx_A` and `l-r`, plus the product of the difference between `i` and the value at index `l-1` in list `idx_A` and `r`, or the value at index `l-1` in list `A`, plus the product of the difference between `i` and the value at index `l-1` in list `idx_A` and `r`, and `n - i` is the difference between `n` and `i`**
