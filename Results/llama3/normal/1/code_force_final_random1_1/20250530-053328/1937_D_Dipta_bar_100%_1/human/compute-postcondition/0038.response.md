Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is `n`. If `idx_B` is empty, `B` is a list containing 0. Otherwise, `B` is a list with one additional element `x`, where `x` is the sum of the last element of `B` and the product of the difference between the last index of `idx_B` and `i`, and the length of `idx_B`, and `idx_B` remains unchanged.***
