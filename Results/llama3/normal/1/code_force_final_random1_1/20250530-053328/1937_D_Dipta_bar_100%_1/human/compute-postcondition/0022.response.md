Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `idx_A` is a list containing all the indices of '>' in `s`, `A` is a list where each element at index `j` is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between the `jth` index of `idx_A` and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged. The loop counter `i` has reached the last index of the string `s`. The list `idx_A` contains all the indices of the '>' characters in the string `s`. The list `A` contains the cumulative sums of the products of the differences between consecutive indices of '>' characters and the length of `idx_A`, starting from the first '>' character.
