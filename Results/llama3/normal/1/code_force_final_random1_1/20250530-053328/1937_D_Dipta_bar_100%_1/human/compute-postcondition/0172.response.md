The code prints the result of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. Let's break down the variables involved:

*   `n` is greater than `i`, so `n - i` will be a positive integer.
*   `i` has been increased by 1, but its exact value is not specified.
*   `idx_A[l - 1]` is an index in list `A`. Since the lengths of lists `A` and `B` are unchanged, and the indices of '>' and '<' in `s` are unchanged, the value of `idx_A[l - 1]` is also unchanged. However, its exact value is not specified.
*   `l` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on the context, it seems to be an index or a counter related to list `A`. Its exact value is not specified.

Considering these points, the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` will evaluate to a value that depends on the specific values of `n`, `i`, `idx_A[l - 1]`, and `l`. Since these values are not explicitly provided, we cannot compute an exact numerical value.

However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **(n - i) + 2 * (i - idx_A[l - 1]) (where n is greater than i, i is the current index, and idx_A[l - 1] is an index in list A)**
