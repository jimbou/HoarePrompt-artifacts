The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than n - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, n is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than 2, u2vs is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, v is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, _ is 2, stdin contains no input**
