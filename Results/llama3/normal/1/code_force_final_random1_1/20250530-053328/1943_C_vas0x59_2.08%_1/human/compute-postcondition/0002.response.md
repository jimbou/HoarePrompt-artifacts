Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, u2vs is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, v is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, _ is 0, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `u2vs` is updated to include the values `u` and `v` at their respective indices. The values of `u` and `v` are decremented by 1 as per the code. The value of `_` remains 0 as it is not modified by the code. Stdin remains empty as no input is provided.
