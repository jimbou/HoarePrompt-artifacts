Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `_` is n - 1, `a` is the result of func_1(d), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b and all the values of n until -1 is reached and must have at least 1 element, `d` is the result of bfs(a), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing a tuple (c, i), `ci` is half the length of path_ba and is at least 0, `c` is the middle element of path_ba, `i` is 0**

The code appends a tuple (c, i) to the list ops. The value of c is the middle element of path_ba, and the value of i is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The list ops now contains a single tuple (c, i).
