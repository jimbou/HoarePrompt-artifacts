This function reads input from the user, constructs a graph, performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two nodes, and then generates a list of operations based on the path. The function returns None, but it prints the length of the operations list and the operations themselves in a specific format. The operations list contains tuples of node values and indices, which are derived from the shortest path found by the BFS. The function handles both odd and even length paths, generating different operations lists accordingly.
