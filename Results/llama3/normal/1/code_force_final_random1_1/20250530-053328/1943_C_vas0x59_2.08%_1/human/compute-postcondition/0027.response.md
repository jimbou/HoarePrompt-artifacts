Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `_` is n - 1, `a` is the result of func_1(d), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b and all the values of n until -1 is reached, `d` is the result of bfs(a), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `n` is -1, and `ops` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain unchanged, and a new variable `ops` is introduced as an empty list. The list `path_ba` still contains the value `b` and all the values of `n` until -1 is reached, indicating that the loop has traversed the path from `b` to the end of the path. The value of `n` is still -1, indicating that the loop has terminated.
