Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `_` is n - 1, `a` is the result of func_1(d), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b and n, `d` is the result of bfs(a), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `n` is the value of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and relationships, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
