Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `_` is n - 1, `a` is the result of func_1(d), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b and all the values of n until -1 is reached, `d` is the result of bfs(a), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `n` is -1, `ops` is an empty list, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `c1` is half the length of `path_ba` minus 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: u2vs is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, v is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, _ is n - 1, a is the result of func_1(d), b is the result of func_1(d), path_ba is a list containing b and all the values of n until -1 is reached and has at least 3 elements, d is the result of bfs(a), previous is the result of bfs(a), n is -1, ops is a list containing ((c1, i), (c2, i)), c2 is half the length of path_ba, c1 is half the length of path_ba minus 1, and i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: u2vs is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, v is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, _ is n - 1, a is the result of func_1(d), b is the result of func_1(d), path_ba is a list containing b and all the values of n until -1 is reached and has at least 5 elements, d is the result of bfs(a), previous is the result of bfs(a), n is -1, ops is a list containing ((c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i)), c2 is half the length of path_ba, c1 is half the length of path_ba minus 1, and i is 3

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: u2vs is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, v is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, _ is n - 1, a is the result of func_1(d), b is the result of func_1(d), path_ba is a list containing b and all the values of n until -1 is reached and has at least 5 elements, d is the result of bfs(a), previous is the result of bfs(a), n is -1, ops is a list containing ((c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i)), c2 is half the length of path_ba, c1 is half the length of path_ba minus 1, and i is 5




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
