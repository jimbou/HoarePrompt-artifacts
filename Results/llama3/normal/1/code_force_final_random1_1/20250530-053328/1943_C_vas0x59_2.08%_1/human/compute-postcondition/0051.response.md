Output: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `_` is n - 1, `a` is the result of func_1(d), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b and all the values of n until -1 is reached, `d` is the result of bfs(a), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `n` is -1. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing ci + 1 tuples (c, i), where `ci` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`, and `i` is ci. Otherwise, `ops` is a list containing ((c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i)), where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is half the length of `path_ba` minus 1, and `i` is 7, and the following is printed: the list of operations `ops` where each operation is a tuple (c, i) where c is the element of `path_ba` and i is the index of the element in `path_ba`, and the elements of `ops` are printed in the format 'c + 1 i' separated by newline characters**
