The code prints the elements of the `ops` list, where each element is a tuple containing a value from the `path_ba` list and an index value. The elements are printed in a specific format, with each tuple printed on a new line.

Since the length of `path_ba` is not provided, we can't determine whether `ops` will contain tuples with a single value and index, or tuples with two values and an index. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of `ops` in the specified format.

Output: **A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a value from the `path_ba` list and an index value, printed in the format 'value index', with each tuple on a new line**
