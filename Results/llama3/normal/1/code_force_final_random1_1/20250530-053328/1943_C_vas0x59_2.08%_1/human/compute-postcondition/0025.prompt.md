Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, u2vs is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, v is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, _ is n - 1, a is the result of func_1(d), b is the result of func_1(d), path_ba is a list containing b, d is the result of bfs(a), previous is the result of bfs(a), stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `_` is n - 1, `a` is the result of func_1(d), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b and n, `d` is the result of bfs(a), `previous` is the result of bfs(a). If the current value of `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `u2vs` is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `_` is n - 1, `a` is the result of func_1(d), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b and n and n, `d` is the result of bfs(a), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), and if the value of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]` is -1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `u2vs` is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `_` is n - 1, `a` is the result of func_1(d), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b and n and n and n, `d` is the result of bfs(a), `previous` is the result of bfs(a). If the value of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]` is -1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
