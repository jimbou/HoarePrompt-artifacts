Output State: **u2vs is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, v is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, _ is n - 1, a is the result of func_1(d), b is the result of func_1(d), path_ba is a list containing b and all the values of n until -1 is reached, d is the result of bfs(a), previous is the result of bfs(a), n is -1, ops is an empty list, ci is half the length of path_ba, c is the middle element of path_ba.**

The code assigns half the length of `path_ba` to `ci` and the middle element of `path_ba` to `c`. No other variables are affected.
