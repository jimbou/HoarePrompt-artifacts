Output State: **n is an integer, u2vs is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, v is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, _ is n - 1, stdin contains no input**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` remains unchanged, the list `u2vs` has been updated to contain all the edges of the graph, where each edge is represented by a pair of indices `u` and `v` that point to each other in the list. The variables `u` and `v` have been updated to their final values, which are the input values minus 1. The loop counter `_` has reached its final value, which is `n - 1`. The standard input `stdin` remains empty.
