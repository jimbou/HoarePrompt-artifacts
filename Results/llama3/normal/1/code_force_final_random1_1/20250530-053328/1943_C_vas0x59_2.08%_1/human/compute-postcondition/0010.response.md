Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `_` is n - 1, `a` is the result of func_1(d), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b, `d` is the result of bfs(a), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `n` is the value of `previous` at index `path_ba[-1]`, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is updated to be the value of `previous` at the index of the last element in `path_ba`. All other variables remain unchanged.
