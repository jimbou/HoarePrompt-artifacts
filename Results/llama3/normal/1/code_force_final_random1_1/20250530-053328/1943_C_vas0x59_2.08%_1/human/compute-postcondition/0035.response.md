Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `_` is n - 1, `a` is the result of func_1(d), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b and all the values of n until -1 is reached and must have at least 3 elements, `d` is the result of bfs(a), `previous` is the result of bfs(a), `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing a tuple (c, i), the new tuple (c, i), and another tuple (c, i), `ci` is half the length of path_ba and is at least 1, `c` is the middle element of path_ba, `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `ops` now contains an additional tuple `(c, i)`, where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
