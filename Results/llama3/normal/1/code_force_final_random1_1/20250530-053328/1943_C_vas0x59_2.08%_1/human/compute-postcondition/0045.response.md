Output State: **u2vs is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, v is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, _ is n - 1, a is the result of func_1(d), b is the result of func_1(d), path_ba is a list containing b and all the values of n until -1 is reached and has at least 5 elements, d is the result of bfs(a), previous is the result of bfs(a), n is -1, ops is a list containing ((c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i)), c2 is half the length of path_ba, c1 is half the length of path_ba minus 1, and i is 5**

The code appends two new tuples to the `ops` list: `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`. Since `c1` is half the length of `path_ba` minus 1, and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `path_ba` has at least 5 elements, `c1` and `c2` are integers. The value of `i` is 5. The `ops` list now contains six tuples: `((c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i))`. No other variables are affected by the code.
