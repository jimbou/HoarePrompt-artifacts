Output State: **u2vs is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, u is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, v is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, _ is n - 1, a is the result of func_1(d), b is the result of func_1(d), path_ba is a list containing b and all the values of n until -1 is reached and has at least 5 elements, d is the result of bfs(a), previous is the result of bfs(a), n is -1, ops is a list containing ((c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i)), c2 is half the length of path_ba, c1 is half the length of path_ba minus 1, and i is 3**

The code snippet consists of two lines that append new elements to the `ops` list. The first line appends the tuple `(c1, i)`, and the second line appends the tuple `(c2, i)`. Since `c1` is half the length of `path_ba` minus 1, and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `i` is 3, the `ops` list now contains four tuples: `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `(c1, i)`, and `(c2, i)`. The values of `c1` and `c2` are determined by the length of `path_ba`, which has at least 5 elements. The other variables remain unchanged.
