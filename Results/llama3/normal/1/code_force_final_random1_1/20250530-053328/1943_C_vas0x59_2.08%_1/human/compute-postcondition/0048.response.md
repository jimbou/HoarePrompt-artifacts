The code prints the length of the `ops` list. To determine the length of `ops`, we need to consider the length of `path_ba`. Since `n` is -1, the length of `path_ba` is even (specifically, it is 0). Therefore, `ops` is a list containing ((c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i), (c2, i)), where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is half the length of `path_ba` minus 1, and `i` is 7.

Since `path_ba` has a length of 0, `c2` is 0 and `c1` is -1. Therefore, `ops` contains 8 tuples: ((-1, 7), (0, 7), (-1, 7), (0, 7), (-1, 7), (0, 7), (-1, 7), (0, 7)).

Output: **8**
