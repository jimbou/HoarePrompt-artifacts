Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of n lists, where the list at index u contains v and the list at index v contains u, `u` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `v` is an integer equal to its input value minus 1, `_` is n - 1, `a` is the result of func_1(d), `b` is the result of func_1(d), `path_ba` is a list containing b and n, `d` is the result of bfs(a), `previous` is the result of bfs(a)**
