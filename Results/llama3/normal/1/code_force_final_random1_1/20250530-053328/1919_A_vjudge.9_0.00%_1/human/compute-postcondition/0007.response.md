Output State: **t is 0, a is a positive integer equal to the last input, b is a positive integer equal to the last input, results is a list containing the results of func_1(a, b) for all inputs, stdin is empty, _ is t**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable t is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variables a and b are equal to the last input values, and the results list contains the results of func_1(a, b) for all input pairs. The stdin is empty, indicating that all inputs have been consumed. The variable _ is equal to the initial value of t, indicating that the loop has executed t times.
