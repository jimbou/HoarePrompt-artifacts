According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If the list has at least 2 results the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, results has at least 1 result, result is the first result in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 results and the result is the second result in the list.
State: **`t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer equal to the last input, `b` is a positive integer equal to the last input, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a, b)` for all inputs that must have at least 2 results, `result` is the second result in the list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is `t`, and the second result of `func_1(a, b)` which is the value of `result` is being printed**
