Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, a is a positive integer equal to the first input, b is a positive integer equal to the second input, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a, b) and the new result of func_1(a, b), stdin is empty, _ is 1**

The code first assigns the values of the first and second inputs to `a` and `b`, respectively. Since `a` and `b` were already positive integers equal to the first and second inputs, their values do not change. The `results` list already contained the result of `func_1(a, b)`, and the code appends the new result of `func_1(a, b)` to the list. The `stdin` remains empty, and the value of `_` remains 1. The value of `t` is not affected by the code and remains an integer greater than 1.
