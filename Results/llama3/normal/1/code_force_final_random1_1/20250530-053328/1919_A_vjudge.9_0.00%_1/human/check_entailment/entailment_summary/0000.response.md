Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets. The game involves exchanging wallets and removing coins, with the player who cannot make a valid move losing.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the winner based on whether their sum is even or odd. This function seems to be implementing a strategy for the game, but it does not explicitly model the game's rules.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads the number of test cases, iterates over each test case, and calls `func_1` to determine the winner. It then stores the results in a list and prints them.

The key to determining the correctness of the program lies in understanding the strategy implemented in `func_1`. The function returns 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even and 'Alice' if it is odd. This strategy is based on the observation that if the total number of coins is even, Bob will always have a valid move, whereas if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always have a valid move.

Given this strategy, the program is correct. The execution summaries of the functions provide evidence that the program behaves as expected. `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the sum of `a` and `b`, and `func_2` correctly iterates over test cases, calls `func_1`, and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
