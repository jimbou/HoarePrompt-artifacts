Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, a is a positive integer equal to the first input, b is a positive integer equal to the second input, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a, b), the new result of func_1(a, b), and the new result of func_1(a, b), winner is the result of func_1(a, b), _ is 2, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the first and second inputs, respectively, as they are reassigned using the `map` function. The `results` list is updated to include the result of `func_1(a, b)` three times, as the `append` method is called three times. The `winner` variable is assigned the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The `stdin` is empty as it is consumed by the `input` function.
