Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, a is a positive integer equal to the last input, b is a positive integer equal to the last input, results is a list containing the results of func_1(a, b) for all inputs, stdin is empty, _ is t
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is 0, a is a positive integer equal to the last input, b is a positive integer equal to the last input, results is a list containing the results of func_1(a, b) for all inputs that must have at least 1 result, result is the first result in the list, stdin is empty, _ is t, and the first result of func_1(a, b) which is the value of result is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer equal to the last input, `b` is a positive integer equal to the last input, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a, b)` for all inputs that must have at least 2 results, `result` is the second result in the list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is `t`, and the second result of `func_1(a, b)` which is the value of `result` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer equal to the last input, `b` is a positive integer equal to the last input, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a, b)` for all inputs that must have at least 3 results, `result` is the third result in the list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is `t`, and the third result of `func_1(a, b)` which is the value of `result` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
