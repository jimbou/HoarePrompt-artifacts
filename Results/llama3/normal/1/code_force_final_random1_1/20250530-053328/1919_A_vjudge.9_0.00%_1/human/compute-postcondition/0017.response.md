Output State: **t is 0, a is a positive integer equal to the last input, b is a positive integer equal to the last input, results is an empty list, stdin is empty, _ is t, and all results of func_1(a, b) have been printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations means that the loop has iterated over all the results in the `results` list and printed each one. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `stdin` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The `results` list is now empty, indicating that all its elements have been processed and printed. The variable `_` still holds the value of `t`, which is 0.
