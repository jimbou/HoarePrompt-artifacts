The only object in the loop head is variable  result and list results, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results.  If the list has at least 3 results the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, results has at least 2 results, result is the second result in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 results and the result is the third result in the list.
State: **`t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer equal to the last input, `b` is a positive integer equal to the last input, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a, b)` for all inputs that must have at least 3 results, `result` is the third result in the list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is `t`, and the third result of `func_1(a, b)` which is the value of `result` is being printed**
