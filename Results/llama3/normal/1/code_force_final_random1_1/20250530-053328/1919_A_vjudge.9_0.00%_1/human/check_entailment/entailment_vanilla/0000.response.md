Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move.

Function 1, `func_1(a, b)`, takes the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets as input and returns the winner of the game. The function uses the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets to determine the winner. If the sum is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Function 2, `func_2()`, reads the number of test cases and the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets for each test case. It calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner for each test case and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints the results.

The key insight here is that the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner. This is because the game is symmetric, and the players can always mirror each other's moves. If the sum is even, Bob can always make a move that leaves Alice with an even number of coins, forcing her to lose. If the sum is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an odd number of coins, forcing him to lose.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the output will match the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
