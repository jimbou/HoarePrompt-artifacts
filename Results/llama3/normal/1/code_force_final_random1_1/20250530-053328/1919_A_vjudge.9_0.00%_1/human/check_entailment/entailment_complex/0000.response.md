Reasoning:

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses. The game involves exchanging wallets and removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The problem also states that if both Alice and Bob play optimally, the winner can be determined.

Function 1 determines the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. This is a correct approach because if the sum is even, Bob will win, and if the sum is odd, Alice will win. This is because the game is symmetric, and the player who starts with the even sum will always have a valid move.

Function 2 reads the number of test cases and the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets for each test case. It then calls Function 1 to determine the winner for each test case and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints the results.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The program also handles multiple test cases correctly and prints the results as required.

Correctness: **True**
