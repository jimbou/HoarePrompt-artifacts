Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately determines the winner of the game based on the total number of coins in both Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly returns 'Alice' if the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, and 'Bob' if it is even. This is because if the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always make the last move by swapping wallets and removing a coin, while if the total number of coins is even, Bob can always make the last move by not swapping wallets and removing a coin.

The function `func_2()` correctly reads the input, calls `func_1(a, b)` for each test case, and prints the results.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
