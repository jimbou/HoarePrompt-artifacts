According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, and `stdin` contains 1 less input: the number of test cases has been consumed. For the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 1 less input: the number of test cases has been consumed, `_` is 0**
