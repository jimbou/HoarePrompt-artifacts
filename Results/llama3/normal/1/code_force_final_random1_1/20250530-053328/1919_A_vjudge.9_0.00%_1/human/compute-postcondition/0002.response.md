Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, a is a positive integer equal to the first input, b is a positive integer equal to the second input, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a, b), stdin is empty, _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the two positive integers input from stdin, which is now empty. The `results` list now contains the result of the function `func_1` called with the new values of `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
