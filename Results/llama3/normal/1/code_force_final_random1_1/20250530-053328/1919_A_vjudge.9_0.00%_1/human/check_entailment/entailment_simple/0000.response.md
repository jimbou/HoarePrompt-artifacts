Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move. The provided program uses a simple parity check to determine the winner.

Function 1 takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the winner of the game. It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', otherwise it returns 'Alice'.

Function 2 reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` and calls Function 1 to determine the winner. The result is appended to a list `results`. Finally, it prints all the results in the list.

The correctness of the program can be verified by analyzing the game's rules and the parity check used in Function 1. Since the game involves exchanging wallets and removing coins, the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` determines the winner. If the sum is even, Bob will always have a valid move, and if the sum is odd, Alice will always have a valid move. Therefore, the program correctly determines the winner of the game.

Correctness: **True**
