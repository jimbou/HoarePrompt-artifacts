Based on the precondition, the code will print the third result of the function `func_1(a, b)`, where `a` and `b` are positive integers equal to the last input.

Since the exact value of the last input is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the third result of the function `func_1(a, b)`.

Output: **the third result of func_1(a, b) (where a and b are positive integers equal to the last input)**
