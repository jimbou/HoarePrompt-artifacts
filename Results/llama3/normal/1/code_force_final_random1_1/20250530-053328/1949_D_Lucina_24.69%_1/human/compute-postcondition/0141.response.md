Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `a[i]` is 0. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of the list `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, then `nx` is a string containing one 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'S'. `nx` has been appended with 'F'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the string `nx` has been appended with the character 'F'. All other variables remain unchanged.
