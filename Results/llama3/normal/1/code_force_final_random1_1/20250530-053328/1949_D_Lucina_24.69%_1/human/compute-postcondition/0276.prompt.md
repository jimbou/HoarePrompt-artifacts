Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is n+1, `j` is n+1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. `sa` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `a[i]` is 0. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `sb` now contains all indices `i` from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:
            nx += 'S'
        else:
            nx += 'F'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is 1, `j` is n+1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. `sa` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `sb` now contains all indices `i` from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0. `nx` is a string of length n, which is either the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx` appended to its previous value or 'S' appended to its previous value or the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx` followed by 'F'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then if `i` is in the first quarter of the list `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, `nx` is a string containing 'S' and the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'F' and the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?'. If `i` is in the first quarter of the list `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, then `nx` has been appended with 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is now a string containing 'F' appended to its previous value or 'F' appended to its previous value followed by 'F', and `nx` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, xx is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, x is a string of length n, i is 2, j is n+1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. sa is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is greater than 0 and the value of b[i] is 0, and sb is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is 0 and the value of b[i] is 0. The length of sa is less than the length of sb. sb now contains all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is 0 and the value of b[i] is 0. nx is a string that contains the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx appended to its previous value if the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx is not '?'. If the character at index j-1 of the string at index i of xx is '?', then if i is in the first quarter of sb or j is in the first quarter of sb, nx is a string of length 1 containing 'S'. Otherwise, nx is a string containing 'F'. The value of nx has been updated by appending the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx to its previous value if the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx is not '?'. If the character at index j-1 of the string at index i of xx is '?', then if i is in the first quarter of sb or j is in the first quarter of sb, nx now has an additional 'S' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, nx is a string containing 'F' and an additional 'F' appended to its previous value, and nx is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer that is at least 1, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is 3, `j` is n+1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. `sa` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is greater than 0 and the value of b[i] is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is 0 and the value of b[i] is 0. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `sb` now contains all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is 0 and the value of b[i] is 0. `nx` is a string containing the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx` appended to its previous value if the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx` is not '?'. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, `nx` is a string containing 'S' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'F' appended to its previous value, and nx is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
