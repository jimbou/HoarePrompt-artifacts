Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the number of 'F's in the string x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the number of 'F's in the string x from index j to n. b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the number of 'S's in the string x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the number of 'S's in the string x from index j to n. xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n, i is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, j is n.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` will contain the count of 'F's in the string `x` from each index to the end of the string, and the list `b` will contain the count of 'S's in the string `x` from each index to the end of the string. The other variables remain unchanged.
