Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n+1`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `a[i]` is 0, `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]:
        nx += 'F'
    else:
        nx += 'S'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `a[i]` is 0. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string that is the concatenation of the empty string and the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, `nx` is a string containing 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `a[i]` is 0. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string that is the concatenation of the empty string and the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, `nx` is a string containing 'F' followed by 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'S' followed by 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `a[i]` is 0. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string that is the concatenation of the empty string and the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, `nx` is a string containing 'F' followed by 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'S' followed by 'S'. `nx` is now a string that is the concatenation of the previous value of `nx` and the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, `nx` is a string containing 'F' followed by 'F' and then 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'S' followed by 'S' and then 'S'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
