Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the second and third elements are 1 and the rest are 0 if the second character of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros. b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is 1 and the value at index j is 1 if the second character of string x is 'S', otherwise b is a list of n+1 zeros. xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n, i is 1, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, j is 1.***
