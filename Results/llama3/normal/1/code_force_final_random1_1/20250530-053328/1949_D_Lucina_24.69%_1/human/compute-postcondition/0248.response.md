To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 24.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is 3, `j` is n+1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. `sa` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is greater than 0 and the value of b[i] is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is 0 and the value of b[i] is 0. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `sb` now contains all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is 0 and the value of b[i] is 0. `nx` is a string that contains the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx` appended to its previous value if the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx` is not '?'. If the character at index j-1 of the string at index i of `xx` is '?', then if i is in the first quarter of `sb` or j is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is a string of length 1 containing 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'F'. The value of `nx` has been updated by appending the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx` to its previous value if the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx` is not '?'. If the character at index j-1 of the string at index i of `xx` is '?', then if i is in the first quarter of `sb` or j is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` now has an additional 'S' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'F' and an additional 'F' appended to its previous value, and `nx` is printed.**
