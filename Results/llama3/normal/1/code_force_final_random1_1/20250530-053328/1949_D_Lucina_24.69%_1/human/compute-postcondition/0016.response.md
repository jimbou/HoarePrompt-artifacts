The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the second element is 2 if the second character of string x is 'F', otherwise the second element is 1. The third element is 2 if the second character of string x is 'F', otherwise the third element is 1. The rest of the values in a are 0. b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is 1 if the second character of string x is 'F', otherwise the value at index 1 is 2. The value at index j is 1 if the second character of string x is 'F' or x[j - 1] is not 'S', otherwise the value at index j is 2. The rest of the values in b are zeros. xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n, i is 1, stdin contains n-2 inputs: strings of length n, j is 3.**
