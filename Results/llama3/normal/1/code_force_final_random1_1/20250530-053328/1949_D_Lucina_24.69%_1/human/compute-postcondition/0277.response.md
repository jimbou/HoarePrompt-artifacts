Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, xx is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, x is a string of length n, i is n+1, j is n+1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. sa is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is greater than 0 and the value of b[i] is 0, and sb is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of b[i] is greater than 0 and the value of a[i] is 0. The length of sa is greater than or equal to the length of sb. nx is a string of length n, where each character is either the character at the corresponding index in the string at index i in xx if it is not '?', or 'F' if i or the index is in the first n // 4 elements of sa, or 'S' otherwise, and nx is printed n times. If the length of sa is less than the length of sb, then sb now contains all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is 0 and the value of b[i] is 0. nx is a string of length n, which is either the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx appended to its previous value or 'S' appended to its previous value or the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx followed by 'F'. If xx[i][j - 1] is '?', then if i is in the first quarter of the list sb or j is in the first quarter of the list sb, nx is a string containing 'S' and the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx is '?'. Otherwise, nx is a string containing 'F' and the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx is '?'. If i is in the first quarter of the list sb or j is in the first quarter of the list sb, then nx has been appended with 'S'. Otherwise, nx is now a string containing 'F' appended to its previous value or 'F' appended to its previous value followed by 'F', and nx is printed.***
