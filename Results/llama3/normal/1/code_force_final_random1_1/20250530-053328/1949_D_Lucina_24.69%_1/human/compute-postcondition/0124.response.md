Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, xx is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, x is a string of length n, i is 1, j is n+1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. sa is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is greater than 0 and the value of b[i] is 0, and sb is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of b[i] is greater than 0 and the value of a[i] is 0. The current value of sa has a length greater than or equal to the length of sb. If the current value of a[i] is 0 and the current value of b[i] is 0, then the value of i has been appended to sa, n must be greater than 0. nx is a string of length n, where each character is either the character at the corresponding index in the string at index i in xx if it is not '?', or 'F' if i or the index is in the first n // 4 elements of sa, or 'S' otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `nx` is a string of length `n`, where each character is determined by the corresponding character in the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If the character is '?', then if `i` or the index is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
