The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and n. If j is less than n+1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 1 and n is between 2 and 24. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1, so j is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the second and third elements are 1 and the rest are 0 if the second character of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros. b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is 1 and the value at index j is 1 if the second character of string x is 'S', otherwise b is a list of n+1 zeros. xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n, i is 1, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, j is 2.**
