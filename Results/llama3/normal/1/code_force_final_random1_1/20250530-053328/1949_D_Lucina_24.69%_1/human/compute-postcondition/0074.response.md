Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is 1, `j` is n+1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the current value of `a[i]` is 0. `sa` is an empty list and `sb` is a list containing the value 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains between 2 and 24. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, still containing the total number of 'F's and 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, respectively. The list `xx` remains unchanged, containing an empty string and n strings x of length n. The string `x` remains unchanged, still having a length of n. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, still being 1 and n+1, respectively. The stdin remains empty, containing no inputs. The current value of `b[i]` is still greater than 0 and the current value of `a[i]` is still 0. The list `sa` remains empty, and the list `sb` now contains the value 1.
