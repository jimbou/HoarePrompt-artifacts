Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the final state of the transition videos based on the input strings. The program first counts the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each index, and then determines which type of transition is more frequent. It then replaces the '?' characters with the more frequent type of transition, following the rules specified in the problem description. The program also handles the case where the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions is equal, and replaces the '?' characters with 'F' in this case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the rules specified in the problem description. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
