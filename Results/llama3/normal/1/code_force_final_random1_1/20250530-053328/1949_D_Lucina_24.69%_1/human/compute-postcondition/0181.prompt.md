Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is n+1, `j` is n+1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. `sa` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `a[i]` is 0. The current value of `sa` has a length greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0 and the current value of `b[i]` is 0, then the value of `i` has been appended to `sa`.

The loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), and in each iteration, it checks if the current index i has both a[i] and b[i] equal to 0. If this condition is true, it appends the index i to the list sa. After the loop finishes executing all iterations, the value of i will be n+1, and the list sa will contain all indices from 1 to n where both a[i] and b[i] are 0. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, xx is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, x is a string of length n, i is 1, j is n+1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. sa is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is greater than 0 and the value of b[i] is 0, and sb is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of b[i] is greater than 0 and the value of a[i] is 0. The current value of sa has a length greater than or equal to the length of sb. If the current value of a[i] is 0 and the current value of b[i] is 0, then the value of i has been appended to sa, n must be greater than 0. nx is a string of length n, where each character is either the character at the corresponding index in the string at index i in xx if it is not '?', or 'F' if i or the index is in the first n // 4 elements of sa, or 'S' otherwise, and nx is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n+1`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `a[i]` is 0. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` appended to its previous value. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then if `i` is in the first quarter of the list `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, `nx` is a string containing one 'F' followed by 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'S' followed by 'S', and `nx` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n+1`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `a[i]` is 0. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string that is the concatenation of the empty string and the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, `nx` is a string containing 'F' repeated `n` times. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'S' repeated `n` times, and `nx` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
