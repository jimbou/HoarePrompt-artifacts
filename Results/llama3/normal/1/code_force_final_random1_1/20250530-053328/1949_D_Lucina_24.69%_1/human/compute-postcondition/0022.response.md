Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of 'F's in the string `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the number of 'F's in the string `x` from index `j` to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of 'S's in the string `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the number of 'S's in the string `x` from index `j` to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the string `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `xx` now contains two elements: an empty string and the string `x` of length `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
