Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. `sa` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `sb` now contains all indices `i` from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0. If the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string that contains the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx`. If the character at index j-1 of the string at index i of `xx` is '?', then if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is a string of length 1 containing 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'F'.***
