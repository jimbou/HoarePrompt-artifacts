Output State: **`n` is an integer that is at least 1, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. `sa` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is greater than 0 and the value of b[i] is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is 0 and the value of b[i] is 0. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `sb` now contains all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is 0 and the value of b[i] is 0. `nx` is a string containing 'S' appended to its previous value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `nx` has been updated by appending 'S' to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
