Precondition: **stdin contains n+1 inputs: the first input is an integer n (2 <= n <= 24), and the next n inputs are strings of length n. Each string contains characters '.', 'F', 'S', or '?', where '.' represents the same scenario, 'F' represents a funny transition video, 'S' represents a scary transition video, and '?' represents an undecided transition video. The number of 'F' and 'S' characters in all strings does not exceed floor(n/2). The i-th character of the j-th string and the j-th character of the i-th string are the same for all i and j.**
