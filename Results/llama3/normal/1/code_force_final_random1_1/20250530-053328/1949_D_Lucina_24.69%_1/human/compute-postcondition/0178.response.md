Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n+1`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `a[i]` is 0. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string that is the concatenation of the empty string and the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, `nx` is a string containing 'F' repeated `n` times. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'S' repeated `n` times.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `j` has reached the value `n+1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The string `nx` has been constructed by iterating over the characters in the string at index `i` in `xx`. If a character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If a character is '?', then if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx` repeatedly for `n` times. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx` repeatedly for `n` times. The other variables remain unchanged.
