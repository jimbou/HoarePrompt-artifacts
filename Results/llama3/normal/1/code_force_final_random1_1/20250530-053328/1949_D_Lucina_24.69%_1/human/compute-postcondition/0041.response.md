Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of 'F's in the string `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the number of 'F's in the string `x` from index `j` to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of 'S's in the string `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the number of 'S's in the string `x` from index `j` to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the string `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, and `x` is assigned the value of the input string of length `n`. If the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', then `b[i]` and `b[j]` are incremented by 1. If the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'S', then no changes are made to `a` and `b`.**
