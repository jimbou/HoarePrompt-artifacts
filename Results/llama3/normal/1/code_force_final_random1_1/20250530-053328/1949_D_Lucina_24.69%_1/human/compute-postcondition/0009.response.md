Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 zeros, xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n, i is 1, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, j is 1, the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F'. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is 1 and the value at index j is 1. Otherwise, b is a list of n+1 zeros.***
