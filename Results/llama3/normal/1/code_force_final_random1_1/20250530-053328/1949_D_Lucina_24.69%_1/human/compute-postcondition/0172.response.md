The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'F's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the total number of 'S's in all strings `x` from index `j` to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where the value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `a[i]` is 0. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string that is the concatenation of the empty string and the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, `nx` is a string containing 'F' followed by 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'S' followed by 'S'.**
