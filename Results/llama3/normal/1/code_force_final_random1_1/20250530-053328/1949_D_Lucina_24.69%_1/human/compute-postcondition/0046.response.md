Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of 'F's in the string `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the number of 'F's in the string `x` from index `j` to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of 'S's in the string `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the number of 'S's in the string `x` from index `j` to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x` of length `n` and the string `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n+1`, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, and `x` is assigned the value of the input string of length `n`. If the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', then `a[i]` and `a[j]` are incremented by 1. If the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', then `b[i]` and `b[j]` are incremented by 1. If the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then no changes are made to `a` and `b`.**

The code assigns the value of the input string of length `n` to `x`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains 0 inputs. The character at index `j-1` of string `x` is checked, and if it is 'F', `a[i]` and `a[j]` are incremented by 1. If it is 'S', `b[i]` and `b[j]` are incremented by 1. If it is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes are made to `a` and `b`.
