Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the second element is 2, the third element is 2 if the second character of string x is 'F', otherwise the third element is 1, and the rest are 0, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is 1 and the value at index j is 1 if the second character of string x is 'S', otherwise b is a list of n+1 zeros, xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n, i is 1, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, j is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` and `a[j]` has been incremented by 1. The value of `a[i]` is now 2, and the value of `a[j]` is 2 if the second character of string `x` is 'F', otherwise it is 1. The rest of the elements in list `a` remain 0. The values of `b`, `xx`, `x`, `i`, `stdin`, and `j` remain unchanged.
