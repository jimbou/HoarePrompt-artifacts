Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is n+1, `j` is n+1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. `sa` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `a[i]` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `sa` will contain all the indices where there are more 'F's than 'S's in the strings from that index to the end, and `sb` will contain all the indices where there are more 'S's than 'F's in the strings from that index to the end. The other variables remain unchanged.
