This function takes as input a series of strings representing transition videos, where each string contains characters '.', 'F', 'S', or '?', indicating the type of transition video. The function then processes these strings to determine the final state of the transition videos. If the number of 'F' transitions is greater than or equal to the number of 'S' transitions, the function replaces all '?' characters with 'F' if the index is in the first quarter of the list of 'F' transitions, and with 'S' otherwise. If the number of 'S' transitions is greater than the number of 'F' transitions, the function replaces all '?' characters with 'S' if the index is in the first quarter of the list of 'S' transitions, and with 'F' otherwise. The function then prints the final state of the transition videos.
