Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the final state of the transition videos based on the input strings. The program first counts the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each index, and then uses this information to decide how to replace the '?' characters. If the number of 'F' transitions is greater than or equal to the number of 'S' transitions, it replaces '?' with 'F' if the index is in the first quarter of the list of 'F' transitions, and with 'S' otherwise. If the number of 'S' transitions is greater than the number of 'F' transitions, it replaces '?' with 'S' if the index is in the first quarter of the list of 'S' transitions, and with 'F' otherwise. This logic ensures that the final state of the transition videos satisfies the condition that no more than ceil(3n/4) transitions of the same type are consecutive.

Correctness: **True**
