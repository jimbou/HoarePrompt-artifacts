Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, xx is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, x is a string of length n, i is n+1, j is n+1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. sa is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of a[i] is greater than 0 and the value of b[i] is 0, and sb is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of b[i] is greater than 0 and the value of a[i] is 0. The current value of sa has a length greater than or equal to the length of sb. If the current value of a[i] is 0 and the current value of b[i] is 0, then the value of i has been appended to sa. nx is a string of length n, where each character is either the character at the corresponding index in the string at index i in xx if it is not '?', or 'F' if i or the index is in the first n // 4 elements of sa, or 'S' otherwise, and nx is printed n times.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has iterated from 1 to n (inclusive), and in each iteration, it has checked if the current index i has both a[i] and b[i] equal to 0. If this condition is true, it has appended the index i to the list sa. After the loop finishes executing all iterations, the value of i will be n+1, and the list sa will contain all indices from 1 to n where both a[i] and b[i] are 0. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The loop has also printed nx, a string of length n, n times, where each character is either the character at the corresponding index in the string at index i in xx if it is not '?', or 'F' if i or the index is in the first n // 4 elements of sa, or 'S' otherwise.
