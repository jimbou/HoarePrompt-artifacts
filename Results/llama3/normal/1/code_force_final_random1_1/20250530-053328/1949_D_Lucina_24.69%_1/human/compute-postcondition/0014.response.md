Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the second and third elements are 1 and the rest are 0 if the second character of string x is 'F', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros. b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is 1 if the second character of string x is 'F', otherwise the value at index 1 is 2. The value at index j is 2 if the second character of string x is 'S' and x[j - 1] == 'S', otherwise the value at index j is 1. The rest of the values in b are zeros. xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n, i is 1, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, j is 2.***
