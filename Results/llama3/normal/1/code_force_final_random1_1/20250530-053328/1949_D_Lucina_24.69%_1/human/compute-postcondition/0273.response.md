The code prints the string `nx` which is constructed based on the characters at index `j-1` of the strings in the list `xx`. The string `nx` is built by appending characters to its previous value. If the character at index `j-1` of a string in `xx` is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If the character is '?', the value of `i` or `j` is checked against the list `sb`. If `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.

Since the exact strings in `xx` and the values of `i` and `j` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `nx`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the constructed string `nx`.

Output: **nx (where nx is the constructed string based on the characters at index j-1 of the strings in the list xx and the values of i and j)**
