Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, the string `x` of length `n`, the string `x` of length `n`, and the string `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n+1`, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`. If the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', then the value at index `i` of list `a` is incremented by 1 and the value at index `j` of list `a` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F', then if the character at index 0 of string `x` is 'S', the value at index 3 of list `b` is incremented by 1 and the value at index 1 of list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

The code `xx.append(x)` adds the string `x` to the end of the list `xx`. This does not change the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `i`, or `j`. The list `xx` now contains four elements: an empty string, the string `x` of length `n`, the string `x` of length `n`, and the string `x` of length `n`. The other conditions regarding the values of `a` and `b` based on the characters in string `x` remain the same.
