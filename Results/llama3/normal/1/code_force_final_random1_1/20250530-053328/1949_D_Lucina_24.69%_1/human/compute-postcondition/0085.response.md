Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is 3, `j` is n+1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the current value of `b[i]` is 0, then `sa` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 3 and `sb` is a list containing the values 2, 3. If the current value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `sa` is an empty list and `sb` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 3, 3. Otherwise, `sa` is a list containing the value 3 and `sb` is a list containing the values 2, 3.***
