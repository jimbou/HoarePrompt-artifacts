Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string, the string x of length n and the string x of length n, x is a string of length n, i is 3, j is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', then the value at index i of list a is incremented by 1 and the value at index j of list a is incremented by 1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is not 'F', then if the character at index 0 of string x is 'S', the value at index 3 of list b is incremented by 1 and the value at index 1 of list b is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
