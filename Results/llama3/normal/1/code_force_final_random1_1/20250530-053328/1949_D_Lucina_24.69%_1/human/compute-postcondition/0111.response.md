Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. `sa` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `a[i]` is 0. The current value of `sa` has a length greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. If the current value of `a[i]` is 0 and the current value of `b[i]` is 0, then the value of `i` has been appended to `sa`, `n` must be greater than 0. If the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx`. If the character at index j-1 of the string at index i of `xx` is '?', then if `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, `nx` is a string containing one 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'S'.**
