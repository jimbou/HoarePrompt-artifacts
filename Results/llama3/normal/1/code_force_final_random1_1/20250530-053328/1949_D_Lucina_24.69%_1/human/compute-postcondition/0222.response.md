Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is 2, `j` is n+1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. `sa` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `sb` now contains all indices `i` from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0. `nx` is an empty string.**

The code has reset the value of `nx` to an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged.
