The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 2 and 24 does ensure that the loop will execute , so it does not need to be adjusted. But j is not in the state, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of 'F's in the string `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the number of 'F's in the string `x` from index `j` to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of 'S's in the string `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the number of 'S's in the string `x` from index `j` to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the string `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, and `x` is assigned the value of the input string of length `n`.**
