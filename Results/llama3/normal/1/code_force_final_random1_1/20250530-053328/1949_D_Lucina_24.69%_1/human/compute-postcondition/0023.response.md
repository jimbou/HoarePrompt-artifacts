To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 24. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same.

The other variables `a`, `b`, `xx`, and `x` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of 'F's in the string `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the number of 'F's in the string `x` from index `j` to `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the number of 'S's in the string `x` from index `i` to `n`, and the value at index `j` is the number of 'S's in the string `x` from index `j` to `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the string `x` of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`.**
