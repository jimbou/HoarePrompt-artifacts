Output State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'F's in all strings x from index j to n, `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index i to n, and the value at index j is the total number of 'S's in all strings x from index j to n, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings x of length n, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is n+1, `j` is n+1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n. `sa` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` is a list containing all indices i from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `sb` now contains all indices `i` from 1 to n where the value of `a[i]` is 0 and the value of `b[i]` is 0. `nx` is a string of length n, which is either the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx` appended to its previous value or 'S' appended to its previous value or the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in `xx` followed by 'F'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then if `i` is in the first quarter of the list `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, `nx` is a string containing 'S' and the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'F' and the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?'. If `i` is in the first quarter of the list `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, then `nx` has been appended with 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is now a string containing 'F' appended to its previous value or 'F' appended to its previous value followed by 'F', and `nx` is printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables `i` and `j` have reached their final values of `n+1`. The string `nx` has been fully constructed and printed, and its value depends on the values of `xx[i][j-1]`, `i`, and `j` during each iteration of the loop. If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', then `nx` contains the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', then if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, `nx` contains 'S', otherwise it contains 'F'. The other variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `x`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged.
