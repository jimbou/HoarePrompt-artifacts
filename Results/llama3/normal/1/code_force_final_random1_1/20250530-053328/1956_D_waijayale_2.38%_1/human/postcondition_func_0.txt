This function modifies a list of non-negative integers by recursively checking and updating segments of the list. It takes four parameters: a list `a`, and three non-negative integers `l`, `r`, and `ops`. The function ensures that all elements in the list between indices `l` and `r` (inclusive) are equal to the length of this segment (`r - l + 1`). If any element in this range does not match this condition, the function records the operation in the `ops` list and updates the elements in the range to the correct value. The function returns no value, as it modifies the input list in-place.
