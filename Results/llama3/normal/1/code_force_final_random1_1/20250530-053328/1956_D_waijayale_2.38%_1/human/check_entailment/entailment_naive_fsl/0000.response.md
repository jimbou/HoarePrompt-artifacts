Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly handle the case when the maximum sum of elements can be achieved by performing operations on non-contiguous subarrays. The program only considers contiguous subarrays and tries to maximize the sum by replacing the elements in the subarray with the length of the subarray. However, this approach may not always lead to the maximum sum.

For example, consider the input array [1, 100, 2, 1]. The program will first replace the subarray [1, 100] with [2, 2], and then replace the subarray [2, 2] with [2, 2]. However, this will not lead to the maximum sum. The correct approach would be to replace the subarray [1, 100] with [2, 2] and then replace the subarray [2, 1] with [2, 2], which will lead to the maximum sum of 105.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
