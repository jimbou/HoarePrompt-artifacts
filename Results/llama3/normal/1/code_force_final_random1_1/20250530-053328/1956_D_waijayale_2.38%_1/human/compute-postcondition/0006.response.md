The only objects in the loop head are variables  `l`, `r` and list `ops`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the ops.  If the list has at least 2 pairs the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, ops has at least 1 pair, `l` is the first element of the first pair in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the first pair in `ops`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 pairs and the `l` is the first element of the second pair in `ops` and `r` is the second element of the second pair in `ops`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `l` is the first element of the second pair in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the second pair in `ops`, stdin is empty, and the sum of the elements in `a` which is `s` and the maximum element in `a` which is `m` are being printed, and this is printed: l + 1 and r + 1**
