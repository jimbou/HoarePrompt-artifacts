Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, computing x as the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set {a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}, and simultaneously setting a_l := x, a_{l+1} := x, ..., a_r := x.

The program uses a recursive approach to maximize the sum of elements in the array. It first checks if the sum of the elements in the current range [l, r] is less than or equal to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1). If it is, the program sets all elements in the range [l, r] to r - l + 1 and adds the operation (l, r) to the list of operations. If the sum is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), the program finds the maximum element in the range [l, r] and recursively calls the function on the subranges [l, pos - 1] and [pos + 1, r], where pos is the index of the maximum element.

The program also uses a helper function func_1 to perform the operation of setting all elements in a range to a specific value.

The main function func_4 reads the input from stdin, calls the function func_2 to maximize the sum of elements in the array, and prints the maximum sum and the list of operations.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the recursive approach to maximize the sum of elements in the array and performs the required operations.

Correctness: **True**
