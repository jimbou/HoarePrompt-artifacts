Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers, s is the sum of the elements in a, m is the maximum element in a, ops is the number of operations performed by func_2 on a, stdin is empty**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, it is now equal to the length of the list that will be input in the next line. The second line assigns a list of non-negative integers from stdin to `a`. Stdin is now empty. The third line calls the function `func_2` with `a` as an argument and assigns the returned values to `s`, `m`, and `ops`. Since `func_2` is not defined in the given code, we assume it calculates the sum of the elements in `a` and assigns it to `s`, the maximum element in `a` and assigns it to `m`, and the number of operations performed on `a` and assigns it to `ops`.
