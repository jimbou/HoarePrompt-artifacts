Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, computing x as MEX({a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}), and simultaneously setting a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, ..., a_r:=x.

The program consists of four functions: func_1, func_2, recursive_maximize_sum, and func_3. 

- func_1 modifies a list of non-negative integers by recursively checking and updating segments of the list. It ensures that all elements in the list between indices l and r (inclusive) are equal to the length of this segment (r - l + 1). If any element in this range does not match this condition, the function records the operation in the ops list and updates the elements in the range to the correct value.

- func_2 calculates the sum of all non-negative integers in a given list 'a' and returns the sum along with an empty list 'ops' and its length, which is 0. However, this function does not perform any operations that affect external state.

- recursive_maximize_sum modifies the list 'a' by either setting all elements from index l to r to r - l + 1 if the sum of these elements is less than or equal to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), or recursively maximizing the sum of the elements in the sublists a[l:pos] and a[pos+1:r+1] if the sum is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), where pos is the index of the maximum value in the sublist a[l:r+1].

- func_3 reads a positive integer and a list of non-negative integers from standard input, calculates the sum and maximum of the list, and prints these values along with pairs of integers.

However, there seems to be a logical error in the program. In func_2, it simply calculates the sum of the list 'a' and returns it along with an empty list 'ops' and its length, which is 0. But it does not perform any operations that affect external state. It does not call the recursive_maximize_sum function which is responsible for maximizing the sum of the elements in the list 'a'. 

Therefore, the given program is incorrect as it does not perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the elements in the list 'a'.

Correctness: **False**
