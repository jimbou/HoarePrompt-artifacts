This function, `recursive_maximize_sum`, takes a list of non-negative integers `a` and two indices `l` and `r` as input, where `0 <= l <= r < len(a)`. It modifies the list `a` by either setting all elements from index `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` if the sum of these elements is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, or recursively maximizing the sum of the elements in the sublists `a[l:pos]` and `a[pos+1:r+1]` if the sum is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, where `pos` is the index of the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r+1]`. The function also keeps track of the operations performed by appending the tuple `(l, r)` to the list `ops` when setting all elements to `r - l + 1`. The function returns no value, but modifies the input list `a` and the list `ops` in place.
