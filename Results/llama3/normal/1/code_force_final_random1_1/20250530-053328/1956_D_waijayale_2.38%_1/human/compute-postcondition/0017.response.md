Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive), `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist of `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive), and the current value of `pos` is the index of `mx` in the entire list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, a recursive call to `recursive_maximize_sum` with arguments `pos + 1` and `r` has been made, and the value returned by this recursive call has been returned. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further recursive calls are made.***
