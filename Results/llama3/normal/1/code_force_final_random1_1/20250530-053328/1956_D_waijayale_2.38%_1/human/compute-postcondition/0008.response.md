Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is a list of pairs of integers that must have at least 2 pairs, `l` is the first element of the second pair in `ops`, `r` is the second element of the second pair in `ops`, stdin is empty, and the sum of the elements in `a` which is `s` and the maximum element in `a` which is `m` are being printed, and this is printed: `l + 1` and `r + 1`**
