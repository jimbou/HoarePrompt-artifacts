Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`, computing `x` as the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set `{a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}`, and simultaneously setting `a_l := x, a_{l+1} := x, ..., a_r := x`.

The program consists of four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `recursive_maximize_sum`, and `func_3`.

`func_1` is a recursive function that takes an array `a`, two indices `l` and `r`, and a list of operations `ops` as input. It checks if `l` is equal to `r`, and if so, it checks if the element at index `l` is not equal to 0. If it is not equal to 0, it appends the operation `(l, l)` to `ops` and sets the element at index `l` to 0. Then, it calls itself with `l + 1` and `r` as the new indices. If `l` is not equal to `r`, it calls itself with `l + 1` and `r` as the new indices, and then checks if the element at index `l` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If it is not equal, it appends the operation `(l, r)` to `ops`, sets all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1`, and calls itself with `l + 1` and `r` as the new indices.

`func_2` takes an array `a` as input and returns a tuple containing the maximum sum of elements, the number of operations, and the list of operations. It initializes an empty list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with 0 and `n - 1` as the initial indices.

`recursive_maximize_sum` is a recursive function that takes two indices `l` and `r` as input. It calculates the sum of elements in the range `[l, r]` and checks if it is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If it is, it calls `func_1` with `a`, `l`, `r`, and `ops` as input, appends the operation `(l, r)` to `ops`, and sets all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1`. If the sum is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it finds the maximum element in the range `[l, r]` and its position `pos`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, it calls itself with `l` and `pos - 1` as the new indices. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, it calls itself with `pos + 1` and `r` as the new indices.

`func_3` reads the input, calls `func_2` with the input array, and prints the maximum sum and the list of operations.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the operation and the recursive approach to maximize the sum of elements in the array. The use of recursion allows the program to explore all possible ranges and find the maximum sum. The program also correctly handles the case where the sum of elements in a range is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` by finding the maximum element and its position, and recursively calling itself with the updated indices.

Correctness: **True**
