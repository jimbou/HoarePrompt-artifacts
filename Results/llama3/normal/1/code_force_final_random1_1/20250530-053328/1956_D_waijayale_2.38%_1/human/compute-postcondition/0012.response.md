Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers, s is the sum of the elements in a, m is the maximum element in a, ops is a list of pairs of integers, stdin is empty, the sum of the elements in a which is s and the maximum element in a which is m are being printed, and all pairs of integers in ops have been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variables `n`, `a`, `s`, `m`, and `stdin` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The variable `ops` is now empty, as all pairs of integers have been processed and printed. The sum of the elements in `a` and the maximum element in `a` are still being printed, as they were before the loop started. The loop has printed all pairs of integers in `ops`, with each pair being printed as `l + 1` and `r + 1`, where `l` and `r` are the elements of the pair.
