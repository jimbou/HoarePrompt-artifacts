Output State: **`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive), `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist of `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive), and the current value of `pos` is the index of `mx` in the entire list `a`. A recursive call to `recursive_maximize_sum` with arguments `pos + 1` and `r` has been made, and the value returned by this recursive call has been returned.**

In natural language, the output state is: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called recursively with the arguments `pos + 1` and `r`, and the returned value from this recursive call has been returned. The values of `l`, `r`, `a`, `s`, and `mx` remain unchanged. The current value of `pos` is still the index of `mx` in the entire list `a`.
