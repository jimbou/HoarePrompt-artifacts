You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), and a is a list of non-negative integers.
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)) :
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
            
        #State: `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `i` is `r`, `a` is a list of non-negative integers where all elements from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) are `r - l + 1`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) plus `r - l + 1 - a[l]`, and `ops` is a list of tuples where the last tuple is (`l`, `r`).
    else :
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if (pos != l) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        #State: *`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive), `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist of `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive), and the current value of `pos` is the index of `mx` in the entire list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, a recursive call to `recursive_maximize_sum` with arguments `l` and `pos - 1` has been made, and the value returned by this recursive call has been returned.
        if (pos != r) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
        #State: *`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive), `s` is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist of `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive), and the current value of `pos` is the index of `mx` in the entire list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, a recursive call to `recursive_maximize_sum` with arguments `pos + 1` and `r` has been made, and the value returned by this recursive call has been returned. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further recursive calls are made.
    #State: *`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `a` is a list of non-negative integers. If the sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) is less than or equal to (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), then all elements from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) are set to `r - l + 1`, `s` is updated to the sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) plus `r - l + 1 - a[l]`, and `ops` is updated with the tuple (`l`, `r`). Otherwise, if the sum of the elements in `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive) is greater than (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1), then `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist of `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive), and the current value of `pos` is the index of `mx` in the entire list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, a recursive call to `recursive_maximize_sum` with arguments `pos + 1` and `r` has been made, and the value returned by this recursive call has been returned. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further recursive calls are made.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
