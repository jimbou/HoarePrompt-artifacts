Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the second element of `s`**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 0. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
