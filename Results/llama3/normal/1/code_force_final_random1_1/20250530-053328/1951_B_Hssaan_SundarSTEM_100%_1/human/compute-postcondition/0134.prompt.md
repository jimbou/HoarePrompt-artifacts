Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and k are integers, s is a list of integers with the first element and the kth element swapped, ans is 0, h is the new first element of s, j is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, i is the last element in s that is less than or equal to h, p is 0, ans1 is the number of elements in s that are equal to h (excluding the first element), and z is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first element and the kth element swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` (excluding the first element), and `z` is 1. If `h` is less than `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first element and the kth element swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the next element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` (excluding the first element), and `z` is 1. If `h` is less than `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first element and the kth element swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the next element in `s`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` (excluding the first element), and `z` is 1. If `h` is less than `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is updated.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
