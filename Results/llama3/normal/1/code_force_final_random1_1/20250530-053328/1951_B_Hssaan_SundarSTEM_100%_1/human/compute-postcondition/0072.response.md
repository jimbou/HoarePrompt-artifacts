Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements and the first element and the kth element swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1 or 2, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the fourth element in `s`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are equal to `h`, `z` is 1**

The code increments the value of `j` by 1, so `j` is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
