Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is 0, the current value of `h` is the kth element of the original list `s` and is less than the current value of `i` which is the second element of `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `i`, `j`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.
