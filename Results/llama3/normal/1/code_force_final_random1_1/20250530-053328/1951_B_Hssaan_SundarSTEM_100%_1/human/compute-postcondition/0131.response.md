Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first element and the kth element swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the next element in `s`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` (excluding the first element), and `z` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.
