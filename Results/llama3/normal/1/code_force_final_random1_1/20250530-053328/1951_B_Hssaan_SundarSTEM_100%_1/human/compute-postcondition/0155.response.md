Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty with the first element and the kth element swapped back to their original positions, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` (excluding the first element), `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the second element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 0 or 1, and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` > `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` <= `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of the variables remain the same, but the program execution will exit the current loop or if statement.
