The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a list of integers with the first element and the kth element swapped back to their original positions, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is not empty and `i` is the first element in `s`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty with the first element and the kth element swapped back to their original positions, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` (excluding the first element), `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the first element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1, `ans1` is 0, and `z` is 0**
