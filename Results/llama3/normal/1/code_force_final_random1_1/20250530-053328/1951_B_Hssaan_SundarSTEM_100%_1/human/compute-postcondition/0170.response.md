The code prints the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1`. 

`ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` (excluding the first element), where `h` is the new first element of `s`. 

`ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` (excluding the first element).

Since `ans` counts elements less than or equal to `h` and `ans1` counts elements equal to `h`, `ans` will always be greater than or equal to `ans1`. 

Therefore, the `max(ans, ans1)` will always return `ans`.

Output: **ans (which is the number of elements in s that are less than or equal to h, excluding the first element)**
