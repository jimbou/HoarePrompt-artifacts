Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty with the first element and the kth element swapped back to their original positions, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` (excluding the first element), `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the first element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1, `ans1` is 0, and `z` is 0. The first element `i` of `s` is not equal to `h` and the current value of `i` is greater than `h`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their previous values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next line outside the loop or if statement.
