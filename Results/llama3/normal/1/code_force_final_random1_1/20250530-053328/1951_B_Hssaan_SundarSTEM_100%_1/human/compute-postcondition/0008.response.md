Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the second element of `s`. If `h` is less than `i`, then `ans` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `h` is greater than or equal to `i`.***
