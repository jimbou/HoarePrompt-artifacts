Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty with the first element and the kth element swapped back to their original positions, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` (excluding the first element), `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the first element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1, `ans1` is 1, and `z` is 1. The first element `i` of `s` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is less than or equal to `h`.**

The code increments the value of `ans1` by 1. The initial value of `ans1` was 0, so after the increment, `ans1` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
