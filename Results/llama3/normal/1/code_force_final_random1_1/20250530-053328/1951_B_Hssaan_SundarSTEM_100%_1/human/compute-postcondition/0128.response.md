Postcondition: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first element and the kth element swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the next element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` (excluding the first element), and `z` is 1. If `h` is less than `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.**
