The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` can be 0, 1, or 2, so the new value of `ans` can be 1, 2, or 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements and the first element and the kth element swapped, `ans` is either 1, 2 or 3, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the fourth element in `s`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are equal to `h`, `z` is 1**
