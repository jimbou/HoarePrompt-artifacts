Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the maximum number of wins can be achieved by swapping the cow with a cow that is not in the position immediately after the current position of the cow. 

For example, consider the input:

5 3
10 8 12 11 9

In this case, the maximum number of wins can be achieved by swapping the cow with the cow in position 5, not in position 4. However, the program only considers swapping the cow with the cow in position 4, and therefore it does not find the optimal solution.

The program only checks two possibilities: not swapping the cow at all, and swapping the cow with the cow in the position immediately after the current position of the cow. However, there are other possibilities that the program does not consider, and therefore it is not correct.
