Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least four elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is either 1, 2 or 3, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the fourth element of `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1, 2, or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
