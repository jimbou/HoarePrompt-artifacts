Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with the first element and the kth element swapped back to their original positions, ans is the number of elements in s that are less than or equal to h (excluding the first element), h is the new first element of s, j is the index of the last element in s that is less than or equal to h, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, i is the last element in s that is less than or equal to h, p is j + 1, ans1 is 0, and z is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty with the first element and the kth element swapped back to their original positions, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` (excluding the first element), `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the first element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 0 or 1, and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` > `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` <= `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty with the first element and the kth element swapped back to their original positions, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` (excluding the first element), `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the second element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` > `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` <= `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty with the first element and the kth element swapped back to their original positions, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` (excluding the first element), `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the third element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` > `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` <= `h`, then `ans1` is 2 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1 or 0. If `s[0]` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0 or 1. `z` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
