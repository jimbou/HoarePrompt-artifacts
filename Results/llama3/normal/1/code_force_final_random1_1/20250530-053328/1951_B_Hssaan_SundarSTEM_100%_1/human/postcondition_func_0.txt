This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers representing the number of cows and the index of a specific cow, and the second line contains a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function then swaps the first cow with the cow at the specified index, finds the number of cows with ratings less than or equal to the new first cow's rating, and finds the number of cows with ratings equal to the new first cow's rating. Finally, it prints the maximum of these two counts for each test case.
