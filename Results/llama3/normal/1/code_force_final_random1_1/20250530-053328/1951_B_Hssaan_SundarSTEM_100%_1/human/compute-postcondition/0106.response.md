Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with the first element and the kth element swapped twice and must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the third element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `p` is `j` + 1, `z` is 1, `ans1` is either 2 or 3.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to 1, and the possible values of `ans1` have been updated to either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
