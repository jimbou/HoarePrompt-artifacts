The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is in `s[1:]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third element of `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `i` is the fourth element of `s`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least four elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1 or 2, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the fourth element of `s`.**
