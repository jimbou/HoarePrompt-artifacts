Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is an integer, s is the original list of integers, ans is the number of elements in s (excluding the first element) that are less than or equal to h, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is the index of the last element in s that is less than or equal to h, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, i is the last element in s that is less than or equal to h, p is j + 1, ans1 is 0, z is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the first element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1, `ans1` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is equal to `h` or not, and `z` is 1 if `i` is equal to `h` or the loop breaks if `i` is greater than `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the second element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `z` is 1 and `ans1` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, otherwise it is 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is equal to `h` or not. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the loop breaks and `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 2 if `i` is equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is equal to `h` or not, and `z` is 1 if `i` is equal to `h` or the loop breaks if `i` is greater than `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that has at least 3 elements, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first two elements) that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the third element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `z` is 1 and `ans1` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the first element of `s` is equal to `h` or not. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the loop breaks and `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` is equal to `h` or not, and `z` is 1 if `i` is equal to `h` or the loop breaks if `i` is greater than `h`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
