Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least three elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the third element of `s`. If `h` is less than `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `h` is greater than or equal to `i` and `ans` is 1 or 2.**
