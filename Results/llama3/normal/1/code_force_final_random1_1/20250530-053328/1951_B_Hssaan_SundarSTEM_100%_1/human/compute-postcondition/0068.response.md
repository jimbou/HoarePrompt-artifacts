Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first element and the kth element swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the third element in `s`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are equal to `h`, `z` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
