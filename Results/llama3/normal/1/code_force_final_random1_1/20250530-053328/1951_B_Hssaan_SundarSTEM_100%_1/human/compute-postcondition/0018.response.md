Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least four elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the fourth element of `s`. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1, 2 or 3.***
