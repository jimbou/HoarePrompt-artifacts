Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with the first element and the kth element swapped twice and must have at least 1 element, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `p` is `j` + 1, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 0. The current value of `i` is not equal to `h`.**

The code increments the value of `ans1` by 1. The initial value of `ans1` was 0, so after the increment, `ans1` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
