Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty with the first element and the kth element swapped back to their original positions, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` (excluding the first element), `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains no test cases, `i` is the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `p` is `j` + 1, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` (excluding the first element), `z` is 1, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` (excluding the first element) and the number of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` (excluding the first element) is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the list `s` has been processed for all test cases. The first element and the kth element of `s` have been swapped back to their original positions. The variables `ans` and `ans1` hold the maximum number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and equal to `h`, respectively, excluding the first element. The variable `j` holds the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, and `p` is `j` + 1. The variable `z` is 1, indicating that the loop has executed at least once. The maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` has been printed for all test cases.
