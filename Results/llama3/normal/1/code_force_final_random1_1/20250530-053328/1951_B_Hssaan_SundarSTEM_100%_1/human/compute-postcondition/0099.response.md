Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with the first element and the kth element swapped twice and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the second element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `p` is `j` + 1, `ans1` is either 1 or 2, and `z` is either 0 or 1.**

The value of `ans1` is incremented by 1. Since `ans1` was either 0 or 1, it is now either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.
