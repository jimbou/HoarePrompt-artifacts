Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty with the first element and the kth element swapped back to their original positions, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` (excluding the first element), `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the third element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 2 or 1 or 0. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` > `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` <= `h`, then `ans1` is 2 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1 or 0. If `s[0]` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0 or 1. `z` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `z` is now 1. This means that if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 2 or 1 or 0. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` > `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` <= `h`, then `ans1` is 2. If `s[0]` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1.
