Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty with the first element and the kth element swapped back to their original positions, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` (excluding the first element), `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the second element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1, `z` is 1, `ans1` is 1 if `i` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to 1, and the value of `ans1` has been updated based on the value of `i` and `h`. The other variables remain unchanged.
