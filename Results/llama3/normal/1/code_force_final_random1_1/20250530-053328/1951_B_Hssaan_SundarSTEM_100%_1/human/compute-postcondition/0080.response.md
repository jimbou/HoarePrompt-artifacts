Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with the first element and the kth element swapped twice and must have at least 1 element, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `p` is `j` + 1, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0. The current value of `i` is equal to `h`.**
