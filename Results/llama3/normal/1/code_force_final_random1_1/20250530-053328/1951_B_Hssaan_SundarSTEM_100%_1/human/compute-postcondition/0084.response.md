Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with the first element and the kth element swapped twice and must have at least 1 element, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `p` is `j` + 1, `ans1` is 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 0, `z` is 1. The current value of `i` is equal to `h` if the first element of `s` is equal to `h`, otherwise the current value of `i` is not equal to `h`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `z` has been updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
