Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least four elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1 or 2, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the fourth element of `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The break statement does not change the values of any variables, it only affects the control flow of the program.
