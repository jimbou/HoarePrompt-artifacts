Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first element and the kth element swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the next element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` (excluding the first element), and `z` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `s` still has at least two elements with the first and kth elements swapped, and `h` is still the new first element of `s`. The value of `i` is still the next element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, and `p` and `ans1` remain 0. The value of `z` is still 1, and `ans` is still either 0 or 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.
