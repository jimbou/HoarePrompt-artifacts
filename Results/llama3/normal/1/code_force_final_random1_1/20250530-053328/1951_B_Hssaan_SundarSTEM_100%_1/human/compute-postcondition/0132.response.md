The value of `ans` is increased by 1. The previous value of `ans` can be 0, 1, or 2, so the new value of `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first element and the kth element swapped, `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the next element in `s`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` (excluding the first element), and `z` is 1.**
