Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first element and the kth element swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the second element in `s`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are equal to `h`, `z` is 1. The current value of `h` is less than the current value of `i`***
