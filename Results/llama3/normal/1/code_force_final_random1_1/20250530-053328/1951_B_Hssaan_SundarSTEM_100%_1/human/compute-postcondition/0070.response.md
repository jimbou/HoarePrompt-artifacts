Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first element and the kth element swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1 or 2, `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the third element in `s`, `p` is 0, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are equal to `h`, `z` is 1. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.***
