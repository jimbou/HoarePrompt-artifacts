Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that has at least 3 elements, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first two elements) that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the third element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 2 if `i` is equal to `h`, otherwise 1 if `i` is not equal to `h` and `i` is not greater than `h`, otherwise the loop breaks and `z` is 1 if `i` is greater than `h` or `i` is equal to `h`. If `s[0]` is equal to `h`, then the value of `ans1` and `z` is determined by the previous conditions.**
