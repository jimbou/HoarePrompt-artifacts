Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty with the first element and the kth element swapped back to their original positions, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` (excluding the first element), `h` is the new first element of `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the first element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1, `ans1` is 0 or 1, and `z` is 1. The current value of `i` is equal to the current value of `h` or the current value of `i` is not equal to the current value of `h`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `z` has been updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
