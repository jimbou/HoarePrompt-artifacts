Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least three elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the third element of `s`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition `if h is less than i, then ans is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, ans is 1 and h is greater than or equal to i` is still valid, but we are now outside the loop or if statement.
