Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is the index of the last element in `s` that is less than or equal to `h`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the second element in `s`, `p` is `j` + 1, and `z` is 1 if `i` is equal to `h` or the loop breaks if `i` is greater than `h`. If the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1. Otherwise, `ans1` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is equal to `h` or not.***
