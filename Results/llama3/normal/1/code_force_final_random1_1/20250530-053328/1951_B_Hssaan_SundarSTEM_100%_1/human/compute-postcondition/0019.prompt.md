Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with the first and kth elements swapped, ans is 0, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is -1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the second element of `s`. If `h` is less than `i`, then `ans` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `h` is greater than or equal to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least three elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the third element of `s`. If `h` is less than `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `h` is greater than or equal to `i` and `ans` is 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least four elements and the first and kth elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two inputs, `i` is the fourth element of `s`. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1, 2 or 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
