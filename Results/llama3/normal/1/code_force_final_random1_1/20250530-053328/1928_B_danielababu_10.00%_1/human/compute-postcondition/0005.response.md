To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from the second last index of `arr` down to the first index (0) in reverse order.


At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order.


The state of `arr` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified in the loop head.


The state of `ans` and `tem` does not need to be adjusted, as they are not used in the loop head.


Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:


State: **arr is a list of non-zero integers that must have at least 2 elements, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, and the product of the second last element of arr and the last element of arr, tem is the product of the second last element of arr and the last element of arr, i is len(arr) - 3**
