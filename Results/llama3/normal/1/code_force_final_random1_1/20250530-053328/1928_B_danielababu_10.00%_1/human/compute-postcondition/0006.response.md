Output State: **arr is a list of non-zero integers that must have at least 2 elements, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, the product of the second last element of arr and the last element of arr, and the product of the second last element of arr, the last element of arr, and the element at index i of arr, tem is the product of the second last element of arr, the last element of arr, and the element at index i of arr, i is len(arr) - 3**

The code multiplies the current value of `tem` by the element at index `i` of `arr` and assigns the result back to `tem`. Then, it appends the new value of `tem` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` remains unchanged. The list `arr` is not modified. The initial values of `ans` are preserved, and a new element is added to the end of the list. The final state includes the updated values of `tem` and `ans`, while `arr` and `i` remain unchanged.
