Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding some permutation to the array. However, the provided program does not implement any logic to solve this problem. It only contains some general-purpose functions for input and sorting, but it does not use these functions to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To solve this problem, the program should sort the array and then find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation. This can be done by iterating over the sorted array and finding the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be made equal. The program should also consider the case where the array is already sorted, in which case the maximum number of elements that can be made equal is the length of the array.
