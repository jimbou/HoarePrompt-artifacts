#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a non-negative integer.
    return int(input())
    #The program returns a non-negative integer that was provided as input.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a non-negative integer from standard input and returns it as an integer value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, where each integer is a number from the space-separated list of integers in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input, converts each integer to an integer type, and returns a map object containing the sequence of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were provided as input in the stdin, separated by spaces.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns them as a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers that were provided as a space-separated list in the standard input.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from the standard input, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of strings.
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a space-separated list of strings from stdin, where each string is converted to a string type.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a space-separated list of strings from standard input and returns a map object containing the strings, with each string explicitly converted to a string type.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters in the string from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string from standard input and returns it as a list of characters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a line of space-separated strings
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a list of strings sorted in ascending order, where each string is a word from the input line of space-separated strings.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of space-separated strings from standard input, splits it into individual words, and returns them as a sorted list of strings in ascending order.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: arr is a list of non-negative integers, ans is a list containing len(arr) non-negative integers, tem is the product of all elements in arr, i is len(arr)-1
    return ans
    #The program returns a list 'ans' containing len(arr) non-negative integers

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns a new list containing the cumulative product of the input list elements. The returned list has the same length as the input list, where each element at index i is the product of all elements in the input list up to index i.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-zero integers.
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: arr is a list of non-zero integers, ans is a list containing the product of all elements of arr, tem is the product of all elements of arr, i is -1
    return ans
    #The program returns a list containing the product of all non-zero integers in the list 'arr'.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-zero integers as input and returns a new list containing the cumulative product of all elements in the input list, in reverse order. The input list remains unchanged.
