The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `len(arr) - 2`. Since `i` is decreasing by 1 in each iteration, we can conclude that `len(arr)` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-zero integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list containing the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, `tem` is the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 2**
