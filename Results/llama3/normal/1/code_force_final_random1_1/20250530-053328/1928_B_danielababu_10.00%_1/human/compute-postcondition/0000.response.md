Output State: **arr is a list of non-zero integers, ans is an empty list, tem is 1**

The code initializes two new variables, `ans` and `tem`, without modifying the existing variable `arr`. The first line creates an empty list and assigns it to `ans`. The second line assigns the value 1 to `tem`. Since `arr` is not affected by the code, it remains a list of non-zero integers.
