Output State: **arr is a list of non-zero integers that must have at least 2 elements, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, and the product of the second last element of arr and the last element of arr, tem is the product of the second last element of arr and the last element of arr, i is len(arr) - 2**

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged, still containing at least 2 non-zero integers. The variable `ans` now contains two elements: the original product of the last element of `arr` and 1, and the new product of the second last element of `arr` and the last element of `arr`. The variable `tem` has been updated to hold the product of the second last element of `arr` and the last element of `arr`. The variable `i` remains unchanged, still holding the value of `len(arr) - 2`.
