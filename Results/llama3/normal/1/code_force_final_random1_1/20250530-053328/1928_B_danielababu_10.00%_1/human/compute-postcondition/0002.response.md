Output State: **arr is a list of non-zero integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, tem is the product of the last element of arr and 1, i is len(arr) - 1**

In this output state, the value of `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `ans` is updated to contain the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, which is the result of the expression `tem *= arr[i]`. The value of `tem` is also updated to be the product of the last element of `arr` and 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
