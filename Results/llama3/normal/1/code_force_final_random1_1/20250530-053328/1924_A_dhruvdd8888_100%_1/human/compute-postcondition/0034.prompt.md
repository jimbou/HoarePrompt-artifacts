Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear after every k-1 characters in the string s, ps is the number of times the length of win is equal to k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and i is the last character in the string s. ps is less than n, and 'NO' is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is an empty string, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 element, `win` is a set, `ans` is a list containing all the characters in the string `s` that are in the set `us` and appear after every `k-1` characters in the string `s`, `ps` is the number of times the length of `win` is equal to `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the first element in the set `us`, 'NO' is printed, and `i` is in `win`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The program returns a string that starts with the characters in the list `ans` (which contains all the characters in the string `s` that are in the set `us` and appear after every `k-1` characters in the string `s`), followed by the character `i` (which is the second element in the set `us`), and then padded with `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters to make the total length of the string equal to `n`, if `i` is not in the set `win`. Otherwise, no string is returned.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The program returns a string that starts with the characters in the list `ans` (which contains all the characters in the string `s` that are in the set `us` and appear after every `k-1` characters in the string `s`), followed by the character `i` (which is the third element in the set `us`), and then padded with `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters to make the total length of the string equal to `n`, if `i` is not in the set `win`. Otherwise, no string is returned.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
