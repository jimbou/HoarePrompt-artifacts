Postcondition: ***The program returns a string that starts with the characters in the list `ans` (which contains all the characters in the string `s` that are in the set `us` and appear after every `k-1` characters in the string `s`), followed by the character `i` (which is the third element in the set `us`), and then padded with `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters to make the total length of the string equal to `n`, if `i` is not in the set `win`. Otherwise, no string is returned.***
