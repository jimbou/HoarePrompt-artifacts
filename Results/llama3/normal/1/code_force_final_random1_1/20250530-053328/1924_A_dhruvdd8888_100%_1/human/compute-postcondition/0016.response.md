Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `m` are non-negative integers between 1 and 26, 1 and 26, 1 and 1000 respectively. `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and has at least two characters. `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If the length of `win` is equal to `k`, then `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the third character in the string `s`, `ps` is 1, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
