To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the set `us`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set `us`. If `us` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, we can adjust its state to ensure it has at least one element. Additionally, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be the first element in `us`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is an empty string, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that must have at least 1 element, `win` is a set, `ans` is a list containing all the characters in the string `s` that are in the set `us` and appear after every `k-1` characters in the string `s`, `ps` is the number of times the length of `win` is equal to `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the first element in the set `us`, and 'NO' is printed**
