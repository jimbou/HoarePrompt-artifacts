Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `k` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, `m` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a string of length `m-1` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and has at least one character, `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set containing the second character in the string `s`, `ans` is a list, `ps` is 0 or 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and `i` is the second character in the string `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `ans`, `ps`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the set `win` now contains the second character in the string `s`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
