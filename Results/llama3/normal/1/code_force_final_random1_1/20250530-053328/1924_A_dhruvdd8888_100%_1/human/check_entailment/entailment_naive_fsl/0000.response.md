Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the string `s` contains characters that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. In this case, the program will incorrectly count these characters as part of the subsequences, leading to incorrect results.

For example, if `n = 2`, `k = 2`, and `s = "abbaa"`, the program will incorrectly count the extra "a" at the end of the string as part of the subsequences, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this issue, the program should ignore characters in `s` that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
