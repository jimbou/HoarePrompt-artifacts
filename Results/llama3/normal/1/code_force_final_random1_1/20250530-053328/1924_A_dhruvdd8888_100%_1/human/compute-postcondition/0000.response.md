Output State: **n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is an empty list, ps is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code reads the first line of a test case from stdin, assigning the values of n, k, and m. It then reads the second line of the test case, assigning the string s. The set us is created containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. The set win and list ans are initialized as empty, and the variable ps is set to 0. Stdin now contains one less test case.
