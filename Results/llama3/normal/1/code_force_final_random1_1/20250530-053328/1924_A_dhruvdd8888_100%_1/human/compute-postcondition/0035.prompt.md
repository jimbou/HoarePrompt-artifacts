You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and m. The second line contains a string s. n, k, and m are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000. s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear after every k-1 characters in the string s, ps is the number of times the length of win is equal to k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and i is the last character in the string s.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State: *n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear after every k-1 characters in the string s, ps is the number of times the length of win is equal to k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and i is the last character in the string s. ps is less than n
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: The program returns a string that starts with the characters in the list `ans` (which contains all the characters in the string `s` that are in the set `us` and appear after every `k-1` characters in the string `s`), followed by the character `i` (which is the last element in the set `us`), and then padded with `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters to make the total length of the string equal to `n`, if `i` is not in the set `win`. Otherwise, no string is returned.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES'

Case_2: The program returns a string that starts with the characters in the list `ans` (which contains all the characters in the string `s` that are in the set `us` and appear after every `k-1` characters in the string `s`), followed by the character `i` (which is the last element in the set `us`), and then padded with `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters to make the total length of the string equal to `n`, if `i` is not in the set `win`. Otherwise, no string is returned.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
