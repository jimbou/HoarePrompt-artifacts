Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and returns either 'YES' or a constructed string. It takes no parameters and returns a value based on the input. The function's purpose is to determine if a certain condition is met in the input string and return 'YES' if it is, or construct a string based on the input and return it if the condition is not met. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it has processed one test case from stdin and returned either 'YES' or a constructed string.**
