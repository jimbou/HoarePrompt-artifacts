Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and m. The second line contains a string s. n, k, and m are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000. s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear after every k-1 characters in the string s, ps is the number of times the length of win is equal to k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and i is the last character in the string s.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State: *n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear after every k-1 characters in the string s, ps is the number of times the length of win is equal to k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and i is the last character in the string s. ps is less than n
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: The program returns a string that starts with the characters in the list `ans` (which contains all the characters in the string `s` that are in the set `us` and appear after every `k-1` characters in the string `s`), followed by the character `i` (which is the last element in the set `us`), and then padded with `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters to make the total length of the string equal to `n`, if `i` is not in the set `win`. Otherwise, no string is returned.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and returns either 'YES' or a constructed string. It takes no parameters and returns a value based on the input. The function's purpose is to determine if a certain condition is met in the input string and return 'YES' if it is, or construct a string based on the input and return it if the condition is not met. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it has processed one test case from stdin and returned either 'YES' or a constructed string.
