Output State: **n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty string, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is a set, ans is a list containing all the characters in the string s that are in the set us and appear after every k-1 characters in the string s, ps is the number of times the length of win is equal to k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and i is the last character in the string s.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string s is empty, and the list ans contains all the characters in the original string s that are in the set us and appear after every k-1 characters in the string s. The variable ps is the number of times the length of win is equal to k, which means the number of times a character in the string s is added to the list ans. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
