Output State: **n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, k is a non-negative integer between 1 and 26, m is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, s is a string of length m-1 consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets and has at least one character, us is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, win is an empty set, ans is a list containing the second character in the string s, ps is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and i is the second character in the string s.**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line appends the value of `i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is the second character in the string `s`, `ans` now contains this character. The second line increments the value of `ps` by 1, making it 1. The third line clears the set `win`, making it an empty set. No other variables are affected by the code block.
