Output State: **`p` is a list of four even integers between 0 and 200, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200), `int(input())` is greater than 0, and `_` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to a new list of four even integers between 0 and 200, which are obtained by taking the input from `stdin` and applying the lambda function to each integer. The lambda function subtracts the remainder of the integer divided by 2 from the integer itself, effectively rounding down to the nearest even number. The other variables, `_` and `int(input())`, remain unchanged. The `stdin` now contains `t-1` lines, each with four integers `p_i` between 0 and 200.
