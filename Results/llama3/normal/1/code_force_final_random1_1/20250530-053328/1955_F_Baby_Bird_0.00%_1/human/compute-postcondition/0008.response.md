To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The objects in the loop head are `_` and `int(input())`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `int(input())` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

State: **`p` is a list of four even integers between 0 and 200, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200), `int(input())` is greater than 1, and `_` is 2, and this is printed: 0 + sum of the list p divided by 2**
