Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
    print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p` is a list of four even integers between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `int(input())` is greater than 0, and `_` is 0, and this is printed: (sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2 which is equal to 0 + sum(p) // 2 because the first three elements of p are even integers, so x % 2 > 0 is always False for the first three elements of p, and sum(p) // 2 is the sum of the four even integers in p divided by 2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p` is a list of four even integers between 0 and 200, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200), `int(input())` is greater than 0, and `_` is 1, and this is printed: 0 + sum of the list p divided by 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p` is a list of four even integers between 0 and 200, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200), `int(input())` is greater than 1, and `_` is 2, and this is printed: 0 + sum of the list p divided by 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
