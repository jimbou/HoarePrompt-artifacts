Output State: **`p` is a list of four even integers between 0 and 200, `stdin` is empty, `int(input())` is 0, and `_` is equal to the initial value of `t`, and this is printed: 0 + sum of the list p divided by 2**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input `stdin` is empty because all lines have been read, the value of `_` is equal to the initial value of `t` because the loop has executed `t` times, and the printed output is the sum of the four even integers in `p` divided by 2, because the first three elements of `p` are even integers, so `x % 2 > 0` is always False for the first three elements of `p`.
