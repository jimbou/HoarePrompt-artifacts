Output State: **`p` is a list of four even integers between 0 and 200, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200), `int(input())` is greater than 1, and `_` is 2, and this is printed: 0 + sum of the list p divided by 2**

In this output state, the list `p` has been updated to a new list of four even integers between 0 and 200, which are obtained by taking the input from `stdin`, splitting it into four integers, and then subtracting the remainder of each integer divided by 2 (i.e., rounding down to the nearest even integer). The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
