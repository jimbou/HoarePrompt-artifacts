The code `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` takes an input from stdin, splits it into four integers, subtracts the remainder of each integer divided by 2 (which effectively rounds down to the nearest even number), and assigns the resulting list to `p`.

Given the initial state, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). The first line is read as input, and the four integers are processed as described above.

The value of `int(input())` is greater than 0, but this is not directly related to the code snippet, so it remains unchanged.

The variable `_` is 0, but it is not affected by the code snippet, so it remains 0.

The output state is: `p` is a list of four even integers between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `int(input())` is greater than 0, and `_` is 0.

Output State: **`p` is a list of four even integers between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `int(input())` is greater than 0, and `_` is 0.**
