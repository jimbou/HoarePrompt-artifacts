Output: **`p` is a list of four even integers between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `int(input())` is greater than 0, and `_` is 0, and this is printed: (sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2 which is equal to 0 + sum(p) // 2 because the first three elements of p are even integers, so x % 2 > 0 is always False for the first three elements of p, and sum(p) // 2 is the sum of the four even integers in p divided by 2**
