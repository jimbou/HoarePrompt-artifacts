To determine what will be printed when the given statement executes, let's break down the components of the print statement and analyze them based on the provided initial state.

1. `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3`:
   - `p[:3]` refers to the first three elements of the list `p`.
   - `map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])` applies a lambda function to each of these elements. The lambda function checks if a number is odd by verifying if the remainder of the division by 2 is greater than 0 (`x % 2 > 0`).
   - `list(...)` converts the map object into a list.
   - `sum(...)` sums up the boolean values in the list. In Python, `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0 when summed.
   - The condition `== 3` checks if the sum equals 3, which would mean all three elements are odd.

2. `sum(p) // 2`:
   - `sum(p)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `p`.
   - `// 2` performs integer division by 2, effectively dividing the sum by 2 and rounding down to the nearest whole number.

Given the initial state, `p` is a list of four even integers between 0 and 200. This means that for any element `x` in `p`, `x % 2` will always be 0 (since even numbers divided by 2 leave no remainder), and therefore `x % 2 > 0` will always be `False`.

So, breaking down the print statement:

- `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))` will always be 0 because all elements in `p` are even, making the condition `x % 2 > 0` always `False`.
- `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3` will always be `False` because the sum is 0, not 3. In a numeric context, `False` is treated as 0.
- `sum(p) // 2` will be the sum of the four even integers divided by 2. Since the exact values of `p` are not provided, we can't calculate the exact sum, but we know it will be an integer division of the total sum of `p` by 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output the result of adding 0 (from the `False` condition) to the integer division of the sum of `p` by 2.

Output: **0 + (sum of all elements in p divided by 2)**
