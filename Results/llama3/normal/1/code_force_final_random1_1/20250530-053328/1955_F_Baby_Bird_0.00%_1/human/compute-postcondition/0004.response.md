To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `p` is a list of four even integers between 0 and 200
* `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t-1` lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200)
* `int(input())` is greater than 0
* `_` is 0
* The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2` is equal to 0 + sum(p) // 2

For the loop to execute again, the loop counter `_` must be incremented, and the condition `int(input()) > 0` must still be true.

Since `_` is the loop counter, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, the new state of `_` is 1.

The state of `int(input())` is still greater than 0, as it is not affected by the loop iteration.

The state of `p`, `stdin`, and the expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`p` is a list of four even integers between 0 and 200, `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t-1` lines, each containing four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200), `int(input())` is greater than 0, and `_` is 1**
