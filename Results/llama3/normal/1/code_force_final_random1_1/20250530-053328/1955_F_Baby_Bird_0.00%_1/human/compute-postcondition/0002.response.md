To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break it down step by step:

1. `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))`: This part of the expression checks the first three elements of the list `p` to see if they are odd. Since `p` is a list of four even integers between 0 and 200, the first three elements will always be even. Therefore, `x % 2 > 0` will always be `False` for these elements, and the sum of these `False` values (which are treated as 0 in a numeric context) will be 0.

2. `== 3`: This comparison checks if the sum from step 1 is equal to 3. Since the sum is 0 (as determined in step 1), this comparison will always be `False`. In a numeric context, `False` is treated as 0.

3. `+ sum(p) // 2`: This part calculates the sum of all elements in the list `p` and then divides the sum by 2 using integer division (`//`). Since `p` is a list of four even integers, the sum of these integers will always be even. Dividing an even number by 2 will always result in an integer.

Given these steps, the expression simplifies to `0 + sum(p) // 2`. Since `sum(p)` is the sum of four even integers, `sum(p) // 2` will be an integer value representing half the sum of these four even integers.

Output: **half the sum of the four even integers in the list p**
