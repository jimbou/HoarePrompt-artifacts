Reasoning:

The given program is designed to decode a string that was previously encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves replacing each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

The decoding function `func_1` works by first creating a string `r` that consists of all distinct letters of the encoded string in alphabetical order. Then, it creates a mapping dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character (i.e., the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`).

Finally, the function uses this mapping dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding reversed mapping, effectively decoding the string.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of a dictionary to create the mapping between characters in `r` and their symmetric characters is efficient and effective.

Correctness: **True**
