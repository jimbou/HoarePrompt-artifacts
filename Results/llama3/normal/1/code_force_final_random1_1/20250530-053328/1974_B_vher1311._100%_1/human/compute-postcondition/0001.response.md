Output State: **The program returns a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, where each character in the string is the reversed mapping of the corresponding character in the encoded string, as defined in the mapping dictionary.**

In other words, the program returns a new string where each character in the original `encoded` string has been replaced by its corresponding reversed mapping, as specified in the `mapping` dictionary. The resulting string consists only of lowercase Latin letters, and its characters are in the same order as the original `encoded` string.
