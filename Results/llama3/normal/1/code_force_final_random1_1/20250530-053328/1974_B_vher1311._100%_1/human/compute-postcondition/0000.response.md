Output State: **encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, r is a string consisting of unique lowercase Latin letters in ascending order, mapping is a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of a lowercase Latin letter and its corresponding reversed mapping.**

The first line of code sorts the unique characters in the `encoded` string in ascending order and assigns the result to the variable `r`. This means that `r` will contain a string of unique lowercase Latin letters in alphabetical order.

The second line of code creates a dictionary `mapping` where each key-value pair consists of a character from `r` and its corresponding reversed mapping. The reversed mapping is obtained by taking the character at the index `- (i + 1)` in the string `r`, where `i` is the index of the character in the string. This means that the first character in `r` will be mapped to the last character in `r`, the second character will be mapped to the second last character, and so on.

For example, if `encoded` is the string "abcde", then `r` will be the string "abcde" and `mapping` will be the dictionary `{'a': 'e', 'b': 'd', 'c': 'c', 'd': 'b', 'e': 'a'}`.
