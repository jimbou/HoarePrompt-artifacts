Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The program first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string `b`. This is done correctly using the `sorted` function and `set` to remove duplicates.

2. Then, it creates a mapping between each character in `r` and its symmetric character. This is done correctly using a dictionary comprehension.

3. Finally, it decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its symmetric character using the mapping. This is done correctly using a generator expression.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the input string `b` contains duplicate characters, the program correctly ignores duplicates when constructing the auxiliary string `r`.
* When the input string `b` contains characters that are not present in the auxiliary string `r`, the program correctly raises a `KeyError` when trying to access the symmetric character in the mapping.
* When the input string `b` is empty, the program correctly returns an empty string.

Overall, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and handles all potential cases correctly.
