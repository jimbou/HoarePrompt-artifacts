Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of decoding a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves replacing each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input data, including the number of test cases `t`, the length of each string `n`, and the encoded string `b`.

2. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an encoded string `encoded` as input and returns the decoded string.

3. Inside `func_1`, the program creates a new string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string `encoded` in alphabetical order. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the string `r` should consist of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

4. The program then creates a mapping dictionary `mapping` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character. This is done by iterating over the indices `i` of `r` and mapping each character `r[i]` to the character at the corresponding symmetric index `-(i + 1)` from the end of `r`. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that each character in the original string should be replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r`.

5. Finally, the program uses the `mapping` dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string `encoded` with its corresponding decoded character, and returns the resulting decoded string. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the decoding process involves replacing each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character from the string `r`.

Based on this step-by-step analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
