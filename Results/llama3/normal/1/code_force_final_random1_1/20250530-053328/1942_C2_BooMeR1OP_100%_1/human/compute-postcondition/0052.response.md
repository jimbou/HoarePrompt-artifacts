Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `st` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n`, `gap` is an integer greater than 1 and is odd and is the next odd integer in the `odd` list, `odd` is a sorted list containing at least two more elements, `even` is a sorted list containing the current value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and is even, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times the original value of `y` plus `gap` if `y` is greater than or equal to `gap // 2`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times the original value of `y`, and `y` is 0.**
