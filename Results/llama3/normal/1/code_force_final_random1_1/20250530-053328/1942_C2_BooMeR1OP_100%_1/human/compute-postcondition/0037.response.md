Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 2, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is 2, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1, otherwise a[i + 1], and gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, and stdin contains t - 2 test cases. If gap is greater than 0 and is even, even contains the current value of gap. Otherwise, even is an empty list, and odd is an empty list.**
