To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `st` is a set of integers, `_` is 1, `i` is x - 1, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, `next_elem` is an integer equal to a[0] + n, `gap` is the last even integer in the list even, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t - 3 test cases, `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all even integers in the even list, and `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of half of all even integers in the even list, and `ans` is printed**
