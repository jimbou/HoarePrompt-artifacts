Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to the third input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 2, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[i + 1], gap is an integer greater than 0 and even, odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, otherwise ans remains unchanged.**
