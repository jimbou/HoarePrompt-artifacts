Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, x is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 2, i is 2 * x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is the last odd gap in the list, odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing all the even gaps in the list, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(2 * x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, otherwise y is 0 plus the sum of all odd gaps, and y is an integer equal to the original value of y minus the sum of half of all odd gaps.
Code of the loop:
for gap in even:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, x is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 2, i is 2 * x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is the first even gap in the list, odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing all the even gaps in the list that must have at least 1 element, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(2 * x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, otherwise y is 0 plus the sum of all odd gaps plus gap, and y is an integer equal to the original value of y minus the sum of half of all odd gaps minus gap // 2. If y < gap // 2, then y is 0. Otherwise, y remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, x is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 2, i is 2 * x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is the second even gap in the list, odd is a list containing the first odd gap in the list, even is a sorted list containing all the even gaps in the list that must have at least 2 elements, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(2 * x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, otherwise y is 0 plus the sum of all odd gaps plus gap plus gap, and y is an integer equal to the original value of y minus gap // 2 if y < gap // 2, otherwise y is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, x is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 2, i is 2 * x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is the third even gap in the list, odd is a list containing the first odd gap in the list, even is a sorted list containing all the even gaps in the list that must have at least 3 elements, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(2 * x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, otherwise y is 0 plus the sum of all odd gaps plus 2 times gap, and y is 0 if y is less than gap // 2, otherwise y is equal to the original value of y minus gap // 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
