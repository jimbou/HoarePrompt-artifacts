Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `x` is an integer greater than 3, `y` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, `st` is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in `a`, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[3] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[3] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all `i` in range(`x`) plus 2 times the original value of `y` if `y < gap // 2`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged plus 1 if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `gap` is the first odd gap in the list, `odd` is a sorted list containing all values of `gap` if `gap > 1` and `gap % 2 == 1`, `even` is an empty list.**
