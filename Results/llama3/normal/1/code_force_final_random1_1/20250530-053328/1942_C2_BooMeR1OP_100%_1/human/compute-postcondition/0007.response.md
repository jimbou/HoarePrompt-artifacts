Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, then ans is an integer equal to x - 1. Otherwise, ans remains an integer equal to x - 2, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is 0, t1 is an integer equal to (a[0] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[0] + 2) % n, stdin contains t - 2 test cases.***
