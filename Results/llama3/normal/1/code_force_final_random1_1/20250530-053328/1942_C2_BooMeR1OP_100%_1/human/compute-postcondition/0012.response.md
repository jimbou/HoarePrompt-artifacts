State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` if `t1` is in `st` or `t2` is not in `st`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 1`, `st` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[1] + 2) % n`, stdin contains `t - 2` test cases.**
