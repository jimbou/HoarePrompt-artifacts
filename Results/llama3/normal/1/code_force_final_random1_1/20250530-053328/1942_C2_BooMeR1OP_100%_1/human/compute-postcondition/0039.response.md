Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, and stdin contains t - 2 test cases. If gap is greater than 1 and is odd, odd contains the current value of gap. If gap is greater than 0 and is even, even contains the current value of gap. Otherwise, both odd and even are empty lists.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, except that the value of i is now x - 1, and the value of next_elem is now a[0] + n. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
