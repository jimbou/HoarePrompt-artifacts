Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the second input, x is an integer equal to the second input, y is an integer equal to the third input minus the sum of half of all even integers in the even list, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 1, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x), gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, odd is a sorted list containing the value of gap if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1, even is a sorted list of integers equal to the previous list of even integers plus the gap if gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the second input, x is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 1, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, otherwise ans remains unchanged, gap is the first odd gap in the list, odd is a sorted list containing the value of gap if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1, even is a sorted list of integers equal to the previous list of even integers plus the gap if gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0, and y is either 0 if y < gap // 2 or remains unchanged if y >= gap // 2, ans is increased by gap, y is decreased by gap // 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the second input, x is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 1, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, otherwise ans remains unchanged, gap is the second odd gap in the list, odd is a sorted list containing at least 2 values of gap if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1, even is a sorted list of integers equal to the previous list of even integers plus the gap if gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0, and y is either 0 if y < gap // 2 or remains unchanged if y >= gap // 2, ans is increased by gap, y is decreased by gap // 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the second input, x is an integer equal to the second input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 1, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, otherwise ans remains unchanged, gap is the third odd gap in the list, odd is a sorted list containing at least 3 values of gap if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1, even is a sorted list of integers equal to the previous list of even integers plus the gap if gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0, and y is either 0 if y < gap // 2 or remains unchanged if y >= gap // 2, ans is increased by gap, y is decreased by gap // 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
