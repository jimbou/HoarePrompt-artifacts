State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to the second input, `x` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, `st` is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in `a`, `_` is 2, `i` is x - 1, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, `next_elem` is an integer equal to a[0] + n, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, otherwise ans remains unchanged, `gap` is the first odd gap in the list, `odd` is a sorted list containing all values of gap if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1, `even` is an empty list, `y` is 0, and the value of ans is being printed**
