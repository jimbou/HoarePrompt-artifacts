Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, `st` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `odd` is a list containing the current value of `gap`, `even` is an empty list, stdin contains `t - 2` test cases, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1`, otherwise `a[i + 1]`, and the current value of `gap` is an integer greater than 1 and is odd.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `odd` now contains the current value of `gap`, which is an integer greater than 1 and is odd. All other variables remain unchanged.
