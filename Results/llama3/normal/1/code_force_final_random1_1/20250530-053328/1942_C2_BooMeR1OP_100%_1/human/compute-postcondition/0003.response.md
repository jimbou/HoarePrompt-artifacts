To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to be greater than 0 and set `i` to 0, which is the starting value for the range.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2`, `st` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t - 2` test cases**
