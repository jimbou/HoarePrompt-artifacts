Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is an integer greater than 1 and is odd and is the last odd integer in the odd list, odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing the current value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all odd integers in the odd list, and y is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of half of all odd integers in the odd list.
Code of the loop:
for gap in even:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is an integer greater than 0 and is even, odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing at least one element, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of gap, otherwise ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all odd integers in the odd list, and y is 0 if y is less than half of gap, otherwise y is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of half of all odd integers in the odd list, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus gap, and y is an integer equal to its original value minus half of gap.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is the next even integer in the list even, odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing at least two elements, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus gap, y is an integer equal to its original value minus half of gap.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is the next even integer in the list even which is greater than the current gap, odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing at least three elements, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus gap, and y is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the previous gap.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
