Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the second input, x is at least 3, y is an integer equal to the third input minus the sum of half of all even integers in the even list, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 1, i is 2, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is x - 1, otherwise a[i + 1], ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x), gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, odd is a list containing the value of gap, and stdin contains t - 6 test cases.**

The code appends the value of gap to the list odd. The value of gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains t - 6 test cases.
