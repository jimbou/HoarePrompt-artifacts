Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to the third input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 2, i is x + 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is x - 1 else a[i + 1], gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, odd is a list containing the current value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and odd, otherwise a list containing gap if gap is greater than 1 and odd is empty, otherwise an empty list, even is a list containing gap if gap is greater than 0 and even, otherwise a list containing gap and the previous value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is even, otherwise a list containing gap if gap is greater than 0 and even is empty, otherwise an empty list, and ans is an integer equal to x - 1 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x + 1) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, next_elem is a[0] + n if i is x - 1 else a[i + 1], and gap is next_elem - a[i] - 1. If gap is greater than 0 and gap is even, even has been appended with the value of gap.***
