Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is an integer equal to x - 1 if t1 is in st or t2 is not in st, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x, `st` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `t1` is an integer equal to (a[2] + 1) % n, `t2` is an integer equal to (a[2] + 2) % n, stdin contains t - 2 test cases.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` was x - 2 if t1 is in st or t2 is not in st, otherwise it was x - 1. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is x - 1 if t1 is in st or t2 is not in st, otherwise it is x. The values of the other variables are not affected.
