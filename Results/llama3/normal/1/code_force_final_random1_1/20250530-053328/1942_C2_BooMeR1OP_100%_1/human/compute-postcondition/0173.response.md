The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `x`, `x` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `x` so `i` is `x` and `x` must be greater than `x`. This is impossible so the loop cannot execute again. However, we can adjust the state to reflect the next possible iteration. For the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `x` so `i` is `x` and `x` must be greater than `x`. This is impossible so the loop cannot execute again. However, we can adjust the state to reflect the next possible iteration.
