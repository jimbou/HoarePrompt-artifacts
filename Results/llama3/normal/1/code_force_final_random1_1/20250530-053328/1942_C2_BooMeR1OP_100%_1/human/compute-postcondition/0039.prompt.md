Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, stdin contains t - 2 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
        odd.append(gap)
    elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
        even.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, `st` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `odd` is a list containing the current value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and is odd, otherwise it is an empty list, `even` is a list containing the integer `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and is even, otherwise it is an empty list, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1`, otherwise `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is an integer equal to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, `st` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1`, otherwise `a[i + 1]`, and `gap` is an integer equal to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases. If `gap` is greater than 1 and is odd, `odd` contains the current value of `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and is even, `even` contains the integer `gap`. Otherwise, `odd` and `even` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 2, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is 2, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1, otherwise a[i + 1], and gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, and stdin contains t - 2 test cases. If gap is greater than 1 and is odd, odd contains the current value of gap. If gap is greater than 0 and is even, even contains the current value of gap. Otherwise, both odd and even are empty lists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
