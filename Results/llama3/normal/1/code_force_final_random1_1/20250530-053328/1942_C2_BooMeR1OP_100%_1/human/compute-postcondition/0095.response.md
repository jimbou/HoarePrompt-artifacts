Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the second input, x is at least 1, y is an integer equal to the third input minus the sum of half of all even integers in the even list, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 1, i is 0, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[i + 1], if gap is greater than 0 and even, then gap is added to the even list, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x), and stdin contains t - 4 test cases.**
