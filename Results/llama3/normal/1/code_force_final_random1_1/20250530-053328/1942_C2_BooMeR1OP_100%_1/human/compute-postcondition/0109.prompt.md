Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the second input, x is an integer equal to the second input, y is an integer equal to the third input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 1, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is the last even integer in the list even, odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, stdin contains t - 4 test cases, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x), and y is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of half of all even integers in the even list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
        odd.append(gap)
    elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
        even.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the second input, x is at least 1, y is an integer equal to the third input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 1, i is 0, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[i + 1], ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x), and stdin contains t - 4 test cases. If gap is greater than 1 and odd, then odd is a list containing the current value of gap. If gap is greater than 0 and even, then gap is added to the even list. y is an integer equal to its original value minus the sum of half of all even integers in the even list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the second input, x is at least 2, y is an integer equal to the third input minus the sum of half of all even integers in the even list, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 1, i is 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is x - 1, otherwise a[i + 1], ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x), gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, and stdin contains t - 4 test cases. If gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1, then odd is a list containing the value of gap. If gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0, then even is a list of integers equal to the previous list of even integers plus the gap, and stdin contains t - 5 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the second input, x is at least 3, y is an integer equal to the third input minus the sum of half of all even integers in the even list, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 1, i is 2, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is x - 1, otherwise a[i + 1], ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x), gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1. If gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1, then odd is a list containing the value of gap and stdin contains t - 6 test cases. If gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0, then even is a list of integers equal to the previous list of even integers plus the gap and stdin contains t - 6 test cases. Otherwise, no changes are made to even and stdin contains t - 5 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
