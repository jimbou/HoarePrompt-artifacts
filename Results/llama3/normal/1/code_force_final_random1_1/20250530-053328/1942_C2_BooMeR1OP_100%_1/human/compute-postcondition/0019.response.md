Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is 0, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1, otherwise a[i + 1], gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to the variables `next_elem` and `gap`. The first line assigns the value of `a[0] + n` to `next_elem` if `i` is equal to `x - 1`, otherwise it assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to `next_elem`. The second line assigns the value of `next_elem - a[i] - 1` to `gap`. 

The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`, `st`, `_`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`, `odd`, and `even` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `stdin` also remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. 

The final state includes the new variables `next_elem` and `gap` with their assigned values, along with the unchanged values of the other variables.
