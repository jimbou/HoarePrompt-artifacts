Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, x is an integer equal to the second input, y is an integer equal to the third input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 2, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, otherwise ans remains unchanged, gap is the first odd gap in the list, odd is a sorted list containing all values of gap if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1, even is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
    t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
    if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, x is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than 0, y is an integer equal to the third input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 2, i is 0, t1 is an integer equal to (a[0] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[0] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, otherwise ans remains unchanged plus 1 if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, gap is the first odd gap in the list, odd is a sorted list containing all values of gap if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1, even is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, x is an integer greater than 1, y is an integer equal to the third input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 2, i is 2, t1 is an integer equal to (a[2] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[2] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, otherwise ans remains unchanged plus 1 if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, otherwise ans remains unchanged, gap is the first odd gap in the list, odd is a sorted list containing all values of gap if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1, even is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `x` is an integer greater than 3, `y` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, `st` is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in `a`, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[3] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[3] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all `i` in range(`x`) plus 2 times the original value of `y` if `y < gap // 2`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged plus 1 if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `gap` is the first odd gap in the list, `odd` is a sorted list containing all values of `gap` if `gap > 1` and `gap % 2 == 1`, `even` is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
