This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is the total number of elements, x is the number of distinct integers provided, and y is a value used for calculations. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function processes each test case by calculating a value 'ans' based on the provided integers and the value of y. It then prints the calculated value of 'ans' for each test case. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.
