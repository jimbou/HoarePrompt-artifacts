Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y, where 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 <= y <= n - x. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer that represents the number of test cases. The stdin contains `t-1` test cases because one test case has been read and processed. Each test case still consists of two lines, with the first line containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` within the specified ranges, and the second line containing `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
