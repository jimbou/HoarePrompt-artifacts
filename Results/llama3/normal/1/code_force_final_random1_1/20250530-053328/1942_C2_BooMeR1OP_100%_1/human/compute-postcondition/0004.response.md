Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is an integer equal to x - 2, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is 0, t1 is an integer equal to (a[0] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[0] + 2) % n, stdin contains t - 2 test cases**

The code snippet assigns the value of `(a[i] + 1) % n` to `t1` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` to `t2`. Since `i` is 0, `t1` becomes `(a[0] + 1) % n` and `t2` becomes `(a[0] + 2) % n`. No other variables are affected.
