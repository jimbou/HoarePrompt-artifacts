Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, x is an integer equal to the second input, y is an integer equal to the third input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 2, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, otherwise ans remains unchanged, gap is the first odd gap in the list, odd is an empty list, even is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
        odd.append(gap)
    elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
        even.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to the third input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 2, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[i + 1], gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1. If gap is greater than 1 and odd, then odd is a list containing the current value of gap, even is an empty list, and ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2. If gap is not greater than 1 or gap is even, then odd is an empty list, even is a list containing gap if gap is greater than 0 and even, otherwise even is an empty list, and ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2 and gap is greater than 0 and even, otherwise ans remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to the third input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 2, i is x, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is x - 1 else a[i + 1], gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, odd is a list containing the current value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and odd, otherwise a list containing gap if gap is greater than 1 and odd is empty, otherwise an empty list, even is a list containing gap if gap is greater than 0 and even, otherwise a list containing gap and the previous value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is even, otherwise a list containing gap if gap is greater than 0 and even is empty, otherwise an empty list, and ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer equal to the third input, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 2, i is x + 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is x - 1 else a[i + 1], gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, odd is a list containing the current value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and odd, otherwise a list containing gap if gap is greater than 1 and odd is empty, otherwise an empty list, even is a list containing gap if gap is greater than 0 and even, otherwise a list containing gap and the previous value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is even, otherwise a list containing gap if gap is greater than 0 and even is empty, otherwise an empty list, and ans is an integer equal to x - 1 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x + 1) plus 2 times the original value of y if y < gap // 2, next_elem is a[0] + n if i is x - 1 else a[i + 1], and gap is next_elem - a[i] - 1. If gap is greater than 1 and gap is odd, odd has been appended with the value of gap. If gap is greater than 0 and gap is even, even has been appended with the value of gap.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
