Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `st` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next even integer in the list `even` which is greater than the current `gap`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is a sorted list containing at least three elements, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times `y` if `y` is less than half of `gap`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus the previous `gap`, and `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the previous `gap` if `y` is less than half of `gap`, otherwise `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the previous `gap`.**
