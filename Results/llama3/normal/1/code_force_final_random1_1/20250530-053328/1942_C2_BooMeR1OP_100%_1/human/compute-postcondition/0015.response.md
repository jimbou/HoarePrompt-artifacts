Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 1, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 if t1 is in st or t2 is not in st, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 1 if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is 2, t1 is an integer equal to (a[2] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[2] + 2) % n, stdin contains t - 2 test cases.***
