Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 1`, `st` is a set of integers, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[1] + 2) % n`, stdin contains `t - 2` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to `x - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t - 2` test cases.
