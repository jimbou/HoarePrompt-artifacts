Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer equal to the second input, x is an integer equal to the second input, y is an integer equal to the third input minus the sum of half of all even integers in the even list, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the input list with each number decremented by 1, st is a set of integers equal to the set of numbers in a, _ is 1, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all i in range(x), gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, odd is a sorted list containing the value of gap if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1 that must have at least 1 odd gap, even is a sorted list of integers equal to the previous list of even integers plus the gap if gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0, gap is the first odd gap in the list, and the current value of y is less than half of the current value of gap.**
