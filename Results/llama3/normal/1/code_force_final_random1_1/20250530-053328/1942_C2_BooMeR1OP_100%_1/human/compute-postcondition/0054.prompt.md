Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, odd is a sorted list containing the current value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and is odd, even is a sorted list containing the current value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, and stdin contains t - 2 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of gap, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st plus gap, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is an integer greater than 1 and is odd, odd is a sorted list containing at least one element which is the current value of gap, even is a sorted list containing the current value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, and stdin contains t - 2 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is an integer greater than 1 and is odd and is the next odd integer in the odd list, odd is a sorted list containing at least one more element, even is a sorted list containing the current value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times the original value of y plus gap, and y is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, _ is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is an integer greater than 1 and is odd and is the next odd integer in the odd list, odd is a sorted list containing at least two more elements, even is a sorted list containing the current value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times the original value of y plus gap, and y is -gap // 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
