Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n, such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program provided uses a simple if-else statement to determine the minimum number of cells to be colored.

If 4n - 2 equals k, it means that all diagonals need to be colored, and the minimum number of cells required is k // 2 + 1. This is because each diagonal has two cells that can be colored, and we need to color at least one cell in each diagonal.

If 4n - 2 does not equal k, it means that not all diagonals need to be colored. In this case, the minimum number of cells required is ceil(k / 2). This is because we can color one cell in each of the k diagonals, and the ceiling function ensures that we round up to the nearest integer if k is odd.

The program correctly handles both cases and prints the minimum number of cells required.

Correctness: **True**
