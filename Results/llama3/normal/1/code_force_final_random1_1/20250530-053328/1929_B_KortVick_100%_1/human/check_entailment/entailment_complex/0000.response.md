Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n, such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The given program attempts to solve this problem by iterating over each test case and printing the minimum number of cells that need to be colored.

The program first checks if 4n - 2 equals k. If this condition is true, it prints k // 2 + 1. Otherwise, it prints the ceiling of k divided by 2.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* If 4n - 2 equals k, it means that all diagonals need to be colored. In this case, the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is k // 2 + 1, because each diagonal has at least one colored cell, and there are k // 2 diagonals with two colored cells.
* If 4n - 2 does not equal k, it means that not all diagonals need to be colored. In this case, the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is the ceiling of k divided by 2, because each diagonal has at least one colored cell, and there are k // 2 diagonals with one colored cell.

The program correctly implements this logic and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
