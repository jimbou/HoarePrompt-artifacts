To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't need a specific value, but its existence is necessary for the loop to execute).

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), it already satisfies this condition. However, we need to explicitly state this in the adjusted state.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^8, 1 <= `k` <= 4`n` - 2), `_` exists**
