Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^8, 1 <= `k` <= 4`n` - 2), `_` exists**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the first line of input in stdin, which contains two integers. The value of `t` remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The range of values for `n` and `k` is still valid, as they are assigned from the input. The existence of `_` is also still valid, as it is not affected by the code.
