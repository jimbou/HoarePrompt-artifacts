Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:

The program does not handle the case when k is equal to 4n - 2 correctly. In this case, the program prints k // 2 + 1, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be n.

For example, when n = 3 and k = 10, the program prints 6, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 3.

The correct code should handle this case separately and print n when k is equal to 4n - 2.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
```

This corrected code will handle all cases correctly.
