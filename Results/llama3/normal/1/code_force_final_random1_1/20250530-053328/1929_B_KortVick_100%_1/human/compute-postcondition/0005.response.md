The code prints the value of `k // 2 + 1`, where `k` is equal to 4 times the current value of `n` minus 2.
Since `k` is equal to 4 times the current value of `n` minus 2, we can substitute this expression into the print statement to get `4 * n // 2 - 2 // 2 + 1`.
Simplifying this expression, we get `2 * n - 1 + 1`, which is equal to `2 * n`.
Therefore, the code prints the value of `2 * n`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive).
Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer equal to 4`n` - 2, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^8, 1 <= `k` <= 4`n` - 2), `_` exists, and the current value of `k` is equal to 4 times the current value of `n` minus 2, and the value of `2 * n` is being printed**
