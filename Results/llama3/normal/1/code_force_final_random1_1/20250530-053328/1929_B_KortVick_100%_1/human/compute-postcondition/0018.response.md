Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are reassigned to the values from the second line of input, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^8, 1 <= `k` <= 4`n` - 2), `_` exists.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the values from the second line of input. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, because one line of input has been consumed by the `input().split()` function. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
