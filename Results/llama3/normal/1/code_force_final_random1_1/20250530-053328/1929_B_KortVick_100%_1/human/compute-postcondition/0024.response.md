Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to 0, `n` and `k` are reassigned to the values from the last line of input, stdin is empty, `_` exists. If `4 * n - 2` equals `k`, the value of `k // 2 + 1` which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^8 (inclusive) is being printed. Otherwise, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all input lines have been processed. The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last line of input. The standard input (stdin) will be empty, as all lines have been read. The variable `_` will still exist, although its value is not specified. The loop will print either `k // 2 + 1` (if `k` equals `4 * n - 2`) or the ceiling of `k` divided by 2, depending on the values of `n` and `k`.
