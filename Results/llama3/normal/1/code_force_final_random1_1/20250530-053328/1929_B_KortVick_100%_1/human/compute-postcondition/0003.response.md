Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer equal to 4`n` - 2, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^8, 1 <= `k` <= 4`n` - 2), `_` exists, and the current value of `k` is equal to 4 times the current value of `n` minus 2.**
