The code prints the value of `k // 2 + 1`, which is the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), the value of `k // 2 + 1` will be an integer between 1 and 2`n` (inclusive).

Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are reassigned to the values from the second line of input, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^8, 1 <= `k` <= 4`n` - 2), `_` exists, and the value of `k // 2 + 1` which is an integer between 1 and 2`n` (inclusive) is being printed**
