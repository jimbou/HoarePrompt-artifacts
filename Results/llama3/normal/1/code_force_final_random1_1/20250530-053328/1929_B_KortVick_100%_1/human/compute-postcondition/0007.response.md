The code prints the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2.
Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), and 4 * n - 2 is not equal to k, the value of `k` will always be less than 4 * n - 2.
The ceiling of the division of `k` by 2 will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k` divided by 2.
Output: **the ceiling of the division of k by 2 (where k is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2)**
