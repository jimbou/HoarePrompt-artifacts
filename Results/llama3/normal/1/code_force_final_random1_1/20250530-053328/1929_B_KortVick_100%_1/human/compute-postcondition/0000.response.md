Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^8, 1 <= `k` <= 4`n` - 2)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of input, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin still contains `t` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), and `k` is between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive).
