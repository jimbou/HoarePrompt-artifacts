The code prints the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`, where `k` is an integer equal to 4 times the current value of `n` minus 2.

Since `k` is equal to 4 times the current value of `n` minus 2, we can substitute this expression into the print statement: `print((4 * n - 2) // 2 + 1)`.

Now, let's simplify the expression: `(4 * n - 2) // 2 + 1` is equivalent to `2 * n - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `2 * n`.

Therefore, the code prints the result of `2 * n`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive).

Output: **2 times the current value of n (where n is an integer between 2 and 10^8)**
