Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and k. It then iterates t times, processing each pair of n and k values. If 4n-2 equals k, it prints k//2 + 1; otherwise, it prints the ceiling of k divided by 2. After processing all input lines, the function leaves stdin empty and reassigns n and k to the values from the last line of input.**
