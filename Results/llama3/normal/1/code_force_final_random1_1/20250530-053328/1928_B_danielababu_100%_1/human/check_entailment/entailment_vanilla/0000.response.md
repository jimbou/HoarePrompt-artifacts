To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step.

**Problem Analysis:**

The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in an array after adding a permutation to the array. The permutation is an array of distinct integers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the array.

**Code Analysis:**

The provided code consists of several functions (func_1 to func_9) that perform various tasks such as reading input, sorting arrays, and calculating prefix products. However, none of these functions directly address the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in an array after adding a permutation.

The code seems to be a collection of utility functions, but it lacks the main logic to solve the problem. There is no function that takes an array as input, adds a permutation to it, and then finds the maximum frequency of any element.

**Correctness:**

Based on the analysis, it is clear that the provided code does not solve the problem as described. The code is incomplete and lacks the necessary logic to address the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the given Python program is:

Correctness: **False**
