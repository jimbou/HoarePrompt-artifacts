#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0).
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer greater than 0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer from standard input and returns it, ensuring the returned value is greater than 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, which are the result of converting each string in the space-separated list of integers from stdin into an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns a map object containing the converted integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a list of space-separated integers.
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were space-separated in the stdin input.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns them as a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were in the stdin, sorted in ascending order.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of strings.
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a space-separated list of strings from the standard input, where each string is converted to a string type.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of strings from the standard input, converts each string to a string type, and returns a map object containing the converted strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string of characters
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the string in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a string of characters from standard input and returns it as a list of characters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of strings.
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a list of strings from stdin, sorted in ascending order, where each string is a space-separated element from the original input.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of strings from standard input, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

    return ans
    #The program returns a list containing the cumulative products of all elements in the list 'arr', where 'arr' is a list of non-negative integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a list of cumulative products of all elements in the input list 'arr', which contains non-negative integers. The function does not modify the input list 'arr'. The returned list contains the product of all elements up to each index in 'arr'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.

    return ans
    #The program returns a list containing the product of all elements of arr, where arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the product of all elements in a given list of non-negative integers and returns the result as a list. The input list must contain at least one element. The function does not modify the original list.
