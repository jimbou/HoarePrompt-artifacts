Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, the product of the last element of arr, the second last element of arr and 1, and the product of the last element of arr, the second last element of arr, the third last element of arr and 1, tem is the product of the last element of arr, the second last element of arr, the third last element of arr and 1, i is the third last index of the list**

The code multiplies the current value of `tem` by the element at index `i` in `arr` and appends the result to `ans`. Since `tem` is initially the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr`, and 1, and `i` is the third last index of the list, the new value of `tem` becomes the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr`, the third last element of `arr`, and 1. The list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr`, the third last element of `arr`, and 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the third last index of the list.
