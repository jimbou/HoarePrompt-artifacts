Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not attempt to solve the problem described. It contains various functions for reading input, sorting, and performing other tasks, but it does not contain any logic to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array.

A correct solution would involve sorting the array, then iterating through the array to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation. The code provided does not contain any such logic, and therefore it is incorrect.
