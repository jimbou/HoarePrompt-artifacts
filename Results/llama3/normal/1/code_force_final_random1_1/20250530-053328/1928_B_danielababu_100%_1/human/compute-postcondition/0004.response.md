Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, and the product of the last element of arr, the second last element of arr and 1, tem is the product of the last element of arr, the second last element of arr and 1, i is the second last index of the list**

The first line of the code multiplies the current value of `tem` by the value of `arr[i]`, which is the second last element of the list. Since `tem` was initially the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, it now becomes the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr`, and 1.

The second line appends the updated value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contained only the product of the last element of `arr` and 1. Now, it also includes the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr`, and 1.

The value of `i` remains unchanged as the second last index of the list. The list `arr` itself is not modified by the code.

Therefore, the final state includes the updated values of `tem` and `ans`, while `arr` and `i` retain their initial values.
