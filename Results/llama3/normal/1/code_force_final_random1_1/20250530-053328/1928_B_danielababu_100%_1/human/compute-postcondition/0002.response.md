Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, tem is the product of the last element of arr and 1, i is the last index of the list**

The code multiplies the current value of `tem` (which is 1) by the last element of the list `arr` (located at index `i`) and assigns the result back to `tem`. Then, it appends the new value of `tem` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the last index of the list `arr`.
