The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, ans is an empty list and tem is 1. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the i is the last index of the list.
State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is an empty list, tem is 1, i is the last index of the list**
