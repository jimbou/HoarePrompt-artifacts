Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in an array after adding a permutation to the array. The program uses a combination of functions to read input, sort the array, and calculate the maximum number of elements that can be equal to the same number.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and the length of the array correctly using `func_1()` and `func_3()`.
2. The program sorts the array in ascending order using the `sorted()` function and removes duplicates by converting the list to a set.
3. The program calculates the maximum number of elements that can be equal to the same number by iterating through the sorted array and using the `bisect_left()` function to find the insertion point for each element in the array. The `bisect_left()` function returns the index where the element should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
4. The program updates the maximum count `ans` by comparing the difference between the insertion point and the current index `i` with the current maximum count.

Based on the execution summaries provided, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The `bisect_left()` function is used correctly to find the insertion point, and the maximum count is updated correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
