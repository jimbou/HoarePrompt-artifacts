To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from the last index of the list `arr` to the first index, decrementing by 1 each time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the last index of the list. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1.

The state of `arr` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `ans` and `tem` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust them.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, `tem` is the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, `i` is the second last index of the list**
