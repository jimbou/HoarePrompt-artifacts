To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):`, which means the loop will iterate from the second last index of `arr` to the first index in reverse order.

The current state is:

* `arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element.
* `ans` is a list containing the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, and the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr` and 1.
* `tem` is the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr` and 1.
* `i` is the second last index of the list.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head. The loop will execute again if `i` is greater than -1 (since the range starts from `len(arr) - 1` and ends at `-1`).

Since `i` is currently the second last index of the list, we need to decrement it by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, the new state of `i` will be the third last index of the list (or the last index if the list has only 2 elements).

The state of `arr` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The state of `ans` and `tem` is not directly related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust their state based on the loop head alone. However, we can infer that `ans` will continue to grow by appending new products, and `tem` will be updated accordingly.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is a list containing the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, and the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr` and 1, `tem` is the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr` and 1, `i` is the third last index of the list**
