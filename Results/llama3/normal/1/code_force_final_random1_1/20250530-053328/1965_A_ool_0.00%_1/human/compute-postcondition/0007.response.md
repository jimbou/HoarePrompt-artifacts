Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers, A is False, the first element of arr is 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 2 elements, not_c is False, i is 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `not_c = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `not_c`, changing its initial state from `True` to `False`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or the nearest enclosing loop. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged because the code does not modify them. The list `arr` remains a list of positive integers with its first element being 1. The variable `A` stays `False`. The list `set_` continues to be a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 2 elements. The variable `i` retains its value of 1. The condition regarding the difference between the elements at indices `i` and `i-1` in `set_` being greater than 1 also remains valid as it is not affected by the executed code.
