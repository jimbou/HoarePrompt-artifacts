Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game based on the properties of a list of positive integers. If the first element of the list is not 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks if the list contains consecutive integers. If the list does not contain consecutive integers, the function returns 'Alice'. If the list does contain consecutive integers, the function returns 'Alice' if the number of unique integers in the list is even, and 'Bob' otherwise.**
