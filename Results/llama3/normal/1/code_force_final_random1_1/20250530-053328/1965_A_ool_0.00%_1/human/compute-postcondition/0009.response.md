Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is True, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `set_` and the first element of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, containing only positive integers with the first element being 1. The variable `A` is now True, having been toggled from its initial False state. The sorted list `set_` continues to hold unique positive integers from `arr`, ensuring it has at least two elements. The value of `i` remains 1. The condition related to `not_c` also remains unchanged, depending on the difference between the second and first elements of `set_`.
