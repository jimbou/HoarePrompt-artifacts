    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: arr is a list of positive integers, A is True if the length of set_ is even, otherwise A is False, the first element of arr is 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, if not_c is True, then the difference between any two consecutive elements in set_ is not greater than 1. Otherwise, not_c is False and the difference between any two consecutive elements in set_ is greater than 1.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns either 'Alice' if the length of set_ is even, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. The length of set_ is the number of unique positive integers in the list arr.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the winner of a game based on the properties of a list of positive integers. If the first element of the list is not 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks if the list contains consecutive integers. If the list does not contain consecutive integers, the function returns 'Alice'. If the list does contain consecutive integers, the function returns 'Alice' if the number of unique integers in the list is even, and 'Bob' otherwise.
