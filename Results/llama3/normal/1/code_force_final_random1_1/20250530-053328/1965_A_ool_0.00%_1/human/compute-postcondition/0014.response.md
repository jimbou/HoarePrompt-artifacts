To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(set_)):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to the length of `set_` (exclusive).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `arr` is a list of positive integers, the first element of `arr` is 1.
- `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements.
- `i` is 2.
- `A` is False.
- If the difference between the second and first elements of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `set_`.

1. **Adjusting `i`**: Since `i` is currently 2 and the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` should be 3 for the loop to execute again.

2. **Adjusting `set_`**: The loop condition depends on `len(set_)`. Since `i` is incremented and needs to be within the range from 1 to `len(set_)`, and given that `i` is to be 3, `set_` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again. This is because the range is exclusive of the end value, so `len(set_)` must be at least 4 for `i` to reach 3.

The other variables (`arr`, `A`, and the condition related to `not_c`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `A` is False, If the difference between the second and first elements of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False.**
