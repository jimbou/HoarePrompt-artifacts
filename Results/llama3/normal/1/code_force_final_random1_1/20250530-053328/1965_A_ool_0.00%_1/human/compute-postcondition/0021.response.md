Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers, A is True if the length of set_ is even, otherwise A is False, the first element of arr is 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, not_c is True, and the difference between any two consecutive elements in set_ is not greater than 1.**

In this output state, the value of A has been changed to its opposite, i.e., if the length of set_ is even, A is now True, and if the length of set_ is odd, A is now False. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
