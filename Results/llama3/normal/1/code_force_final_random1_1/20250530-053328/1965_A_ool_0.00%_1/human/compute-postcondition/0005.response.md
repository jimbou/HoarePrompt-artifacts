The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and set_, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set_.  If the set_ has at least 2 elements the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, A is False, the first element of arr is 1, not_c is True. So for the loop to be executed  the set_ must have at least 2 elements and the i is 1.
State: **arr is a list of positive integers, A is False, the first element of arr is 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 2 elements, not_c is True, i is 1**
