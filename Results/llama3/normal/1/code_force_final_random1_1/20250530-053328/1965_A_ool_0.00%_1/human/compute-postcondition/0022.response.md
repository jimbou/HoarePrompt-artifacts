Postcondition: **arr is a list of positive integers, A is True if the length of set_ is even, otherwise A is False, the first element of arr is 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, if not_c is True, then the difference between any two consecutive elements in set_ is not greater than 1. Otherwise, not_c is False and the difference between any two consecutive elements in set_ is greater than 1.**
