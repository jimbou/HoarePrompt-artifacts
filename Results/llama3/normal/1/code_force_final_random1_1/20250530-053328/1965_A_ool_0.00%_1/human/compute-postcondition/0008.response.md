Postcondition: ***arr is a list of positive integers, A is False, the first element of arr is 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 2 elements, i is 1. If the difference between the second element of set_ and the first element of set_ is greater than 1, then not_c is False. Otherwise, not_c remains True.***
