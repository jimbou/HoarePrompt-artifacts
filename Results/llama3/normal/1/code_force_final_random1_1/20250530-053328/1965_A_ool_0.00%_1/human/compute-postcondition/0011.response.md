Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers, A is True, the first element of arr is 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 3 elements, i is 2, not_c is False**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `not_c = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `not_c`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that is typically used to exit a loop prematurely. However, in this context, since there is no loop provided in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, the only change to the initial state is the introduction of the variable `not_c` with the value `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
