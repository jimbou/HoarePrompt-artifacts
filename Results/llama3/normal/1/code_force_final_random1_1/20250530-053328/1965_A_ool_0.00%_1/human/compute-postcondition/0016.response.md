Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `A` is False. If the difference between the second and first elements of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
