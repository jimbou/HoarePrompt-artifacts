Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `A` is False, If the difference between the second and first elements of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `A` has been changed to False, while the other variables remain unchanged. The first element of `arr` is still 1, and `set_` is still a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 3 elements. The value of `i` is still 2. The condition regarding `not_c` remains the same, depending on the difference between the second and first elements of `set_`.
