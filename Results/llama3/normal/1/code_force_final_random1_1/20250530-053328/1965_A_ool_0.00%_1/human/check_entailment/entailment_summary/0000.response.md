Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the properties of the list of positive integers. The program first checks if the first element of the list is not 1, in which case it immediately returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks if the list contains consecutive integers. If the list does not contain consecutive integers, the function returns 'Alice'. If the list does contain consecutive integers, the function returns 'Alice' if the number of unique integers in the list is even, and 'Bob' otherwise. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
