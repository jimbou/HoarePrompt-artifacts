Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers, A is False, the first element of arr is 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, not_c is True.**

In this output state, the initial state of `arr`, `A`, and the first element of `arr` remain unchanged. The code introduces two new variables: `set_` and `not_c`. The `set_` variable is assigned a sorted list of unique positive integers from the original `arr` list, and `not_c` is set to `True`.
