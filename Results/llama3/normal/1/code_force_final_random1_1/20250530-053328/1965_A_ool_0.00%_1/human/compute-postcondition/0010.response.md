To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(set_)):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `set_`. Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

The length of `set_` must also be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute again. Currently, `set_` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `set_` must have at least 3 elements.

The other variables (`arr`, `A`, `not_c`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is True, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
