You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9).
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        stop = False
        
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        
        if stop == True:
            continue
        
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is 0, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is n - 2, stdin contains 0 test cases, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is decreased by three times the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i]. If stop is True, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the last element of a is not 0 or the second last element of a is not 0, 'NO' is printed. If the last two elements of the list a are both 0, 'YES' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is 0, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is n - 2, stdin contains 0 test cases, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is decreased by three times the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i]. If stop is True, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the last element of a is not 0 or the second last element of a is not 0, 'NO' is printed. If the last two elements of the list a are both 0, 'YES' is printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
