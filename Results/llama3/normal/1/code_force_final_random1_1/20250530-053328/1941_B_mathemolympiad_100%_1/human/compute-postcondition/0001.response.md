To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and `numTest`. 

For the loop to execute, `numTest` must be at least 1, since the loop iterates from 0 to `numTest`. 

State: **`numTest` is an integer (1 <= `numTest` <= 10^4), stdin contains `numTest`-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9), _ is 0**
