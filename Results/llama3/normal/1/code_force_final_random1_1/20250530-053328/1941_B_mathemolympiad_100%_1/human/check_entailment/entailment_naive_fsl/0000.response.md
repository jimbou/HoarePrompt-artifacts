Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

4
1 2 7 2

The program will output "NO", but it should output "YES" because it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the elements of the array can be made zero by applying the operation from left to right. However, the problem statement allows the operation to be applied any number of times, and it does not specify the order in which the operations must be applied.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible sequences of operations that can be applied to the array.
