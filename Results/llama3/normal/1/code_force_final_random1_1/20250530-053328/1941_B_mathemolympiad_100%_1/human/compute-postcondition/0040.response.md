Postcondition: ***numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9) with modified elements, i is 0, if a[i] is less than 0, then stop is True, otherwise, stop remains False, stdin contains numTest - 4 test cases.***
