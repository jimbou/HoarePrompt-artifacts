The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is within the range 0 to `n - 3`, `n` is an integer (3 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is within the range 1 to `n - 2`. 

State: **numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is within the range 1 to n - 2, stdin contains numTest - 5 test cases, a[i] is an integer, a[i + 1] is decreased by three times the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i]**
