Postcondition: ***numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is 2. If a[i] is less than 0, then stop is True, 'NO' is printed, and stdin contains numTest - 5 test cases. Otherwise, stop remains False.***
