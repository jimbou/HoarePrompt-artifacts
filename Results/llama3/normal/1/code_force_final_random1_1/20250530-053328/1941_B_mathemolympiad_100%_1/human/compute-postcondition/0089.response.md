Postcondition: ***numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is n - 2, stdin contains numTest - 5 test cases, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is decreased by three times the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i]. If stop is True, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
