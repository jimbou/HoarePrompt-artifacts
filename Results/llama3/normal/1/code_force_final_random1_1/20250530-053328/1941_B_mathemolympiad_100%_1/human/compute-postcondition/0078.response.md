Postcondition: ***numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is within the range 1 to n - 2, stdin contains numTest - 5 test cases, a[i] is an integer, a[i + 1] is decreased by three times the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i]. If a[i] is less than 0, 'NO' is printed and stop is True. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
