The only variable in the loop head is variable  numTest, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numTest`. If `numTest` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numTest` is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4), stdin contains numTest - 2 test cases. For the loop to execute again numTest must be decreased by 1 and stdin contains numTest - 3 test cases.
State: **`numTest` is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and numTest is decreased by 1, stdin contains numTest - 3 test cases, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9) with modified elements, i is n - 2**
