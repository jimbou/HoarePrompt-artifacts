Output: **`numTest` is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4), `stdin` contains `numTest - 2` test cases, `n` is an integer (n > 4), `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9) with modified elements, `i` is 2, `stop` is False, 'NO' is not printed, `a[1]` is reduced by `opNum`, `a[2]` is reduced by 2 * `opNum`, `a[3]` is reduced by `opNum`, and 'NO' is printed**
