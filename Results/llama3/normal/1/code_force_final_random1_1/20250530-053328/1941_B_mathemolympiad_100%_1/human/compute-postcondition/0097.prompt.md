Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numTest` is an integer (1 <= `numTest` <= 10^4), stdin contains `numTest`-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(0, numTest):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    stop = False
    for i in range(0, n - 2):
        if a[i] < 0:
            print('NO')
            stop = True
            break
        opNum = a[i]
        a[i] -= opNum
        a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
        a[i + 2] -= opNum
    if stop == True:
        continue
    if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4), stdin contains numTest - 2 test cases, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9) with modified elements, i is n - 2. If stop is True, then any a[i] is negative, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is a[i + 1] - 2 * a[i], a[i + 2] is a[i + 2] - a[i] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If stop is False, then no action is taken. If the current value of a[len(a) - 1] is not 0 or the current value of a[len(a) - 2] is not 0, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the last two elements of a are 0, i.e., a[len(a) - 1] is 0 and a[len(a) - 2] is 0, then 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is n - 2, stdin contains numTest - 4 test cases, a[i] is decreased by its original value, a[i + 1] is decreased by twice the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i]. If the last element of a is not 0 or the second last element of a is not 0, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the last two elements of a are 0 (a[len(a) - 1] == 0 and a[len(a) - 2] == 0), 'YES' is printed. If stop is True, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of numTest, n, a, i, and stdin.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is n - 2, stdin contains numTest - 5 test cases, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is decreased by three times the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i]. If stop is True, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the last element of a is not 0 or the second last element of a is not 0, 'NO' is printed. If the last two elements of the list a are both 0, 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
