The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numTest`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9). After accepting the first integer, the stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9).

Output State: **`numTest` is an integer (1 <= `numTest` <= 10^4), stdin contains `numTest`-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9).**
