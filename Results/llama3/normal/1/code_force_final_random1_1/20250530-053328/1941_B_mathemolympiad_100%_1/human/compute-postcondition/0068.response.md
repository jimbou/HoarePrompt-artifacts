Postcondition: **`numTest` is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, `n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of `n` integers with modified elements, `i` is within the range 0 to `n - 3`, stdin contains `numTest - 5` test cases, `a[i]` is decreased by its original value, `a[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the original value of `a[i]`, `a[i + 2]` is decreased by the original value of `a[i]`, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than 0.**
