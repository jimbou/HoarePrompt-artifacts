Output: **`numTest` is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of `numTest` is decreased by 1, `n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9) with modified elements, `i` is 0, `stop` is False, stdin contains numTest - 4 test cases. The current value of `a[i]` is less than 0, and 'NO' is being printed**
