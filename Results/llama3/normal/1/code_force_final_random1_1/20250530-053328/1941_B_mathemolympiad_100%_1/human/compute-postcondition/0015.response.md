Output State: **numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4), stdin contains numTest - 2 test cases, n is an integer (n >= 3), a is a list of n integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9) with modified elements, i is 1, stop is False, 'NO' is not printed. a[1] is reduced by opNum, a[2] is reduced by 2 * opNum, a[3] is reduced by opNum.**

In this output state, the value of `numTest` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin also remains the same, as the code does not interact with stdin. The value of `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 3, as it is not modified by the code.

The list `a` is modified by the code. The value of `a[1]` is reduced by `opNum`, which is the value of `a[1]` before the reduction. The value of `a[2]` is reduced by 2 times `opNum`, and the value of `a[3]` is reduced by `opNum`. The value of `i` remains 1, as it is not modified by the code.

The variable `stop` remains False, as the code does not set it to True. The string 'NO' is not printed, as the condition for printing it is not met.
