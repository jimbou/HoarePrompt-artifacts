Output State: **numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4), stdin contains numTest - 2 test cases, n is an integer (n >= 3), a is a list of n integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9), i is 0, stop is True if a[0] is negative, otherwise stop is False. If stop is False, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is a[i + 1] - 2 * a[i], a[i + 2] is a[i + 2] - a[i].**

In this output state, the value of numTest remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The stdin still contains numTest - 2 test cases as no input operation is performed in the code. The value of n also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The list a is modified according to the operations performed in the code. If a[0] is negative, the stop variable becomes True and the value of i remains 0. Otherwise, the stop variable remains False. If stop is False, the value of a[i] becomes 0, a[i + 1] is decremented by 2 times the original value of a[i], and a[i + 2] is decremented by the original value of a[i].
