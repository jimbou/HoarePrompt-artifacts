Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then attempts to modify the list by subtracting a certain value from each element and its neighbors, in a way that makes the last two elements of the list equal to zero. If successful, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for each test case, and once all test cases have been processed, it terminates.**
