Output: **numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4), stdin contains numTest - 2 test cases, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9) with modified elements, i is n - 2. If stop is True, then any a[i] is negative, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is a[i + 1] - 2 * a[i], a[i + 2] is a[i + 2] - a[i] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If stop is False, then no action is taken. The current value of a[len(a) - 1] is not 0 or the current value of a[len(a) - 2] is not 0, and 'NO' is printed**
