Postcondition: **numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4), stdin contains numTest - 2 test cases, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9) with modified elements, i is n - 2, stop is True and any a[i] is negative, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is a[i + 1] - 2 * a[i], a[i + 2] is a[i + 2] - a[i].**
