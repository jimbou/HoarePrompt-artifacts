Output State: **numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is within the range 1 to n - 2, stdin contains numTest - 5 test cases, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is decreased by three times the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i]. If a[i] is less than 0, 'NO' is printed and stop is True. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been reduced to 0, and the values of `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` have been decreased by three times and one time the original value of `a[i]`, respectively. The value of `numTest` remains decreased by 1, and the range of `i` remains within 1 to `n - 2`. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `numTest - 5`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the list `a` contains modified elements. If the original value of `a[i]` was less than 0, 'NO' is printed and `stop` is set to `True`.
