Output State: **numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is within the range 2 to n - 1, stdin contains numTest - 5 test cases, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is decreased by three times the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i]. If a[i] is less than 0, 'NO' is printed and stop is True. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been reduced to 0, and `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` have been decreased by three times and one time the original value of `a[i]`, respectively. The value of `numTest` has been decreased by 1, and the number of test cases in stdin has also been reduced by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged. If the original value of `a[i]` was less than 0, 'NO' would have been printed and the program would have stopped, but since `a[i]` is now 0, no changes are made.
