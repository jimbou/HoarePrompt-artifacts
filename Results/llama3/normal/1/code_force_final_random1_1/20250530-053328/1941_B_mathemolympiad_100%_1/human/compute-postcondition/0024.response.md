Output State: **`numTest` is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4), stdin contains numTest - 2 test cases, `n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9) with modified elements, `i` is n - 2, `stop` is True and any a[i] is negative, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is a[i + 1] - 2 * a[i], a[i + 2] is a[i + 2] - a[i] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the program moves on to the next iteration.
