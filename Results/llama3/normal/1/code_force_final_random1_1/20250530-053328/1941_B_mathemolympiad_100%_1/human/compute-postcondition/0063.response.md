Output: **numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is n - 2, stdin contains numTest - 4 test cases, a[i] is decreased by its original value, a[i + 1] is decreased by twice the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i]. The last two elements of a are 0 (a[len(a) - 1] == 0 and a[len(a) - 2] == 0). If stop is True, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of numTest, n, a, i, and stdin. 'YES' is printed**
