Postcondition: ***numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4), stdin contains numTest - 2 test cases, n is an integer (n > 4), a is a list of n integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9) with modified elements, i is 2, if a[2] is less than 0, then stop is True and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state of variables***
