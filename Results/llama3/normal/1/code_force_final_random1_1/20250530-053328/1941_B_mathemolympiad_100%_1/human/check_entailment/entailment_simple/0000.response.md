Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement and checks if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using this operation.

The program iterates over the array from left to right, applying the operation at each index i (except the last two elements). It subtracts the value of a[i] from a[i], 2 times the value of a[i] from a[i+1], and the value of a[i] from a[i+2]. This is equivalent to applying the operation at index i.

After applying the operation at each index, the program checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are not, it prints "NO". If they are zero, it prints "YES".

The program also handles the case where the array has less than three elements correctly, as it will not attempt to access indices that are out of bounds.

The use of the `stop` variable is also correct, as it allows the program to skip to the next test case if it has already determined that the current test case is impossible.

Correctness: **True**
