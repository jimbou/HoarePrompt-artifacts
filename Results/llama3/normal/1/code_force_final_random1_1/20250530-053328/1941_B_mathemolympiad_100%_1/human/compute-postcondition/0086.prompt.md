Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is n - 2, stdin contains numTest - 5 test cases, a[i] is decreased by its original value, a[i + 1] is decreased by twice the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 2):
    if a[i] < 0:
        print('NO')
        stop = True
        break
    opNum = a[i]
    a[i] -= opNum
    a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
    a[i + 2] -= opNum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is within the range 0 to n - 3, stdin contains numTest - 5 test cases, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is decreased by three times the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i]. If the current value of a[i] is less than 0, 'NO' is printed, and stop is True. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is within the range 1 to n - 2, stdin contains numTest - 5 test cases, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is decreased by three times the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i]. If a[i] is less than 0, 'NO' is printed and stop is True. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: numTest is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, n is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a is a list of n integers with modified elements, i is within the range 2 to n - 1, stdin contains numTest - 5 test cases, a[i] is 0, a[i + 1] is decreased by three times the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i]. If a[i] is less than 0, 'NO' is printed and stop is True. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
