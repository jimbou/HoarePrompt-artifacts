Output State: **`numTest` is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and the current value of numTest is decreased by 1, `n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers with modified elements, `i` is n - 2, `stop` is True, stdin contains numTest - 4 test cases, a[i] is decreased by its original value, a[i + 1] is decreased by twice the original value of a[i], a[i + 2] is decreased by the original value of a[i], and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of numTest remains the same as it was decreased by 1 before the code was executed. The value of n remains the same. The list a still has n integers but with modified elements. The value of i remains the same as n - 2. The value of stop remains the same as True. The stdin still contains numTest - 4 test cases. The elements a[i], a[i + 1], and a[i + 2] still have the same modified values. The code skips to the next iteration of the loop, so the current iteration is skipped.
