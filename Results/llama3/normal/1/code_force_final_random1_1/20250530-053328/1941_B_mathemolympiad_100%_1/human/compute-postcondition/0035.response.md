To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 2, since the range is from 0 to `n - 2`. 

State: **`numTest` is an integer (0 <= numTest <= 10^4) and numTest is decreased by 1, `n` is an integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9) with modified elements, `i` is 0, `stop` is False, stdin contains numTest - 4 test cases**
