Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and k is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits, `l` is an integer representing the length of b and l is greater than lk + 2, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the binary value of k, `ans` is a list containing 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, 2^(lk + 1), 2^(lk + 2), `lk` is an integer representing the length of bk and lk is at least 21, `i` is lk + 2**

In this output state, the list `ans` has been updated by appending the value `2 ** i`, which is equivalent to `2^(lk + 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
