This function generates a list of a specified number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function 'func_7()'. The function takes one parameter, 'rows', which is a positive integer, and returns a list with 'rows' number of elements. The exact values of the elements in the list are determined by the implementation of 'func_7()', but the list will always have at least one element.
