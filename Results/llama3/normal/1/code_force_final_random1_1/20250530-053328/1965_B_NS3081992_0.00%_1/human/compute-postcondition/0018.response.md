The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, lk and l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `lk` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `lk`, `lk` is at least 21 and `l` is greater than `lk`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `lk + 1` and for the loop to execute again `l` must be greater than `lk + 1`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and k is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits, `l` is an integer representing the length of b and l is greater than lk + 1, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the binary value of k, `ans` is a list containing 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, `lk` is an integer representing the length of bk and lk is at least 21, `i` is lk + 1**
