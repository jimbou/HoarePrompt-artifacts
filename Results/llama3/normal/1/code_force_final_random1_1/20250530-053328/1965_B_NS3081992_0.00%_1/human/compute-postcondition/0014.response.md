Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits, `l` is an integer representing the length of `b`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the binary value of `k`, `ans` is a list containing 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, `lk` is an integer representing the length of `bk` and `lk` is at least 21, `i` is 20**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` and `l` remain unchanged, `bk` remains unchanged, `ans` contains a list of powers of 2 from 1 to 524288, `lk` is at least 21, and `i` is 20.
