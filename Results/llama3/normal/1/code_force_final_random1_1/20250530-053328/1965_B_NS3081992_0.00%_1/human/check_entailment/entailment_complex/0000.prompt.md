Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

The exact values of the elements in the list are unknown since the definition of 'func_3()' is not provided, but it is known that the list will have 'rows_number' number of elements, where 'rows_number' is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates a list of 'rows_number' elements, where each element is the result of calling 'func_3()', and returns this list. The length of the returned list is equal to the input 'rows_number', which is a positive integer.

The exact value of each element is unknown since the implementation of 'func_7()' is not provided, but it is known that 'rows' is a positive integer, so the list will have at least one element.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of a specified number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function 'func_7()'. The function takes one parameter, 'rows', which is a positive integer, and returns a list with 'rows' number of elements. The exact values of the elements in the list are determined by the implementation of 'func_7()', but the list will always have at least one element.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a string
    return input()
    #The program returns a string that was provided as input from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a string from standard input and returns it unchanged.

The length of the list associated with the key `da` in `d` is more than 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key `da` in a dictionary `d`, where the rank is determined by recursively exploring the values associated with `da` and updating the `rank` list accordingly. If the list associated with `da` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, temporarily marking each element as processed, and recursively calls `func_12` to calculate the minimum rank. The function then updates the `rank` list with the calculated minimum rank plus one and returns this value.

    #The program returns three values: y, x - a // b * y, and g. y is the second returned value of func_13(b, a % b), where a % b is the remainder of a divided by b. x - a // b * y is the first returned value of func_13(b, a % b) minus the product of the integer division of a by b and y. g is the third returned value of func_13(b, a % b).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, a and b, as input, where b is non-zero and a is greater than or equal to b, which is greater than or equal to 0. It returns a tuple of three values. If b is zero, the function returns 1, 0, and the original value of a. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function, func_13, with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns the second value of func_13, the first value of func_13 minus the product of the integer division of a by b and the second value of func_13, and the third value of func_13.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a string of space-separated powers of 2. If the input integer k is 1 and n is not 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it calculates the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l - 1), where lk is the length of the binary representation of k and is at least 21, and l is the length of the binary string b.
