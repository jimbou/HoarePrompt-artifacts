This function generates a string of space-separated powers of 2. If the input integer k is 1 and n is not 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it calculates the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l - 1), where lk is the length of the binary representation of k and is at least 21, and l is the length of the binary string b. The function then returns a string of these powers of 2, converted to strings and joined by spaces.
