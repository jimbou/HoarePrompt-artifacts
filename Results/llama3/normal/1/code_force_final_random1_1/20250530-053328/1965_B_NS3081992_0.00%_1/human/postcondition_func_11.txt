This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key `da` in a dictionary `d`, where the rank is determined by recursively exploring the values associated with `da` and updating the `rank` list accordingly. If the list associated with `da` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, temporarily marking each element as processed, and recursively calls `func_12` to calculate the minimum rank. The function then updates the `rank` list with the calculated minimum rank plus one and returns this value.
