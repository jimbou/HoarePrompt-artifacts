This function takes two integers, a and b, as input, where b is non-zero and a is greater than or equal to b, which is greater than or equal to 0. It returns a tuple of three values. If b is zero, the function returns 1, 0, and the original value of a. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function, func_13, with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns the second value of func_13, the first value of func_13 minus the product of the integer division of a by b and the second value of func_13, and the third value of func_13.
