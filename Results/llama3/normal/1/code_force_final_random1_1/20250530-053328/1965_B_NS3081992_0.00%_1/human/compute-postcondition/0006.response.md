Output State: **The output of `func_14()`, a non-negative integer, is printed to the console followed by a newline character, `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `func_14()` returns a non-negative integer.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the output of `func_14()` will have been printed to the console followed by a newline character, the number of times determined by the value returned by `func_10()`. The value returned by `func_10()` will be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `func_14()` will continue to return a non-negative integer.
