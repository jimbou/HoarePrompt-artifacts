To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution) and the function `func_10()`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 0, the loop will execute.

Since the loop body is omitted, we can't infer any additional information about the state of the program. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `func_10()` to ensure it returns a non-negative integer greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 0, `func_14()` returns a non-negative integer**
