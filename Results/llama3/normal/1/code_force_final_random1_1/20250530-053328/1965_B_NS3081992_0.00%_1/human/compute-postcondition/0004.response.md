The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and the return value of `func_10()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_10()`. If the return value of `func_10()` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the return value of `func_10()` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, the return value of `func_10()` must be greater than 2.

State: **The output of `func_14()`, a non-negative integer, is printed to the console followed by a newline character, `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 2, and `func_14()` returns a non-negative integer.**
