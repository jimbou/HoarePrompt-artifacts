To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(lk - 1):`. The objects involved are `i` and `lk`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `lk` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `lk - 1`. Since `i` is 0, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 1. Now, `i` is 1.

The loop will execute again if `i` (which is now 1) is less than `lk - 1`. This means `lk - 1` must be at least 2, which implies `lk` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits, `l` is an integer representing the length of `b`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the binary value of `k`, `ans` is a list containing 1, `lk` is an integer representing the length of `bk` and `lk` is at least 3, `i` is 1**
