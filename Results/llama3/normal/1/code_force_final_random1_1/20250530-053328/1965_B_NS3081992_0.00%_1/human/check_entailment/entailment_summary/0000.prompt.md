Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  Generates a list of 'rows_number' elements, where each element is the result of calling 'func_3()', and returns this list. The length of the returned list is equal to the input 'rows_number', which is a positive integer.

Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads a single line of input from the standard input (stdin), decodes it using UTF-8 encoding, removes the trailing newline character, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 7 :

 Output hints for function8:  This function generates a list of a specified number of elements, where each element is the result of calling the function 'func_7()'. The function takes one parameter, 'rows', which is a positive integer, and returns a list with 'rows' number of elements. The exact values of the elements in the list are determined by the implementation of 'func_7()', but the list will always have at least one element.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()

    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key `da` in a dictionary `d`, where the rank is determined by recursively exploring the values associated with `da` and updating the `rank` list accordingly. If the list associated with `da` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, temporarily marking each element as processed, and recursively calls `func_12` to calculate the minimum rank. The function then updates the `rank` list with the calculated minimum rank plus one and returns this value.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function takes two integers, a and b, as input, where b is non-zero and a is greater than or equal to b, which is greater than or equal to 0. It returns a tuple of three values. If b is zero, the function returns 1, 0, and the original value of a. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function, func_13, with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns the second value of func_13, the first value of func_13 minus the product of the integer division of a by b and the second value of func_13, and the third value of func_13.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:
            return '1\n2'
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    else:
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function generates a string of space-separated powers of 2. If the input integer k is 1 and n is not 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it calculates the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l - 1), where lk is the length of the binary representation of k and is at least 21, and l is the length of the binary string b. The function then returns a string of these powers of 2, converted to strings and joined by spaces.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  Prints a non-negative integer to the console a certain number of times, where the integer is determined by `func_14()` and the number of times is determined by `func_10()`. The output is followed by a newline character. The function does not return any value.
