The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `func_10()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the output of `func_10()`. If the output of `func_10()` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the output of `func_10()` must be greater than 1.
State: **`func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 1, `func_14()` returns a non-negative integer, and the output of `func_14()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character.**
