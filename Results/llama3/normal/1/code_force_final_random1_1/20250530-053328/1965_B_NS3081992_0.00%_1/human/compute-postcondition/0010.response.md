Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits, `l` is an integer representing the length of `b`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the binary value of `k`, `ans` is a list containing 1 and 2, `lk` is an integer representing the length of `bk` and `lk` is at least 3, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include 2, which is the result of 2 raised to the power of `i` (2^1). The other variables remain unchanged.
