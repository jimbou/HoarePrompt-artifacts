Functionality: This function generates a sequence of powers of 2 based on the input integers n and k, where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it returns a string of space-separated powers of 2, starting from 2^lk to 2^(l - 1), where lk is the length of the binary representation of k and is at least 21, and l is the length of the binary string b. The function takes no arguments and returns a string.
