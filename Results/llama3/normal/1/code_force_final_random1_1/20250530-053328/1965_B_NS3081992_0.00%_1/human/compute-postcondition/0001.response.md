Output State: **`func_10()` returns a non-negative integer greater than 0, `func_14()` returns a non-negative integer, and the output of `func_14()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character.**

In this output state, the values of `func_10()` and `func_14()` remain unchanged, as they are functions that return values and are not modified by the code. The code only prints the output of `func_14()` to the console, followed by a newline character, using `sys.stdout.write()`. This does not affect the values of `func_10()` or `func_14()`, but rather produces output to the console.
