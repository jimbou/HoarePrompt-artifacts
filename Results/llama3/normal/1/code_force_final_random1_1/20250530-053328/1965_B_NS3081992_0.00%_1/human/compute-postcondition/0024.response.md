Postcondition: ***n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, b is a string of binary digits, l is an integer representing the length of b. If k is equal to 1, n is not equal to 2. If k is not equal to 1, the list `ans` contains all the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l - 1), where lk is the length of the binary representation of k and is at least 21, and the variable `i` is equal to `l`.***
