To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(lk - 1):`. The only object in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `lk - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `lk` is at least 3.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `lk` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits, `l` is an integer representing the length of `b`, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the binary value of `k`, `ans` is a list containing 1 and 2, `lk` is an integer representing the length of `bk` and `lk` is at least 3, `i` is 2**
