Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is a list containing the value of missing, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, a is a non-empty string, freq is a list of 7 integers where each index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in the string a is incremented by the frequency of that character in the string a, and the frequency of all characters in the string a is incremented by the number of times each character appears in the string a, prob is the last character in the string a, missing is the sum of the maximum of 0 and m minus f for each f in freq.**

The code calculates the value of `missing` by summing the maximum of 0 and `m` minus each frequency `f` in the list `freq`. This value is then appended to the list `results`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
