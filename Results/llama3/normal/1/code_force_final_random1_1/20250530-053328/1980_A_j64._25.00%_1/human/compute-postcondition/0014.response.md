Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of missing, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a non-empty string, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in the string `a` is incremented by the frequency of that character in the string `a`, and the frequency of the first character in the string `a` is incremented by 1, `prob` is the first character in the string `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `freq` has been updated to reflect the increased frequency of the first character in the string `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
