Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `missing`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a non-empty string, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at the index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 1 and the rest are 0, `prob` is the first character in the string `a`, `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and `m` minus `f` for each `f` in `freq`**

In this output state, the value of `freq` has been updated to reflect the increment of the frequency of the character `prob` in the string `a`. The index of the incremented frequency is determined by the ASCII value of `prob` minus the ASCII value of 'A'. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
