Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to hold m rounds, given a bank of n problems with difficulty levels 'A' to 'G'.

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases` as input.

3. Inside the function, it iterates over each test case, extracts the number of problems in the bank `n`, the number of upcoming rounds `m`, and the string of problem difficulties `a`.

4. It then initializes a frequency list `freq` of size 7 (one for each difficulty level) and counts the occurrence of each difficulty level in the string `a`.

5. The program calculates the total number of missing problems by summing up the maximum of 0 and `m - f` for each frequency `f` in `freq`. This effectively calculates the number of problems needed to reach `m` for each difficulty level.

6. The result is appended to the `results` list, which is returned at the end of the function.

7. The program then calls `func_1` with the predefined test cases and prints the results.

Based on the provided problem description and the given Python program, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to hold m rounds.

Correctness: **True**
