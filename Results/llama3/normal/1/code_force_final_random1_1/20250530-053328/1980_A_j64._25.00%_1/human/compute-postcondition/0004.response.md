Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 1 character, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the index corresponding to the ASCII value of `prob` (the first character in the string `a`) is incremented by 1, `prob` is the first character in the string `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `freq` has been updated to reflect the frequency of the first character in the string `a`. The index in `freq` corresponding to the ASCII value of `prob` (the first character in the string `a`) has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
