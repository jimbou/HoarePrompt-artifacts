Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 2, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is a list containing the value of missing, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, a is a non-empty string, freq is a list of 7 zeros, prob is the last character in the string a, missing is the sum of the maximum of 0 and m minus f for each f in freq
Code of the loop:
for prob in a:
    freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `missing`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a non-empty string, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at the index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 1 and the rest are 0, `prob` is the first character in the string `a`, `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and `m` minus `f` for each `f` in `freq`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `missing`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at the index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 2 and the rest are 0, `prob` is the second character in the string `a`, `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and `m` minus `f` for each `f` in `freq`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `missing`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the integer at the index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is 3 and the rest are 0, `prob` is the third character in the string `a`, `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and `m` minus `f` for each `f` in `freq`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
