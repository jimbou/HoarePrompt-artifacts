The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is a list containing the value of missing, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, a is an empty string, freq is a list of 7 integers where each index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in the string a is incremented by the frequency of that character in the string a, prob is the last character in the string a.**
