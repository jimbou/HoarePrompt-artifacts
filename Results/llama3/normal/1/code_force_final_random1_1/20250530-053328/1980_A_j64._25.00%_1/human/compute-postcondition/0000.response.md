Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G', results is an empty list.**

The code snippet provided is a docstring and a list initialization. The docstring does not affect the state of the variables, and the list initialization creates an empty list called `results`. The initial state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
