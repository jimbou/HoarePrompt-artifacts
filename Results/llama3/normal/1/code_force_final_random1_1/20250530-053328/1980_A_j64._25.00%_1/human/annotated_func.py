#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. It accepts a positive integer 't' representing the number of test cases and a list 'test_cases' containing tuples of three elements: 'n' (number of problems in the bank), 'm' (number of upcoming rounds), and 'a' (a string of problem difficulties). The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for the corresponding test case. The function iterates over each test case, calculates the frequency of each problem difficulty, and then determines the minimum number of problems needed to meet the requirement of 'm' problems for each difficulty. The final state of the program is a list of these calculated minimum numbers, one for each test case.
