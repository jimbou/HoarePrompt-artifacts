Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G', results is an empty list, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, a is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G', freq is a list of 7 zeros
Code of the loop:
for prob in a:
    freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 1 character, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the index corresponding to the ASCII value of `prob` (the first character in the string `a`) is incremented by 1, `prob` is the first character in the string `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 2 characters, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the index corresponding to the ASCII value of `prob` (the second character in the string `a`) is incremented by 1, `prob` is the second character in the string `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G' that must have at least 3 characters, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where the index corresponding to the ASCII value of `prob` (the third character in the string `a`) is incremented by 1, `prob` is the third character in the string `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
