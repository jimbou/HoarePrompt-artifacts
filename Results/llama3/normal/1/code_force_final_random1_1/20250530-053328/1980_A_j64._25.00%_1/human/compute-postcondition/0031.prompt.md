Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G', results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, a = test_cases[_]
    freq = [0] * 7
    for prob in a:
        freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1
    missing = sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)
    results.append(missing)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is a list containing the value of missing, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, a is an empty string, freq is a list of 7 integers where each index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in the string a is incremented by the frequency of that character in the string a, prob is the last character in the string a.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is a list containing the value of missing, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, a is a non-empty string, freq is a list of 7 integers where each index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in the string a is incremented by the frequency of that character in the string a, and the frequency of all characters in the string a is incremented by the number of times each character appears in the string a, prob is the last character in the string a, missing is the sum of the maximum of 0 and m minus f for each f in freq.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 2, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is a list containing the value of missing, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, a is a non-empty string, freq is a list of 7 integers where the integer at the index ord(prob) - ord('A') is equal to the number of times the character prob appears in the string a, prob is the last character in the string a, missing is the sum of the maximum of 0 and m minus f for each f in freq




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
