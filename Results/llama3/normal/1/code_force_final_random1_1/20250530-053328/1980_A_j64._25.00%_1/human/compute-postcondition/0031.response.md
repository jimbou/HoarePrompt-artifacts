Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is t-1, test_cases is an empty list, results is a list containing the value of missing for each test case, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, a is an empty string, freq is a list of 7 integers where each index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in the string a is incremented by the frequency of that character in the string a, prob is the last character in the string a, missing is the sum of the maximum of 0 and m minus f for each f in freq.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The loop counter `_` has reached `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The `test_cases` list is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The `results` list contains the value of `missing` for each test case. The other variables, `n`, `m`, `a`, `freq`, `prob`, and `missing`, have reached their final values after processing all test cases.
