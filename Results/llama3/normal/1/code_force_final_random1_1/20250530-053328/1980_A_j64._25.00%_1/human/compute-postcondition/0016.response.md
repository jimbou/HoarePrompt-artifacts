Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of missing, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, `a` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `freq` is a list of 7 integers where each index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in the string `a` is incremented by the frequency of that character in the string `a`, and the frequency of the next character in the string `a` is incremented by 2, `prob` is the next character in the string `a`.**

In this output state, the frequency of the next character in the string `a` is incremented by 1, as indicated by the code `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
