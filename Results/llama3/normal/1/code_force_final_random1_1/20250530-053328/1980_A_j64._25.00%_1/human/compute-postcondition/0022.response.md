Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 2, test_cases is a list of tuples, results is a list containing the value of missing, n is an integer between 1 and 50, m is an integer between 1 and 5, a is a non-empty string, freq is a list of 7 zeros, prob is the last character in the string a, missing is the sum of the maximum of 0 and m minus f for each f in freq**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `prob`, and `missing` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is that `freq` is now a list of 7 zeros, replacing its previous value which was a list of 7 integers where each index corresponding to the ASCII value of each character in the string `a` was incremented by the frequency of that character in the string `a`.
