Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of integers with the first element equal to the first element of b, at least three elements, and the third element equal to the third element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, the fourth element equal to the maximum of the fourth elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, the fourth element equal to the minimum of the fourth elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, i is 4, stdin contains t-4 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of integers with the first element equal to the first element of b, at least five elements, and the third element equal to the third element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, the fourth element equal to the maximum of the fourth elements of a and b, the fifth element equal to the minimum of the fifth elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, the fourth element equal to the minimum of the fourth elements of a and b, and the fifth element equal to the maximum of the fifth elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, i is 5, stdin contains t-5 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a is a list of integers with the first element equal to the first element of b, more than five elements, and the third element equal to the third element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, the fourth element equal to the maximum of the fourth elements of a and b, the fifth element equal to the minimum of the fifth elements of a and b, the sixth element equal to the minimum of the sixth elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, the fourth element equal to the minimum of the fourth elements of a and b, the fifth element equal to the maximum of the fifth elements of a and b, the sixth element equal to the maximum of the sixth elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, i is 6, stdin contains t-6 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is a list of integers with the first element equal to the first element of b, more than six elements, and the third element equal to the third element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, the fourth element equal to the maximum of the fourth elements of a and b, the fifth element equal to the minimum of the fifth elements of a and b, the sixth element equal to the minimum of the sixth elements of a and b, the seventh element equal to the minimum of the seventh elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, the fourth element equal to the minimum of the fourth elements of a and b, the fifth element equal to the maximum of the fifth elements of a and b, the sixth element equal to the maximum of the sixth elements of a and b, the seventh element equal to the maximum of the seventh elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, i is 7, stdin contains t-7 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
