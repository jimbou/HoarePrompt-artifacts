Output State: **a is a list of integers with the first element equal to the first element of b, at least three elements, and the third element equal to the third element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, i is 3, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.**

In this output state, the first and third elements of `a` and `b` are equal, and `new` and `new2` have their first three elements set to the maximum and minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`, respectively. The rest of the elements in `new` and `new2` are None. The value of `i` has been incremented to 3, and stdin now contains t-3 pairs of integers.
