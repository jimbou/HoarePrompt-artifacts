Output State: **a is a list of integers with the first element equal to the first element of b, at least t-3 elements, and the third element equal to the third element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, the fourth element equal to the maximum of the fourth elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, the fourth element equal to the minimum of the fourth elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is t, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The list `a` has at least `t-3` elements, with the first element equal to the first element of `b`, and the third element equal to the third element of `b`.
* The list `b` remains unchanged.
* The list `new` has the first four elements equal to the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and the rest of the elements equal to the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`.
* The list `new2` has the first four elements equal to the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and the rest of the elements equal to the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`.
* The variable `i` is equal to `t`.
* The standard input `stdin` is empty, containing no pairs of integers `x` and `y`.
