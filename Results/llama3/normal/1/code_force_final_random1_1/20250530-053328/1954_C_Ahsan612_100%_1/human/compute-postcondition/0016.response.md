Output State: **a is a list of integers with the first element equal to the first element of b, more than six elements, and the third element equal to the third element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, the fourth element equal to the maximum of the fourth elements of a and b, the fifth element equal to the minimum of the fifth elements of a and b, the sixth element equal to the minimum of the sixth elements of a and b, the seventh element equal to the minimum of the seventh elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, the fourth element equal to the minimum of the fourth elements of a and b, the fifth element equal to the maximum of the fifth elements of a and b, the sixth element equal to the maximum of the sixth elements of a and b, the seventh element equal to the maximum of the seventh elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, i is 7, stdin contains t-7 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.**

The code modifies the lists `new` and `new2` by assigning the minimum and maximum values of the seventh elements of `a` and `b` to the seventh elements of `new` and `new2`, respectively. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the number of pairs of integers in stdin is reduced by 1.
