Output State: **a is a list of integers with the first element equal to the first element of b and at least two elements, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, and the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, and the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, i is 2, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.**

In this output state, the first and second elements of new and new2 have been updated based on the maximum and minimum values of the corresponding elements in a and b, respectively. The value of i has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
