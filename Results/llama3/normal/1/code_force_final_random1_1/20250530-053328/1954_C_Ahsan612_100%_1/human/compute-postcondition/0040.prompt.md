Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of integers with the first element equal to the first element of b, at least t elements, the third element equal to the third element of b, the fourth element equal to the fourth element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is t, t is greater than the current length of a, i is less than t, stdin contains 1 pair of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, and this is printed: a string of digits representing the elements of the new2 list, where the first three elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new[i] is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], new2[i] is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], and i is incremented by 1, and the current value of i is not equal to the length of a.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of integers with at least t+1 elements, the first element equal to the first element of b, the third element equal to the third element of b, the fourth element equal to the fourth element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is t, t is greater than the current length of a, i is less than t, stdin contains 1 pair of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, and this is printed: a string of digits representing the elements of the new2 list, where the first three elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new[i] is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], new2[i] is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], and i is incremented by 1, and the current value of i is equal to the length of a.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a is a list of integers with at least t+2 elements, the first element equal to the first element of b, the third element equal to the third element of b, the fourth element equal to the fourth element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is less than the length of a and is one more than its original value, t is greater than the current length of a, stdin contains 1 pair of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, and this is printed: a string of digits representing the elements of the new2 list, where the first three elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new[i-1] is the minimum of a[i-1] and b[i-1], new2[i-1] is the maximum of a[i-1] and b[i-1]
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is a list of integers with at least i+1 elements, the first element equal to the first element of b, the third element equal to the third element of b, the fourth element equal to the fourth element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is less than the length of a and is two more than its original value, t is greater than the current length of a, stdin is empty, and the string of digits representing the elements of the new2 list, where the first three elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, has been printed, new[i-1] is the minimum of a[i-1] and b[i-1], new2[i-1] is the maximum of a[i] and b[i], and new[i] is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], new2[i] is the maximum of a[i] and b[i].


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
