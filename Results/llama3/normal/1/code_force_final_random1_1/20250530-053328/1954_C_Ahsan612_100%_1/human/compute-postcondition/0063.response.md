Output State: **a is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, the first element equal to the first element of b, the second element equal to the second element of b, the third element equal to the third element of b, the fourth element equal to the fourth element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the (i-1)th element which is now equal to the minimum of the (i-1)th elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the (i-1)th element which is now equal to the maximum of the (i-1)th elements of a and b, i is equal to its original value plus 4, t is greater than the current length of a, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, and this is printed: a string of digits representing the elements of the new2 list, where the first three elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, the input to the range function is greater than 1, the length of a must be greater than the original value of i plus 4, and i currently must be less than len(a)**
