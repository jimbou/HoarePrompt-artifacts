The `print` statement will print a string representation of the `new` list. The `new` list is constructed by taking the maximum of the corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for the first three elements, and the minimum of the corresponding elements for the rest of the elements, unless `i` is equal to the length of `a`, in which case the rest of the elements are `None`.

Since `a` and `b` are lists of integers, the elements of `new` will be integers. The `join` function is used to concatenate the string representations of these integers into a single string.

Therefore, the output will be a string of digits, where each digit is an integer from the `new` list.

Output: **a string of digits representing the elements of the new list**
