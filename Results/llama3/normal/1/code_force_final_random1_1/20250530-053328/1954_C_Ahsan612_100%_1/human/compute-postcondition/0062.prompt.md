You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for modifying the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the `while` loop statement. If it is a `while True` loop or if the loop can certainly execute one more time, please simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10,  `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3.
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The variables in the loop head are i and n, so we can only adjust them.. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3. `n` being greater than 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4,  `n` must be greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0,  students is 3 less than its initial value.
```
while students >=1 :
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variable in the loop head is variable students, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable students.  If students is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, students is 3 less than its initial value, So for the loop to be executed one more time the initial value of students needed to have been equal or greater than 4 and students currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`total` is 0, students is 3 less than its initial value and students currently must be greater or equal to 1**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: a is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, the first element equal to the first element of b, the second element equal to the second element of b, the third element equal to the third element of b, the fourth element equal to the fourth element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the i-th element which is now equal to the minimum of the i-th elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the i-th element which is now equal to the maximum of the i-th elements of a and b, i is equal to its original value plus 3, t is greater than the current length of a, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, and this is printed: a string of digits representing the elements of the new2 list, where the first three elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, the input to the range function is greater than 1, the length of a must be greater than the original value of i plus 3, and i currently must be less than len(a)
```
while i < len(a):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
