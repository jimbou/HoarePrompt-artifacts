To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is an integer `t` in the input that is within the range of 1 to 1000. This integer `t` determines the number of iterations of the loop.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, `_` is 0**
