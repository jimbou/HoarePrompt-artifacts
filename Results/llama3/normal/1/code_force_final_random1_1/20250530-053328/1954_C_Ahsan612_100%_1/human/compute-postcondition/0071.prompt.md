Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, list(input())))
    b = list(map(int, list(input())))
    new = [None] * len(a)
    new2 = [None] * len(a)
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
    if i != len(a):
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
        while i < len(a):
            new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of integers with the first element equal to the first element of b, at least t-3 elements, and the third element equal to the third element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b if i is not equal to the length of a, otherwise the rest of the elements are None, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b if i is not equal to the length of a, otherwise the rest of the elements are None, i is t if i is not equal to the length of a, otherwise i is 3, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length if i is not equal to the length of a, otherwise stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, and this is printed: a string of digits representing the elements of the new2 list, where the first three elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b if i is not equal to the length of a, otherwise the rest of the elements are None

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is a list of integers with at least t elements, the first element equal to the first element of b, the third element equal to the third element of b, the fourth element equal to the fourth element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, if i is not equal to the length of a, then i is equal to t, t is greater than the current length of a, stdin contains 1 pair of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, and this is printed: a string of digits representing the elements of the new2 list, where the first three elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2[i] is the minimum of a[i] and b[i], and i is incremented by 1. If i is equal to the length of a, then i is equal to the length of a, t is greater than the current length of a, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, and this is printed: a string of digits representing the elements of the new2 list, where the first three elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is a list of integers with at least t elements, the first element equal to the first element of b, the second element equal to the second element of b, the third element equal to the third element of b, the fourth element equal to the fourth element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the elements from index 0 to i-1 which are now equal to the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b if i is not equal to the length of a, otherwise the rest of the elements are equal to the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements equal to the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the elements from index 0 to i-1 which are now equal to the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b if i is not equal to the length of a, otherwise the rest of the elements are equal to the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to the length of a, t is greater than the current length of a, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length, and this is printed: a string of digits representing the elements of the new2 list, where the first three elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
