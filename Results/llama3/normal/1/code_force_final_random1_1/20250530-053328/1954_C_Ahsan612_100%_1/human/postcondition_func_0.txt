This function reads pairs of integers from standard input, where each pair represents two strings of digits with the same length. It then generates two new strings by comparing the corresponding digits of the input strings. The first new string has the maximum digit at the first differing position and the minimum digits at all other positions, while the second new string has the minimum digit at the first differing position and the maximum digits at all other positions. The function prints these two new strings for each pair of input strings.
