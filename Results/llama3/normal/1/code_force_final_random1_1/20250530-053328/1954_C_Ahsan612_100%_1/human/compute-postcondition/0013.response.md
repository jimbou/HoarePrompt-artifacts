The only variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and a.  If i is less than the length of a, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 5 and a has at least five elements, So for the loop to be executed one more time a must have more than 5 elements.
State: **a is a list of integers with the first element equal to the first element of b, more than five elements, and the third element equal to the third element of b, b is a list of integers, new is a list of integers with the first element equal to the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the maximum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the maximum of the third elements of a and b, the fourth element equal to the maximum of the fourth elements of a and b, the fifth element equal to the minimum of the fifth elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, new2 is a list of integers with the first element equal to the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element equal to the minimum of the second elements of a and b, the third element equal to the minimum of the third elements of a and b, the fourth element equal to the minimum of the fourth elements of a and b, and the fifth element equal to the maximum of the fifth elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements are None, i is 5, stdin contains t-5 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.**
