The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains `a` pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**
