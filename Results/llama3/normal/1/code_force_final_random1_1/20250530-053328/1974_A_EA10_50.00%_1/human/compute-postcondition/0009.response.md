Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, i is 1, stdin contains a-3 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), x is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), y is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), z is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between -390 and 0 (inclusive).**

The code executes as follows:

1. The first line reads a pair of integers from stdin and assigns them to x and y, respectively. This reduces the number of pairs in stdin by 1.

2. The second line calculates the value of z as (y + 1) // 2, which is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive).

3. The third line calculates the value of m as 15 * z - y * 4, which is an integer between -390 and 0 (inclusive).

The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, and updates the values of x, y, z, and m as calculated above.
