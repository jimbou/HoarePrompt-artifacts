Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains a-2 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), `x` is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `y` is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `z` is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive) and is equal to its previous value plus ((x - m + 14) // 15), `m` is an integer between -390 and 0 (inclusive) and the current value of `m` is less than the current value of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(x - m + 14) // 15` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less pair of integers, as one pair has been read and used to update the value of `z`.
