Output: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains a-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), x is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), y is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), z is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between -390 and 0 (inclusive). If m is less than a, stdin contains a-2 pairs of integers x and y, z is equal to its previous value plus ((x - m + 14) // 15), and m is less than a, and the value of z which is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive) is being printed**
