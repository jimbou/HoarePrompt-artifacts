Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `y` is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `m` is an integer, `z` is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive) plus the integer division of (`x` - `m` + 14) by 15, stdin contains a-6 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding the integer division of (`x` - `m` + 14) by 15 to its previous value. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains a-6 pairs of integers x and y, as one pair has been read and processed.
