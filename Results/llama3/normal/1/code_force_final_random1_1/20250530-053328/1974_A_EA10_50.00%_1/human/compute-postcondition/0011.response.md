Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `y` is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), if `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive) and is equal to `z + (x - m + 14) // 15`, and stdin contains a-4 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
