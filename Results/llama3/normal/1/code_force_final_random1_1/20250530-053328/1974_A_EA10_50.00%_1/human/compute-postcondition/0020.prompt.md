Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `a` pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    z = (y + 1) // 2
    m = 15 * z - y * 4
    if m < a:
        z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
    print(z)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains a-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), x is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), y is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), z is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between -390 and 0 (inclusive). If m is less than a, stdin contains a-2 pairs of integers x and y, z is equal to its previous value plus ((x - m + 14) // 15), and m is less than a, and the value of z which is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `y` is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), if `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive) and is equal to `z + (x - m + 14) // 15`, and stdin contains a-4 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the value of `z` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `y` is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `m` is an integer, `z` is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive) plus the integer division of (`x` - `m` + 14) by 15 if `m` is less than `a`, otherwise `z` remains unchanged, stdin contains a-5 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), and the value of `z` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
