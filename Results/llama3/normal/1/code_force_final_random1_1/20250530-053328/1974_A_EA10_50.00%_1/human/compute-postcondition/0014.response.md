The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `y` is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), if `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive) and is equal to `z + (x - m + 14) // 15`, and stdin contains a-4 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the value of `z` is being printed.**
