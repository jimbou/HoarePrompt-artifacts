Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is (0, 1), the program outputs 1, but the correct output should be 1 because a 2x2 icon can fit in a single screen. However, when the input is (0, 2), the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be 1 because two 2x2 icons can fit in a single screen.

The issue with the program is that it calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons separately and then adds the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons. However, this approach does not consider the case where the 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space of the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons.

To fix this issue, the program should calculate the total number of cells needed for all icons and then divide it by the total number of cells in a screen (15) to get the minimum number of screens needed.
