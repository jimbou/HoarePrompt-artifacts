Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `y` is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), `z` is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive) and is equal to `z + (x - m + 14) // 15`, `m` is an integer between -390 and 0 (inclusive), stdin contains a-4 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` remains unchanged, `i` remains 1, `x` and `y` are still integers between 0 and 99, `m` is still an integer between -390 and 0, and `z` is updated to be the sum of its original value and the result of the expression `(x - m + 14) // 15`. The stdin now contains one less pair of integers.
