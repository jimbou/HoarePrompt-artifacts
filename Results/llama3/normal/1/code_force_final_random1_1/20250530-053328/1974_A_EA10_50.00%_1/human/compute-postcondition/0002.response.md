Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains a-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), x is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), y is an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive), z is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive), m is an integer between -390 and 0 (inclusive)**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains 0 as it is not modified. Stdin initially contains `a` pairs of integers, but after the first line of code executes, one pair is consumed, leaving `a-1` pairs. The values of `x` and `y` are assigned from the first pair of integers in stdin, so they can be any integers between 0 and 99 (inclusive). The value of `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`, which means it can be any integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive), since `y` is between 0 and 99. Finally, the value of `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`, which can result in any integer between -390 and 0 (inclusive), given the possible ranges of `z` and `y`.
