Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer minus one and must be greater than 1, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, f is a positive integer and equals to `f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n-1]), b)`, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, ls is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer minus one and must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 1, `f` is a positive integer and equals to `f - min(a * (ls[1] - ls[0]), b)`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `ls` is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer minus one and must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2, `f` is a positive integer and equals to `f - min(a * (ls[2] - ls[1]), b)`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `ls` is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer minus one and must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `f` is a positive integer and equals to `f - min(a * (ls[3] - ls[2]), b)`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `ls` is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
