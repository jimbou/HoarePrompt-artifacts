Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1} for 1 <= i < n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` has been assigned a positive integer value from the input, and the rest of the input remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases with their respective values for `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `m_i`.
