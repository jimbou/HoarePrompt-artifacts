Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, ls is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code reads two lines from stdin for a test case. The first line assigns the values of four space-separated integers to n, f, a, and b. The second line assigns a list of n+1 positive integers to ls, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order. The value of t remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by one after the execution of the code.
