Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of four integers (n, f, a, and b) and a list of n integers (m_1, m_2, ..., m_n) in ascending order. 

It then calculates the remaining value of f after subtracting the minimum of a times the difference between each consecutive pair of integers in the list and b. This is done to simulate the phone's charge consumption, where a is the charge consumption per unit of time and b is the charge consumption when the phone is turned off and on sequentially. 

If the remaining value of f is greater than 0, it prints 'YES', indicating that Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone. Otherwise, it prints 'NO', indicating that Stepan cannot send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone. 

The program repeats this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.

Correctness: **True**
