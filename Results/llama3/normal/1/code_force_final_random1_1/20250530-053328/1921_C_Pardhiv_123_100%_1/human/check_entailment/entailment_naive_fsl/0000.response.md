Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone. It iterates through the list of message sending moments, calculates the minimum charge consumption between each moment (either by keeping the phone on or turning it off and on), and subtracts this consumption from the initial phone charge. If the remaining charge is greater than 0 after all messages have been sent, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where the phone's initial charge is 0 or the charge consumption per unit of time is 0. It also handles the case where the number of messages is 1, where the phone's charge is only consumed by the action of turning off and on.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
