To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, it remains the same.

The other variables `t`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `ls` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `f` is a positive integer and equals to `f - min(a * (ls[2] - ls[1]), b)`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `ls` is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3**
