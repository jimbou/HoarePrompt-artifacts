Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1} for 1 <= i < n.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
    ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
    if f > 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer minus one, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `f` is a positive integer and equals to `f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n-1]), b)`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `ls` is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n`. If the current value of `f` is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer minus two and must be greater than 0, n is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, f is a positive integer and equals to f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n-1]), b), a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, ls is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is a positive integer minus three and must be greater than 0, n is a positive integer and equals to the value of the first input and must be greater than or equal to 1, f is a positive integer and equals to the value of the second input minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between each element of ls and the previous element of ls and b, a is a positive integer and equals to the value of the third input, b is a positive integer and equals to the value of the fourth input, ls is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order and equals to the list of the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is n. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if f is less than or equal to 0, 'NO' is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
