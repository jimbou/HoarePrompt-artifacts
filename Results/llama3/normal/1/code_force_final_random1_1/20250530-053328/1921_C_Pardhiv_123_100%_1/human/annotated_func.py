#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1} for 1 <= i < n.
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is 0, n is a positive integer and equals to the value of the first input and must be greater than or equal to 1, f is a positive integer and equals to the value of the second input minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between each element of ls and the previous element of ls and b, a is a positive integer and equals to the value of the third input, b is a positive integer and equals to the value of the fourth input, ls is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order and equals to the list of the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of test cases, i is n. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if f is less than or equal to 0, 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains four integers (n, f, a, and b), and the second line contains n integers (m_1, m_2, ..., m_n) in ascending order. The function calculates the remaining value of f after subtracting the minimum of a times the difference between each consecutive pair of integers in the second line and b. If the remaining value of f is greater than 0, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
