Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `f` is a positive integer that is decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[1] - ls[0])` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `ls` is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[1] - ls[0])` and `b` from its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `ls[1] - ls[0]` is a positive integer since `ls` is a list of positive integers in ascending order and `ls[0]` is 0.
