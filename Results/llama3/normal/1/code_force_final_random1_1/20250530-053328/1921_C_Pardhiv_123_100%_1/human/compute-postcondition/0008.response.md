Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `f` is a positive integer and equals to `f - min(a * (ls[3] - ls[2]), b)`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `ls` is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated to `f - min(a * (ls[3] - ls[2]), b)`, which means it has been decreased by the minimum of `a` times the difference between the third and second elements of `ls` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
