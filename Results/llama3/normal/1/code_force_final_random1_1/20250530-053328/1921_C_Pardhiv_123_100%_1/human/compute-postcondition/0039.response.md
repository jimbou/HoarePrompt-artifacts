The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`+1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer minus two and must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the first input and must be greater than 1, `f` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the second input minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second element of `ls` and the first element of `ls` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the third input, `b` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the fourth input, `ls` is a list of `n`+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order and equals to the list of the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2**
