Output State: `t` is a positive integer minus two and must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the first input and must be greater than 0, `f` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the second input minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `n`+1th element of `ls` and the `n`th element of `ls` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the third input, `b` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the fourth input, `ls` is a list of `n`+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order and equals to the list of the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `f` has been updated to be the value of the second input minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the last two elements of `ls` and `b`, and the value of `i` has been updated to be equal to `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ls`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
