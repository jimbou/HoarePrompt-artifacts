Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus one and must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `f` is a positive integer and equals to `f - min(a * (ls[3] - ls[2]), b)`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `ls` is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 3**

The value of `f` is updated by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[3] - ls[2])` and `b` from its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
