The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer minus one and must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3, `f` is a positive integer and equals to `f - min(a * (ls[2] - ls[1]), b)`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `ls` is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 3**
