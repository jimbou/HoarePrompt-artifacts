The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer minus one, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer minus one and must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `f` is a positive integer and equals to `f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n-1]), b)`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `ls` is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n`.**
