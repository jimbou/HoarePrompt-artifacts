Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus two and must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the first input and must be greater than 0, `f` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the second input minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second element of `ls` and the first element of `ls` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the third input, `b` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the fourth input, `ls` is a list of `n`+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order and equals to the list of the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second element of `ls` and the first element of `ls` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `f` is now dependent on the values of `a`, `b`, and the elements of `ls`.
