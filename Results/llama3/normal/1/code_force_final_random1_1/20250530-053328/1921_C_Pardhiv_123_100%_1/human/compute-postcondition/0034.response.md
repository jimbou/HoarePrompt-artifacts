Output State: **t is a positive integer minus two and must be greater than 0, n is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, f is a positive integer and equals to f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n-1]), b), a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, ls is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t has decreased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for the variables also remain the same, with t being a positive integer minus two and greater than 0, n being a positive integer greater than 0, f being a positive integer equal to f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n-1]), b), a and b being positive integers, ls being a list of n+1 positive integers in ascending order, and stdin containing multiple test cases minus two. The value of i is still n. Additionally, the condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of f remains the same.
