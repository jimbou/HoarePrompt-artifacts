Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, f is a positive integer and equals to f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n-1]), b), a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, ls is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `f` will be decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[n] - ls[n-1])` and `b`, where `n` is the number of iterations. The other variables remain unchanged. The loop has iterated `n` times, and the value of `i` is now equal to `n`.
