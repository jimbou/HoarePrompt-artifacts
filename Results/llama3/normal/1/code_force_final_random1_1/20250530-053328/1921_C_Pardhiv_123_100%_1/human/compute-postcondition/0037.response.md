The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n` does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 1. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer minus two and must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the first input and must be greater than 0, `f` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the second input, `a` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the third input, `b` is a positive integer and equals to the value of the fourth input, `ls` is a list of `n`+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order and equals to the list of the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1**
