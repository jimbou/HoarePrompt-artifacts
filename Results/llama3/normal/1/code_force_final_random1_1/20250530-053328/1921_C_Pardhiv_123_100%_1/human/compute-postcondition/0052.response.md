Output State: **t is a positive integer minus three and must be greater than 0, n is a positive integer and equals to the value of the first input and must be greater than or equal to 1, f is a positive integer and equals to the value of the second input minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between each element of ls and the previous element of ls and b, a is a positive integer and equals to the value of the third input, b is a positive integer and equals to the value of the fourth input, ls is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order and equals to the list of the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is n. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if f is less than or equal to 0, 'NO' is printed.**

The code decrements the value of t by 1. The initial state of t was a positive integer minus two and must be greater than 1, so after decrementing, t becomes a positive integer minus three and must be greater than 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two, but since we have decremented t, we have processed one more test case, so stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three.
