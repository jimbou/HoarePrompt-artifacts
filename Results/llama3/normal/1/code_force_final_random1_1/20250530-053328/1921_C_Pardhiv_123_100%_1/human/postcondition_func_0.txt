This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains four integers (n, f, a, and b), and the second line contains n integers (m_1, m_2, ..., m_n) in ascending order. The function calculates the remaining value of f after subtracting the minimum of a times the difference between each consecutive pair of integers in the second line and b. If the remaining value of f is greater than 0, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
