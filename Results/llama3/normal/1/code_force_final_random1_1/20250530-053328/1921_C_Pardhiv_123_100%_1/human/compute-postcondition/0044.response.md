Output State: **t is a positive integer minus two and must be greater than 1, n is a positive integer and equals to the value of the first input and must be greater than or equal to 1, f is a positive integer and equals to the value of the second input minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between each element of ls and the previous element of ls and b, a is a positive integer and equals to the value of the third input, b is a positive integer and equals to the value of the fourth input, ls is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order and equals to the list of the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still equal to the first input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is updated to be the second input minus the sum of the minimum of `a` times the difference between each element of `ls` and the previous element of `ls` and `b`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `ls` remains the same, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, and `i` is now equal to `n`.
