Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of messages `n`, the initial phone charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially `b`.
3.  It then reads the list of message sending moments `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` and stores them in the list `ls` with an additional element `0` at the beginning to simplify the calculation of differences between consecutive moments.
4.  The program calculates the remaining charge `f` after sending all messages by iterating over the list `ls`. For each message, it subtracts the minimum of the charge consumed by keeping the phone on (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`) and the charge consumed by turning the phone off and on (`b`) from the remaining charge `f`.
5.  Finally, the program checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than `0`. If it is, it prints "YES", indicating that Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the given Python program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
