To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is initialized to `n`, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 1 and `i` to be 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer minus one and must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 1, `f` is a positive integer and equals to `f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n-1]), b)`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `ls` is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1**
