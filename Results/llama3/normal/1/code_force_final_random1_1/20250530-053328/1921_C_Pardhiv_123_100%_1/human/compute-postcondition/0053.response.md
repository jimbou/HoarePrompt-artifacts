Output State: **t is 0, n is a positive integer and equals to the value of the first input and must be greater than or equal to 1, f is a positive integer and equals to the value of the second input minus the sum of the minimum of a times the difference between each element of ls and the previous element of ls and b, a is a positive integer and equals to the value of the third input, b is a positive integer and equals to the value of the fourth input, ls is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order and equals to the list of the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the number of test cases, i is n. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if f is less than or equal to 0, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing all the test cases. The value of t is now 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The values of n, f, a, b, and ls are the same as the last test case. The value of f has been updated to reflect the result of the last test case. If f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed. The stdin contains no more test cases.
