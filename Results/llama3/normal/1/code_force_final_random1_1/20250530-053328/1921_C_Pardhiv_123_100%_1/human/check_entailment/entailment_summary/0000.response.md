Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input values for each test case, including the number of messages `n`, the initial phone charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially `b`.
2.  It also correctly reads the moments at which messages need to be sent, stored in the list `ls`.
3.  The program then iterates through each message moment, calculating the minimum charge consumption between keeping the phone on (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`) and turning it off and on (`b`). This minimum charge consumption is subtracted from the remaining phone charge `f`.
4.  After processing all message moments, the program checks if the remaining phone charge `f` is greater than 0. If it is, the program prints 'YES', indicating that Stepan can send all messages without the possibility of charging the phone. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
