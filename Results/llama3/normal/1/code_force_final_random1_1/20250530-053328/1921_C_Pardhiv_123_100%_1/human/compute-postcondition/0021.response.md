Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus one and must be greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 1, `f` is a positive integer and equals to `f - min(a * (ls[1] - ls[0]), b)`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `ls` is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains a positive integer minus one and greater than 1, `n` remains a positive integer and at least 1, `f` is updated to be a positive integer and equals to `f - min(a * (ls[1] - ls[0]), b)`, `a` and `b` remain positive integers, `ls` remains a list of `n+1` positive integers in ascending order, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus two, and `i` remains 1.
