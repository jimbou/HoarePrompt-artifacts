Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus one, `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `f` is a positive integer and equals to `f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n-1]), b)`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `ls` is a list of `n+1` positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `n`. If the current value of `f` is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `ls`, and `i` are still valid, and the stdin contains one less test case. The printing of 'YES' or 'NO' is still dependent on the value of `f`.
