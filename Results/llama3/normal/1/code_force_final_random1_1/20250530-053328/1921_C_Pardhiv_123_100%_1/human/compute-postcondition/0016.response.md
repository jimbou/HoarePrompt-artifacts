Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, f is a positive integer and equals to f - min(a * (ls[n] - ls[n-1]), b), a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, ls is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are in ascending order, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
