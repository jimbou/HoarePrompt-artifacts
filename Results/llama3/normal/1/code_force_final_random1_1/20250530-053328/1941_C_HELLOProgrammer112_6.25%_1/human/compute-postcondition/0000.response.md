To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. Since the loop iterates over the range of the integer input from `stdin`, we need to ensure that this input is at least 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, since `_` is the loop variable, its value will be the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case, _ is 0**
