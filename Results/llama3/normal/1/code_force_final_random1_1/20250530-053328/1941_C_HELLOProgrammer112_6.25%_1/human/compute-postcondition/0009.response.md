Output State: **a is an integer equal to the second input, s is a string equal to the third input, x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s, y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s, _ is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` have been updated based on the new inputs. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The number of test cases in `stdin` has been reduced by 2, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
