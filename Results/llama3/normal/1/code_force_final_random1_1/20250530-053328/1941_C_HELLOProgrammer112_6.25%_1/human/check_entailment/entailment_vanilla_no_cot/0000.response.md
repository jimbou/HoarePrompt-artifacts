Correctness: **False** 

The given program is incorrect because it simply counts the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string and prints their sum. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the case where 'map' and 'pie' overlap in the string. For example, in the string "mapie", the program would count it as 2 occurrences, but in reality, it should be counted as 1 because we can remove only 1 character to make the string beautiful.

To fix this, we need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as using a sliding window or dynamic programming, to correctly count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.
