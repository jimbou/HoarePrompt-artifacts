Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer 'n' and a string 's' of length 'n'. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string 's' and prints their sum. The function repeats this process for each test case until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is exhausted.**
