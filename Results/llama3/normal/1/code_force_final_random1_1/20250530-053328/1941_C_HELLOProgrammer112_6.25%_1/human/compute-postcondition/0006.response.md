Based on the precondition, the code `print(x + y)` will print the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the string `s`.
* `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the string `s`.
* The `print` statement adds the values of `x` and `y` together, which gives the total number of occurrences of both 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

Since the precondition states that the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in `s` is being printed, the output will be the total count of these occurrences.

Output: **the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string s**
