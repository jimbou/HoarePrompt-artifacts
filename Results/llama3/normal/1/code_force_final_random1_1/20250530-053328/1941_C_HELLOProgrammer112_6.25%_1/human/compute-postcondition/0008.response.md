The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `stdin`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `stdin` must contain at least 1 test case minus 1.
State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input, `s` is a string equal to the second input, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1, and the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in `s` is being printed, and the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in `s` which is equal to `x + y` is being printed**
