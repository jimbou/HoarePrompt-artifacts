Reasoning:
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It reads the input, counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie', and prints their sum, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. The problem statement mentions that the string can be shortened by removing characters from any positions, not just from the beginning or end of the string. The program's approach of simply counting the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' assumes that these substrings do not overlap. If they do overlap, the program will count some characters multiple times, leading to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the string "mapie". The program will count this as 2 occurrences (1 'map' and 1 'pie'), but in reality, only 1 character needs to be removed to make the string beautiful.

Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
