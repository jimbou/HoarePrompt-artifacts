Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in cases where the string contains overlapping substrings "map" and "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two separate substrings, but in reality, it should be counted as one substring "mapie" which is not a valid substring according to the problem description.

In this case, the program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1, because only one character needs to be removed to make the string beautiful.
