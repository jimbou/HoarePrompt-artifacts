Output State: **a is an integer, s is a string, x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s, y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 1**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `a`. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `s`. The third line assigns the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s` to `x`. The fourth line assigns the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s` to `y`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus 1, since two inputs have been read.
