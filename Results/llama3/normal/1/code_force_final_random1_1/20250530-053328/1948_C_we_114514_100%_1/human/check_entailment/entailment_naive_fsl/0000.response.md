Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting position (1, 1) based on the given grid and arrow directions.

The function `func_1` checks for two conditions that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell:

1. If there is a pair of arrows in the first row that would force the robot to move left and then encounter an arrow in the second row that also points left, effectively trapping the robot.
2. If the last arrow in the first row points left and the second-to-last arrow in the second row also points left, preventing the robot from reaching the target cell.

If neither of these conditions is met, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the robot can reach the target cell. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

The function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the provided grid dimensions and arrow directions.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
