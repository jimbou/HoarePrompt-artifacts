Postcondition: **The loop executes until `i` is equal to `half_n - 1`, at which point it terminates. If at any point during the loop's execution `row1[2 * i + 1]` is '<' and either `row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]` is '<', the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning a value. The current value of `row1[n - 1]` is '<' and the current value of `row2[n - 2]` is '<'.**
