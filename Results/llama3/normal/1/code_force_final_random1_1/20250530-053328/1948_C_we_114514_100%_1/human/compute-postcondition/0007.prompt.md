Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each input contains a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, n is an even positive integer, row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    row1 = input()
    row2 = input()
    results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, results is a list containing one element which is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2), n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, stdin contains t-4 inputs: each input contains a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, results is a list containing two elements, the first element is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2) before the code execution, the second element is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2) after the code execution, n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, stdin contains t-7 inputs: each input contains a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 1, results is a list containing three elements, the first element is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2) before the code execution, the second element is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2) after the code execution, the third element is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2) after the code execution, n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, stdin contains t-10 inputs: each input contains a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
