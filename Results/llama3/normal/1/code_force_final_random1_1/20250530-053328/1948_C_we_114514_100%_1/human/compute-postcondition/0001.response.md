According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each input contains a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, n is an even positive integer, row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters**
