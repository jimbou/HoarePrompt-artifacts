Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where a robot moves in a grid with two rows and n columns, and each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot starts at position (1,1) and can move left, right, up, or down, and then follows the arrow in the current cell. The program determines whether the robot can reach the cell (2,n).

Function 1 checks if the robot can reach the cell (2,n) by iterating through the grid and checking the arrows in the cells. If it finds a situation where the robot cannot move forward, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

Function 2 reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results. It calls Function 1 with the input values and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2,n) based on the given problem description. It handles all possible cases and returns the correct result.

Correctness: **True**
