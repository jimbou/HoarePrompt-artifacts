The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1, so `t` is at least 1. 
State: **`t` is at least 1, results is a list containing two elements, the first element is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2) before the code execution, the second element is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2) after the code execution, n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, stdin contains t-7 inputs: each input contains a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters**
