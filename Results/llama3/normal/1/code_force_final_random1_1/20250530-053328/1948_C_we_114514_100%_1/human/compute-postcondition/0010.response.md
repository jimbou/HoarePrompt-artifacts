Functionality: **This function reads input from the user, processes each test case, and prints the results. It accepts no parameters and returns nothing. The function reads a positive integer t, then for each test case, it reads an even positive integer n and two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. It calls the function func_1 with these inputs and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of func_1 for each test case. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed and the results have been printed to the console.**
