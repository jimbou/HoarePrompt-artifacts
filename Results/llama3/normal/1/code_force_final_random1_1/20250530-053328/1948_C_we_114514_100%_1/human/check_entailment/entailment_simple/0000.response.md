Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the number of columns `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` representing the arrows in the grid as input. It checks whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by iterating through the columns in steps of 2. If it finds a column where the arrow in `row1` points left and either the arrow in `row2` at the same column or the arrow in `row2` at the next column points left, it returns 'No'. If it reaches the last column and the arrow in `row1` points left and the arrow in `row2` at the previous column points left, it also returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

`func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results. It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the number of columns `n` and the two strings `row1` and `row2`. It calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to a list. Finally, it prints the results.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description. It checks all possible cases where the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) and returns 'No' accordingly. If none of these cases are met, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **True**
