Output State: **t is at least 2, results is a list containing two elements, the first element is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2) before the code execution, the second element is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2) after the code execution, n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, stdin contains t-7 inputs: each input contains a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters**

The code execution has the following effects on the program state:

- The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is an even positive integer, its value remains unchanged. Stdin now contains `t-5` inputs.
- The second line assigns the string value of the input to `row1`. Since `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, its value remains unchanged. Stdin now contains `t-6` inputs.
- The third line assigns the string value of the input to `row2`. Since `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, its value remains unchanged. Stdin now contains `t-7` inputs.
- The fourth line appends the output of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` to the `results` list. Since `results` initially contained one element, it now contains two elements. The first element is the output of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` before the code execution, and the second element is the output of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` after the code execution.

No other variables are affected by the code execution.
