The code prints the results of the function func_1(n, row1, row2) for t number of times, where n is an even positive integer, row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, and t is at least t.

Output: **the results of the function func_1(n, row1, row2) for t number of times (where n is an even positive integer, row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, and t is at least t)**
