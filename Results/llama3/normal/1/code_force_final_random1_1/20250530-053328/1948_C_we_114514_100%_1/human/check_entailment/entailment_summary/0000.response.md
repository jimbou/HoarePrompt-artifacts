Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and moves according to specific rules.

Function `func_1` takes the number of columns `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` representing the arrows in the grid as input. It checks if the robot can move from position (1,1) to (2,n) by examining the arrows in the grid. The function returns 'Yes' if the movement is possible and 'No' otherwise.

Function `func_2` reads input from the user, processes each test case, and prints the results. It calls `func_1` with the input values and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that `func_1` correctly determines whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the input grid, and `func_2` correctly reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
