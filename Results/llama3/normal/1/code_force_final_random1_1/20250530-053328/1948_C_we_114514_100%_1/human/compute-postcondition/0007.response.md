Output State: **t is at least t, results is a list containing t elements, each element is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2), n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be at least equal to its initial value, the `results` list will contain `t` elements, each of which is the output of the function `func_1` called with the current values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2`. The values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` will remain unchanged, and the standard input (`stdin`) will be empty, containing no more inputs.
