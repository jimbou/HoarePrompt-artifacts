Output State: **t is at least 1, results is a list containing three elements, the first element is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2) before the code execution, the second element is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2) after the code execution, the third element is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2) after the code execution, n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, stdin contains t-10 inputs: each input contains a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains at least 1, as it was not modified by the code. The `results` list now contains three elements: the first two elements are the same as before the code execution, and the third element is the output of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` after the code execution. The values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are updated based on the input values. The `n` is an even positive integer, and `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The stdin now contains `t-10` inputs, each containing a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters.
