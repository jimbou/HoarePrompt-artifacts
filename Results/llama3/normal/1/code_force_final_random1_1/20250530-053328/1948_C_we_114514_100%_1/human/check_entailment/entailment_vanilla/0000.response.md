Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns. The grid contains arrows pointing either left or right, and the robot moves according to certain rules.

Function 1, `func_1`, takes the number of columns `n`, and the two rows of the grid as input. It first calculates the middle column index `half_n`. Then, it iterates over the first half of the columns (excluding the last column) and checks if the current column in the first row points to the left and if the corresponding columns in the second row point to the left. If this condition is met, it returns 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). If this condition is not met for any column, it checks the last column in the first row and the second last column in the second row. If both point to the left, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads the input and processes each test case. It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the number of columns `n`, the two rows of the grid, and calls `func_1` to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). It appends the result to the list `results` and finally prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description. It correctly handles the edge cases and the conditions for the robot to reach the target cell.

Correctness: **True**
