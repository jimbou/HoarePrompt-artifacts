The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be at least 2.
State: **t is at least 2, results is a list containing one element which is the output of func_1(n, row1, row2), n is an even positive integer, row1 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, row2 is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, stdin contains t-4 inputs: each input contains a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters**
