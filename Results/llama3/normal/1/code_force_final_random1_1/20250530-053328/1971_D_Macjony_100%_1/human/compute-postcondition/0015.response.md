Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s has at least 3 characters, j is 1, and j must be less than len(s) - 1. If the string s at index j is not equal to the string s at index j+1, then count is increased by 1. If the string s at index j is '0' and at index j+1 is '1', then flag is True. Otherwise, the state of flag is not changed.***
