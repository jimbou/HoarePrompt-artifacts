Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `count` is increased by 1, `j` is 1, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s has at least 3 characters, and j must be less than len(s) - 1**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `i`, `j`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The conditions on `j` and the length of the strings in stdin are still valid.
