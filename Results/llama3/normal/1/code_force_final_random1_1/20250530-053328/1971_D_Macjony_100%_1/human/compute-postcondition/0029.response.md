The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s has at least 2 characters, j is equal to len(s) - 1, and count is printed. count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different minus 1 if there exists a pair of adjacent characters in s where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1', otherwise count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different.**
