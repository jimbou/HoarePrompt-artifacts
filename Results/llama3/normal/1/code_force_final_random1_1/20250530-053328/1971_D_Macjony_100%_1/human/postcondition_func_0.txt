This function reads a series of binary strings from standard input, counts the number of pairs of adjacent characters that are different in each string, and prints the count. If a string contains a pair of adjacent characters where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1', the count is decremented by 1. The function processes multiple strings, as specified by an initial integer input, and leaves the input strings unchanged.
