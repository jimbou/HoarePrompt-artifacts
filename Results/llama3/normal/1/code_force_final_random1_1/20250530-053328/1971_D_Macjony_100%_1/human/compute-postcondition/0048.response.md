Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `s` has at least 4 characters, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, and `count` is increased by 1. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.***
