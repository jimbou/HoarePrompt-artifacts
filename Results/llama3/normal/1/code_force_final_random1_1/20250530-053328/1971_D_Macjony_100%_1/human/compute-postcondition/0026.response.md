Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s has at least 2 characters, j is equal to len(s) - 1. If there exists a pair of adjacent characters in s where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1', then count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different minus 1. Otherwise, count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different.***
