Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `count` is increased by 1, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s has at least 3 characters, `len(s)` is at least 3, count is increased by 1 if the string s at index j-1 is not equal to the string s at index j, and flag is True if the string s at index j-1 is '0' and at index j is '1'. If the string s at index j is '0' and at index j+1 is '1', then count is increased by 1 and flag is True.***
