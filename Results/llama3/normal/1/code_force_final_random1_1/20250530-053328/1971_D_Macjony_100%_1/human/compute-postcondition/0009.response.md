Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s has at least 2 characters. If the character at index j in string s is not equal to the character at index j+1 in string s, then count is 2, j is 0, and if the character at index j in string s is '0' and the character at index j+1 in string s is '1', then flag is True. Otherwise, flag is False. If the character at index j in string s is equal to the character at index j+1 in string s, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
