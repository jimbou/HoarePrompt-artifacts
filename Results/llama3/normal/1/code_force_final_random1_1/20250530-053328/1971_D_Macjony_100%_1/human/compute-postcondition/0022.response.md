Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, stdin contains t-2 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s has at least 3 characters, `len(s)` is at least 3. If the string s at index j is not equal to the string s at index j+1, then count is increased by 1. If the string s at index j-1 is not equal to the string s at index j, then count is increased by 1. If the string s at index j-1 is '0' and at index j is '1', then flag is True. If the string s at index j is '0' and at index j+1 is '1', then count is increased by 1 and flag is True.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the strings `s` at different indices are still valid, but now they are applied to the updated value of `j`. The stdin contains `t-2` strings, as one string has been processed.
