Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s is a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, count is 1, flag is False, j is 0
Code of the loop:
while j < len(s) - 1:
    if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
        count += 1
        if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
            flag = True
    j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s has at least 2 characters. If the character at index j in string s is not equal to the character at index j+1 in string s, then count is 2, j is 1, and if the character at index j in string s is '0' and the character at index j+1 in string s is '1', then flag is True. Otherwise, flag is False. If the character at index j in string s is equal to the character at index j+1 in string s, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s has at least 3 characters, `j` is increased by 1, and if the string s at index j-1 is not equal to the string s at index j, then count is increased by 1. If the string s at index j-1 is '0' and at index j is '1', then flag is True. Otherwise, the state of flag is not changed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, stdin contains t-2 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s has at least 3 characters, `len(s)` is at least 3. If the string s at index j is not equal to the string s at index j+1, then count is increased by 1. If the string s at index j-1 is not equal to the string s at index j, then count is increased by 1. If the string s at index j-1 is '0' and at index j is '1', then flag is True. If the string s at index j is '0' and at index j+1 is '1', then count is increased by 1 and flag is True.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
