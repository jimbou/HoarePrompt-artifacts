Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings `s`, `j` is 1, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters 0 and 1, and `s` has at least 3 characters. If `s[j-1]` is not equal to `s[j]`, then `count` is 2. If the current value of `s[j-1]` is '0' and the current value of `s[j]` is '1', then `flag` is True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is 3. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
