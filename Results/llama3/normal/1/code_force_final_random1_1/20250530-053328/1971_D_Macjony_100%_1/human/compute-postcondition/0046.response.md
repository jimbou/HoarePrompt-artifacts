Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `s` has at least 4 characters, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, and `count` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still at least 2, `i` is still 1, `j` is still 2, and `s` is still a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters 0 and 1, with at least 4 characters. The stdin still contains `t-2` strings.
