Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s has at least 2 characters, `count` is 2, `flag` is False, `j` is 0. The current value of `j` is such that the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `j+1` in string `s`. The current value of `j` is such that the character at index `j` in string `s` is '0' and the character at index `j+1` in string `s` is '1'.***
