Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    count = 1
    flag = False
    j = 0
    while j < len(s) - 1:
        if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
            count += 1
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                flag = True
        j += 1
    if flag:
        count -= 1
    print(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s has at least 2 characters, j is equal to len(s) - 1, and count is printed. count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different minus 1 if there exists a pair of adjacent characters in s where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1', otherwise count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: j is equal to len(s) - 1, count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different, and flag is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent characters in s where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1'. If flag is True, then count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different minus one. Otherwise, count remains the same, and the count of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different (count) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: j is equal to len(s) - 1, count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different, s is unchanged, i is equal to t, t is equal to t, stdin is empty. If there is at least one pair of adjacent characters '0' and '1' in s, then count is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged., and the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different, which is count, is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
