The only variable in the loop head is variable j and s, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and s.  If j is less than len(s) - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 2 and s has at least 3 characters, So for the loop to be executed one more time s must have at least 4 characters.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters 0 and 1, and `s` has at least 4 characters**
