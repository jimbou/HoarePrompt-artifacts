Output: **j is equal to len(s) - 1, count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different, and flag is True if there is at least one pair of adjacent characters in s where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1'. If flag is True, then count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different minus one. Otherwise, count remains the same, and the count of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different (count) is being printed**
