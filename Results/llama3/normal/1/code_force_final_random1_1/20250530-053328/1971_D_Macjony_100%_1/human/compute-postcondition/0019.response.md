Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `count` is increased by 1, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s has at least 3 characters, `len(s)` is at least 3, count is increased by 1 if the string s at index j-1 is not equal to the string s at index j, flag is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still at least 1, `i` is still 0, `j` is still 1, `count` is still increased by 1, stdin still contains t-1 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, s still has at least 3 characters, `len(s)` is still at least 3, count is still increased by 1 if the string s at index j-1 is not equal to the string s at index j, and flag is now True.
