Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program works by iterating through the input string and counting the number of times the character changes from '0' to '1' or vice versa. This count represents the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the string into. The program also checks if the string is already sorted (i.e., all '0's come before all '1's) and if so, it subtracts 1 from the count.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* Strings that are already sorted
* Strings that are not sorted but can be rearranged into a sorted string by cutting into a minimum number of pieces
* Strings that consist of only '0's or only '1's
* Strings of length 1

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
