Postcondition: ***j is 1, count is 1 or 2 or 3, s has at least 3 characters, i is equal to t, t is equal to t, stdin is empty. If the first character of s is '0' and the second character of s is '1', then flag is True. Otherwise, flag is False. If the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index j+1 in s, then count is 2 or 3. Otherwise, count is 1 or 2.***
