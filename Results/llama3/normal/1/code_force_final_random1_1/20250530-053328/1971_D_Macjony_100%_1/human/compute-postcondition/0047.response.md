Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `s` has at least 4 characters, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, `count` is increased by 1, and `flag` is True.**

In this output state, the value of `flag` has been set to `True`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `s` has at least 4 characters, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, and `count` is increased by 1 is still valid.
