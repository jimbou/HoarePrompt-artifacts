Postcondition: ***j is equal to len(s) - 1, count is equal to the number of pairs of adjacent characters in s that are different, s is unchanged, i is equal to t, t is equal to t, stdin is empty. If there is at least one pair of adjacent characters '0' and '1' in s, then count is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
