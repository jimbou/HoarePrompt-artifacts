The `print(math.ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2.

Since `k` is the second integer in the second line of the file object `open(0)`, its value is not explicitly provided. However, we can describe its value as the second integer in the second line of the file object `open(0)`.

The `math.ceil` function returns the smallest integer not less than the given number. Therefore, the output will be the smallest integer not less than the result of dividing `k` by 2.

Output: **the ceiling of the division of the second integer in the second line of the file object open(0) by 2**
