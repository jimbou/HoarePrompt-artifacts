The code prints the value of `2 * n`, where `n` is an integer.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `2 * n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output twice the value of `n`.

Output: **2n (where n is the integer value of n)**
