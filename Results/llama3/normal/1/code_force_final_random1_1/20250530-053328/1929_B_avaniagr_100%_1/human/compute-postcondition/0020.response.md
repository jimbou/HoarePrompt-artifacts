The code prints the result of the expression `2 * n - 1`, where `n` is the first integer in the second line of the file object `open(0)`. Since `n` is an integer, the expression `2 * n - 1` will also evaluate to an integer.

Output: **an odd integer (2 times the first integer in the second line of the file object open(0), minus 1)**
