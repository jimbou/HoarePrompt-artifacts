The code prints the value of the expression `2 * n - 1`, where `n` is an integer.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `2 * n - 1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `2 * n - 1`.

Output: **2n - 1 (where n is an integer)**
