Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the file object open(0) has at least 1 line, s is the first line in the file object open(0), and k is larger than 4 * n - 4. If k is equal to 4 * n - 3, then 2 * n - 1 is printed. If k is equal to 4 * n - 2, then 2 times n is printed.***
