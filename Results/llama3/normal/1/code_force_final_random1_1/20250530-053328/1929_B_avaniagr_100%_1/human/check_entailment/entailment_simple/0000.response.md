Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n, such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program provided uses a simple and efficient approach to solve this problem.

The program first checks if k is less than or equal to 4n - 4. In this case, it prints the ceiling of k divided by 2, which is the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to cover at least k diagonals. This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals, so we need at least k/2 cells to cover k diagonals.

If k is equal to 4n - 3, the program prints 2n - 1. This is because in this case, we need to color all cells in one row or column, which covers 2n - 1 diagonals, and one more cell to cover the remaining diagonal.

If k is equal to 4n - 2, the program prints 2n. This is because in this case, we need to color all cells in two rows or columns, which covers all 4n - 2 diagonals.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to cover at least k diagonals.

Correctness: **True**
