Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the file object open(0) has at least 2 lines, `n` is the first integer in the second line of the file object open(0), and `k` is the second integer in the second line of the file object open(0). If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 3, then the value of 2 times `n` minus 1 is printed. Otherwise, if `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 2, then the value of 2 times `n` is printed.***
