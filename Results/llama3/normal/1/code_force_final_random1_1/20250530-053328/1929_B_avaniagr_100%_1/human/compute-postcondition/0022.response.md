Based on the initial state, we know that `n` is the first integer in the second line of the file object `open(0)`, and `k` is the second integer in the second line of the file object `open(0)`. However, the value of `k` is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement `print(2 * n)` will multiply the value of `n` by 2 and print the result.

Since we don't know the exact value of `n`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `2 * n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output twice the value of `n`.

Output: **twice the value of n (where n is the first integer in the second line of the file object open(0))**
