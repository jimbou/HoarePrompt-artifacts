Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the file object open(0) has at least 1 line, and s is the first line in the file object open(0). If `k` is less than or equal to 4 times the value of `n` minus 4, the ceiling of half of `k` is printed. If `k` is larger than 4 * n - 4, then if `k` is equal to 4 * n - 3, 2 * n - 1 is printed, otherwise if `k` is equal to 4 * n - 2, 2 times n is printed.***
