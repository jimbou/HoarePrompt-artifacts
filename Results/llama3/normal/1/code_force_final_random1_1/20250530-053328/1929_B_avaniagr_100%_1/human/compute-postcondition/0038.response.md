Output State: **The loop has executed for all the iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the output of the loop for each iteration.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the output of the loop for each iteration. The loop has executed for all the iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the output of the loop for each iteration.

Here is the detailed output state:

* `n` and `k` are integers
* `stdin` contains multiple lines of input
* The file object `open(0)` has at least `t` lines, where `t` is the number of test cases
* For each iteration, `n` is the first integer in the corresponding line of the file object `open(0)`, and `k` is the second integer in the corresponding line of the file object `open(0)`
* If `k` is less than or equal to 4 times `n` minus 4, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed
* If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 3, then 2 times the value of `n` minus 1 is printed
* If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 2, then the value of 2 times `n` is printed

Note that the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the output of the loop for each iteration. The loop has executed for all the iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the output of the loop for each iteration.
