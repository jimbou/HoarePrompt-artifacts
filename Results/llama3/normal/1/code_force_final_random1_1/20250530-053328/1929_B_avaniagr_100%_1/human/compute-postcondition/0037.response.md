Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input, the file object `open(0)` has at least 3 lines, `n` is the first integer in the string `s` and `k` is the second integer in the string `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to 4 times `n` minus 4, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is being printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 3, then 2 times the value of `n` minus 1 is being printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 2, then the value of 2 times `n` is being printed.***
