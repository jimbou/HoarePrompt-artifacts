Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the file object open(0) has at least 2 lines, `n` is the first integer in the second line of the file object open(0), and `k` is the second integer in the second line of the file object open(0).**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to be the first and second integers in the second line of the file object open(0), respectively. The other conditions in the initial state remain the same, including the presence of multiple lines of input in stdin and the file object open(0) having at least 2 lines.
