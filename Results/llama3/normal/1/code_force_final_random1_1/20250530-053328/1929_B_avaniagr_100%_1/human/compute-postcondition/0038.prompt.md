Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2) — the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    if k <= 4 * n - 4:
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    elif k == 4 * n - 3:
        print(2 * n - 1)
    elif k == 4 * n - 2:
        print(2 * n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the file object open(0) has at least 1 line, and s is the first line in the file object open(0). If `k` is less than or equal to 4 times the value of `n` minus 4, the ceiling of half of `k` is printed. If `k` is larger than 4 * n - 4, then if `k` is equal to 4 * n - 3, 2 * n - 1 is printed, otherwise if `k` is equal to 4 * n - 2, 2 times n is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the file object open(0) has at least 2 lines, `n` is the first integer in the second line of the file object open(0), and `k` is the second integer in the second line of the file object open(0). If `k` is less than or equal to 4 times `n` minus 4, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 3, the value of 2 times `n` minus 1 is printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 2, the value of 2 times `n` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input, the file object `open(0)` has at least 3 lines, `n` is the first integer in the string `s` and `k` is the second integer in the string `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to 4 times `n` minus 4, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is being printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 3, then 2 times the value of `n` minus 1 is being printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 2, then the value of 2 times `n` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
