The code prints the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2.
Since `k` is the second integer in the string `s`, the value of `k` is not explicitly known.
However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2.
Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is the second integer in the string s)**
