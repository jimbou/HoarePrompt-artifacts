Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the file object open(0) has at least 2 lines, `n` is the first integer in the second line of the file object open(0), and `k` is the second integer in the second line of the file object open(0). If `k` is less than or equal to 4 times `n` minus 4, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 3, the value of 2 times `n` minus 1 is printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 2, the value of 2 times `n` is printed.***
