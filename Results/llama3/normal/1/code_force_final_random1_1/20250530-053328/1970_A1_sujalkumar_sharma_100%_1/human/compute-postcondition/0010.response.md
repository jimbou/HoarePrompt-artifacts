Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `prefix_balance` is a list containing two tuples ((0, 0, s[0]) and (balance, i, s[i])), `i` is 1, `balance` is either 2 if the first character of `s` is an open parenthesis "(" or 0 if the first character of `s` is a close parenthesis ")"**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been updated by incrementing it by 1. If the first character of `s` is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is now 2. If the first character of `s` is a close parenthesis ")", then `balance` is now 0. The values of the other variables remain the same.
