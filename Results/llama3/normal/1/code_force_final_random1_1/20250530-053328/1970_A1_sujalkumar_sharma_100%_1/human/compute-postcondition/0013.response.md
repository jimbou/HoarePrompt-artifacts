The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `prefix_balance` is a list containing two tuples ((0, 0, s[0]) and (balance, i, s[i])), `i` is 2. If the first character of `s` is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is either 2 if the second character of `s` is also an open parenthesis "(" or 0 if the second character of `s` is a close parenthesis ")". If the first character of `s` is a close parenthesis ")", then `balance` is either 0 if the second character of `s` is an open parenthesis "(" or -2 if the second character of `s` is a close parenthesis ")"**
