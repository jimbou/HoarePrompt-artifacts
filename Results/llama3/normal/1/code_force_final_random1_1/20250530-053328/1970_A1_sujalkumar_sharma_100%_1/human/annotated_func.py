#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence.

    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `prefix_balance` is a list containing `n` tuples ((0, 0, s[0]), (balance, 1, s[1]), ..., (balance, n-1, s[n-1])), `i` is `n-1`, and `balance` is 0.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string consisting of characters "(" and ")" in a sorted order based on their balance and index in the original string s.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input and returns a new string with the same characters sorted by their balance and original index. The function does not modify the input string.
