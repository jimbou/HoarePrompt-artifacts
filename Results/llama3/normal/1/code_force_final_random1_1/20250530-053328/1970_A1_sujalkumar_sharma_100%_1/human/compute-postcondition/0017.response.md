Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `prefix_balance` is a list containing three tuples ((0, 0, s[0]), (balance, 1, s[1]), and (balance, 2, s[2])), `i` is 2. If the first two characters of `s` are both "(", then `balance` is 3. If the first character of `s` is "(" and the second character is ")", then `balance` is 1. If the first character of `s` is ")" and the second character is "(", then `balance` is -1. If the first two characters of `s` are both ")", then `balance` is -3.**
