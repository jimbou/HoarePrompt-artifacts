According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `prefix_balance` is an empty list, and `balance` is 0. However, these states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `prefix_balance` is an empty list, `balance` is 0, `i` is 0**
