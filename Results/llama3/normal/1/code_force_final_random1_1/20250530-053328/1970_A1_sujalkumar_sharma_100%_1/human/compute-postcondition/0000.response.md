Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, prefix_balance is an empty list, balance is 0**

The code assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`, creates an empty list `prefix_balance`, and initializes the variable `balance` to 0. Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, its length is a positive integer. The list `prefix_balance` remains empty, and the variable `balance` is set to 0. No other variables are affected.
