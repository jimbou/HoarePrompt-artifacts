Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple ((0, 0, s[0])), `balance` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current character at index `i` in string `s` is an open parenthesis "("**

The code increments the `balance` variable by 1. Since the initial value of `balance` was 0, its new value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` is still a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is still the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `prefix_balance` is still a list containing one tuple ((0, 0, s[0])), and `i` is still 0. The current character at index `i` in string `s` is still an open parenthesis "(".
