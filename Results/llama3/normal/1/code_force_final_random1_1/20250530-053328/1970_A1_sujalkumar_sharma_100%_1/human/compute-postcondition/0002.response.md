Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple ((0, 0, s[0])), `balance` is 0, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` and `n` remains the same as in the initial state. The `prefix_balance` list now contains one tuple, which includes the initial balance (0), the initial index (0), and the first character of the string `s` (s[0]). The values of `balance` and `i` also remain unchanged.
