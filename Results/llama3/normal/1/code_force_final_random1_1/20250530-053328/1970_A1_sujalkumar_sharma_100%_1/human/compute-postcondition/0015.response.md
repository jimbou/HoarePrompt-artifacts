Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `prefix_balance` is a list containing three tuples ((0, 0, s[0]), (balance, 1, s[1]), and (balance, 2, s[2])), `i` is 2, and `balance` is either 3 if the first two characters of `s` are both "(" or 1 if the first character of `s` is "(" and the second character is ")" or -1 if the first character of `s` is ")" and the second character is "(" or -3 if the first two characters of `s` are both ")"**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` remains the same, the length of `s` is still greater than 2, the list `prefix_balance` remains unchanged, and the index `i` is still 2. However, the value of `balance` has increased by 1. If the first two characters of `s` are both "(", then `balance` is now 3. If the first character of `s` is "(" and the second character is ")", then `balance` is now 1. If the first character of `s` is ")" and the second character is "(", then `balance` is now -1. If the first two characters of `s` are both ")", then `balance` is now -3.
