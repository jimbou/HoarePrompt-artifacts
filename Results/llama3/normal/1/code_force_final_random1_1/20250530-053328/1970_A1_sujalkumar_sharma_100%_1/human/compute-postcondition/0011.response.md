Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `prefix_balance` is a list containing two tuples ((0, 0, s[0]) and (balance-1, i, s[i])), `i` is 1, If the first character of `s` is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is 0. If the first character of `s` is a close parenthesis ")", then `balance` is -2.**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been decremented by 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The `prefix_balance` list still contains two tuples, but the second tuple now has an updated `balance` value. The string `s`, its length `n`, and the index `i` remain the same.
