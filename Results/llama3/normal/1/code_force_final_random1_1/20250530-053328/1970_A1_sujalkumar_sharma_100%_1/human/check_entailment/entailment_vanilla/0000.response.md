Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to implement the balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. The operation involves computing the prefix balance of the input sequence, sorting the columns of the table in increasing order of prefix balance and breaking ties in decreasing order of position, and then forming a new parentheses sequence from the last row of the sorted table.

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the balanced shuffle of `s`.

3. Inside `func_1`, the program first initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store the prefix balance, position, and character of each prefix in the input sequence. It also initializes a variable `balance` to keep track of the current balance.

4. The program then iterates over the input sequence `s`. For each character, it appends a tuple containing the current balance, position, and character to the `prefix_balance` list. If the character is an opening parenthesis, it increments the balance; otherwise, it decrements the balance.

5. After iterating over the entire input sequence, the program sorts the `prefix_balance` list in increasing order of prefix balance and breaking ties in decreasing order of position using the `sort` method with a custom key function.

6. Finally, the program forms the balanced shuffle by joining the characters in the sorted `prefix_balance` list and returns the result.

7. The main part of the program reads a string `s` from the input, calls `func_1` with `s` as an argument, and prints the returned result.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
