To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head variables, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, it must also be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple ((0, 0, s[0])), `i` is 1. If the first character of `s` is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is 1. If the first character of `s` is a close parenthesis ")", then `balance` is -1.**
