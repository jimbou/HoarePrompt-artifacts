Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple ((0, 0, s[0])), `balance` is -1, `i` is 0, and the first character of `s` is ")"**

The code decreases the value of `balance` by 1. Since the initial value of `balance` is 0, it becomes -1 after the execution of the code. The other variables remain unchanged.
