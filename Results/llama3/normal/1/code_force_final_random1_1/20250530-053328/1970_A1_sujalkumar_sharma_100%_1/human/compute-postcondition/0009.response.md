Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `prefix_balance` is a list containing two tuples ((0, 0, s[0]) and (balance, i, s[i])), `i` is 1, If the first character of `s` is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is 1. If the first character of `s` is a close parenthesis ")", then `balance` is -1.**

In this output state, the value of `prefix_balance` has been updated to include a new tuple containing the current balance, the index `i`, and the character at index `i` in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
