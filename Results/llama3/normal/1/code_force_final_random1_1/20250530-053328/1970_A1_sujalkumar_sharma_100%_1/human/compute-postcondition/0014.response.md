Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `prefix_balance` is a list containing three tuples ((0, 0, s[0]), (balance, 1, s[1]), and (balance, 2, s[2])), `i` is 2. If the first character of `s` is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is either 2 if the second character of `s` is also an open parenthesis "(" or 0 if the second character of `s` is a close parenthesis ")". If the first character of `s` is a close parenthesis ")", then `balance` is either 0 if the second character of `s` is an open parenthesis "(" or -2 if the second character of `s` is a close parenthesis ")"**

In this output state, the value of `balance` in the third tuple of `prefix_balance` is determined by the first two characters of `s`. If `s` starts with an open parenthesis, `balance` is either 2 (if the second character is also an open parenthesis) or 0 (if the second character is a close parenthesis). If `s` starts with a close parenthesis, `balance` is either 0 (if the second character is an open parenthesis) or -2 (if the second character is a close parenthesis). The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
