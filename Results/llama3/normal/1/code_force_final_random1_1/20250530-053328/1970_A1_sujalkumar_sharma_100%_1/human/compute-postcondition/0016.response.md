Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `prefix_balance` is a list containing three tuples ((0, 0, s[0]), (balance, 1, s[1]), and (balance, 2, s[2])), `i` is 2. If the first character of `s` is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is either 1 if the second character of `s` is also an open parenthesis "(" or -1 if the second character of `s` is a close parenthesis ")". If the first character of `s` is a close parenthesis ")", then `balance` is either -1 if the second character of `s` is an open parenthesis "(" or -3 if the second character of `s` is a close parenthesis ")"**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `balance` has been decremented by 1. The value of `balance` now depends on the first two characters of the string `s`. If the first character is an open parenthesis and the second character is also an open parenthesis, then `balance` is 1. If the first character is an open parenthesis and the second character is a close parenthesis, then `balance` is -1. If the first character is a close parenthesis and the second character is an open parenthesis, then `balance` is -1. If the first character is a close parenthesis and the second character is a close parenthesis, then `balance` is -3.
