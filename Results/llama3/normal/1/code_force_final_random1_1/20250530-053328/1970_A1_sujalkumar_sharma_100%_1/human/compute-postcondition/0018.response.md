Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `prefix_balance` is a list containing `n` tuples ((0, 0, s[0]), (balance, 1, s[1]), ..., (balance, n-1, s[n-1])), `i` is `n-1`, and `balance` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same string `s` and its length `n`. The `prefix_balance` list will contain `n` tuples, each representing the balance and index of each character in the string. The `i` variable will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all characters in the string. Finally, the `balance` variable will be 0, indicating that the string is a balanced parentheses sequence.
