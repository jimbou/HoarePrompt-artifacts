Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of signs, and the periodicities of the signs as input.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and stores it in the variable `t`.
2. It then reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a` for each test case and stores them in a list of tuples `test_cases`.
3. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases` as input.
4. Inside the function, it iterates over each test case and initializes a variable `current_year` to 0.
5. For each sign in the test case, it checks if the current year is a multiple of the sign's periodicity `ai`. If it is, it calculates the next year by adding `ai` to the current year. If it's not, it calculates the next year by rounding up the current year to the nearest multiple of `ai`.
6. It updates the `current_year` variable with the calculated next year.
7. After processing all signs in the test case, it appends the final `current_year` value to the `results` list.
8. Finally, it returns the `results` list, which contains the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
