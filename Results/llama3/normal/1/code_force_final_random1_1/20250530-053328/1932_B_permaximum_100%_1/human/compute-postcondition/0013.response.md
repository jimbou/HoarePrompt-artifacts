Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`. If the current year is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.***
