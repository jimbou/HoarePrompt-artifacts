Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, `next_year` is `current_year + ai`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables retain their initial values, and a new variable `next_year` is introduced, which is equal to the sum of `current_year` and `ai`, where `ai` is the second element in the list `a`.
