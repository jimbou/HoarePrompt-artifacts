This function takes a list of test cases, where each test case contains a positive integer 'n' followed by 'n' positive integers. It processes each test case by iterating through the integers and finding the smallest multiple of the last integer that is greater than or equal to the initial value. The function returns a list of these smallest multiples, one for each test case.
