Output State: **The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` for each test case in `test_cases`.**

In this output state, each integer in the list represents the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` for a specific test case. The list is empty because `test_cases` is an empty list.
