Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `current_year` has been updated to be equal to `next_year`. The value of `next_year` depends on whether `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`. If it is, then `next_year` is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.
