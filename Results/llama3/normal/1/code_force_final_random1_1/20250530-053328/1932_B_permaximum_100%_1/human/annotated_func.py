    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` for each test case in `test_cases`, `test` is the last test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the last test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the last test case in `test_cases`, `ai` is the last element in `a`, and `current_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` for the last test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` for each test case in `test_cases`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of test cases, where each test case contains a positive integer 'n' followed by 'n' positive integers. It processes each test case by iterating through the integers and finding the smallest multiple of the last integer that is greater than or equal to the initial value. The function returns a list of these smallest multiples, one for each test case.
