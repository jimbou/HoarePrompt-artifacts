Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`. If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, then `next_year` is `current_year` plus `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`. `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `current_year` has been updated to be equal to `next_year`. This means that `current_year` is now either the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to its initial value, or its initial value plus `ai` if it was already a multiple of `ai`.
