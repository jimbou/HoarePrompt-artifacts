Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `next_year` is calculated as the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list of test cases, results, and the current test case are still the same. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `ai` are also unchanged.
