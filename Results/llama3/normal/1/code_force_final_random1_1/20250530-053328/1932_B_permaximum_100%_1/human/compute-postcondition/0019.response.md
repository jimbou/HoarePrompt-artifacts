Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, `next_year` is `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` otherwise, and `current_year` is updated to `next_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `test`, `n`, `a`, and `ai` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `next_year` is still dependent on `current_year` and `ai`, but `current_year` is now updated to the value of `next_year`.
