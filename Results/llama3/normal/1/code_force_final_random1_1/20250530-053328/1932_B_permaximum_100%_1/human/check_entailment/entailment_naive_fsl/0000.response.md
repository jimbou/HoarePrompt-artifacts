Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, as described in the problem statement.

The program iterates through each sign's periodicity and calculates the next year when the sign will occur. If the current year is already a multiple of the sign's periodicity, it simply adds the periodicity to the current year. Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of the periodicity by dividing the current year by the periodicity, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by the periodicity.

The program correctly handles the case where the current year is already a multiple of the sign's periodicity, as well as the case where it is not. It also correctly updates the current year after each sign's occurrence.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles the examples provided in the problem statement, and I have not been able to think of any additional cases where the program would fail to produce the correct result. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
