Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.**

In this output state, the value of `next_year` is calculated based on the values of `current_year` and `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `current_year` is not specified in the initial state, so it is assumed to be some unknown value. The value of `next_year` is expressed in terms of `current_year` and `ai`, which are known values.
