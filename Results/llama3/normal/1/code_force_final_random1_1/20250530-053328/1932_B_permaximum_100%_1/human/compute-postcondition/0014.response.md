Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, `current_year` is `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `current_year` has been updated to be equal to `next_year`, which is either the current year plus `ai` if the current year is divisible by `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current year otherwise.
