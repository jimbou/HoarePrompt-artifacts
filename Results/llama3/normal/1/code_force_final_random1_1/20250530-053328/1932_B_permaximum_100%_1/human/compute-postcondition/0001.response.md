The only objects in the loop head are variables  test and list  test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 1 test case the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer and results is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 test case and the test is the first test case in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, test is the first test case in the list**
