Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `next_year` is calculated as the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `next_year` is specifically calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, which is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`.
