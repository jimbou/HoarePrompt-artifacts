Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, `current_year` is updated to `next_year` which is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`**

In this output state, the value of `next_year` is calculated by taking the ceiling of the division of `current_year` by `ai` and then multiplying it by `ai`. This ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.
