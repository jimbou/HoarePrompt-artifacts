To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ai` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements and `ai` is the second element in `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` and the new value of `current_year` which is either `current_year` + `ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the third test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, and `current_year` is updated to `next_year`.**
