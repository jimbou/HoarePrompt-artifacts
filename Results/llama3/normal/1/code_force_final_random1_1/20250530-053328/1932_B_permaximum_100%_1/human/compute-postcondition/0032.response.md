To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ai` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `a` has at least 2 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, and `ai` is the first element in `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `ai` must be the second element in `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`. If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, then `next_year` is `current_year` plus `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`. `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`.**
