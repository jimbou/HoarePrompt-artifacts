Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and stores it in the `test_cases` list.
2. The `func_1` function iterates through each test case and initializes the `current_year` variable to 0.
3. For each sign (represented by the integer `ai`), the program checks if the `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`. If it is, the next year is calculated by adding `ai` to `current_year`. If it's not, the next year is calculated by finding the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`. This is done by dividing `current_year` by `ai`, rounding up to the nearest integer using the `//` operator, and then multiplying by `ai`.
4. The program updates the `current_year` variable with the calculated `next_year` value.
5. After processing all signs for a test case, the program appends the final `current_year` value to the `results` list.
6. The program returns the `results` list, which contains the year in which all n signs will occur for each test case.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
