Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` for each test case in `test_cases`, `test` is the last test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the last test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the last test case in `test_cases`, `ai` is the last element in `a`, and `current_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` for the last test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains a positive integer, `test_cases` becomes an empty list because all test cases have been processed, `results` contains the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` for each test case in `test_cases`, and the variables `test`, `n`, `a`, `ai`, and `current_year` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
