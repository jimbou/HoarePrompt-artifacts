Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, and `next_year` is `current_year + ai`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `next_year` has been updated to be the sum of the current year and the third element in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
