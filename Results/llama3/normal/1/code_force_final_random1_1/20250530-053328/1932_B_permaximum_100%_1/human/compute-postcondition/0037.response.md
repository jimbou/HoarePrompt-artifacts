The only object in the loop head is variable  ai and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list a has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, ai is the second element in a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list a must have at least 3 elements and the ai is the third element in a.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, and `current_year` is updated to `next_year`.**
