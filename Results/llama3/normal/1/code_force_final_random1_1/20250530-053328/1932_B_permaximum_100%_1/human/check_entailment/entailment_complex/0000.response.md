Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and stores it in the `test_cases` list.
2. The `func_1` function iterates over each test case and initializes the `current_year` variable to 0.
3. For each sign in the test case, the program checks if the `current_year` is a multiple of the sign's periodicity (`ai`). If it is, the program sets the `next_year` to the next multiple of `ai` (i.e., `current_year + ai`). If it's not, the program sets the `next_year` to the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the `current_year` (i.e., `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`).
4. The program updates the `current_year` to the `next_year` and repeats the process for the next sign.
5. After processing all signs in a test case, the program appends the final `current_year` to the `results` list.
6. The program returns the `results` list, which contains the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
