To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ai` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `ai` is the last element in `a`, we need to adjust the state of `a` to have at least one element, and `ai` should be the first element in `a` for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, and `current_year` is 0**
