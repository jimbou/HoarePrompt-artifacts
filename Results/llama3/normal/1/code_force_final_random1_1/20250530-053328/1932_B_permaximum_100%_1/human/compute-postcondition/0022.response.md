Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `ai` is the last element in `a`, and `current_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.**

In natural language, after the code executes, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `test_cases`, `test`, `n`, `a`, `ai`, and `current_year` as in the initial state. The only change is that `results` now contains the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.
