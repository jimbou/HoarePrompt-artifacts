To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for test in test_cases:`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `test` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 3 test cases, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 2 test cases, and `test` is the second test case in the list.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `test_cases` must have at least 3 test cases, and `test` must be the third test case in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` and the new value of `current_year` which is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the third test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the last element in `a`, and `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.**
