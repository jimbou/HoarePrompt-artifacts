Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`. If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, then `current_year` is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `current_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `current_year` has been updated. If `current_year` was a multiple of `ai`, it has been incremented by `ai`. Otherwise, it has been set to the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
