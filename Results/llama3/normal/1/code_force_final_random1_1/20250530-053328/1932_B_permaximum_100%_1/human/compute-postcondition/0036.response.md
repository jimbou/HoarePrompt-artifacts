Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, and `current_year` is updated to `next_year`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `current_year`, which is now equal to `next_year`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `test`, `n`, `a`, and `ai` remain unchanged.
