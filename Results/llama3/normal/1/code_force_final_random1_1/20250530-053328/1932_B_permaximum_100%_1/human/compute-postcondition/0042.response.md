Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the last element in `a`, and `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that `t` remains a positive integer, `test_cases` still has at least 2 test cases, `results` contains the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is still the second test case, `n` is still the first element of the second test case, `a` is still the second element of the second test case and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is now the last element in `a`, and `current_year` is updated to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.
