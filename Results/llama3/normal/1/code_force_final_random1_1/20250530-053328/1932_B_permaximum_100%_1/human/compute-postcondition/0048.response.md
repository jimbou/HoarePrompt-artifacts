Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` and the new value of `current_year` which is equal to `next_year` which is `current_year + ai`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the third test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, and the current value of `current_year` is a multiple of `ai` and is now updated to `current_year + ai`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `next_year` is updated to be the sum of the current value of `current_year` and the first element of `a` (which is `ai`). The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The new value of `current_year` is now `current_year + ai`, which is also a multiple of `ai`.
