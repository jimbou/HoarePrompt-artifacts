The only variable in the loop head is variable  ai and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` must have at least 1 element and `ai` is the first element in `a`. 
State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in a that is greater than or equal to the initial value of current_year and the new value of current_year which is equal to next_year which is either current_year + ai if current_year is a multiple of ai, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of ai that is greater than or equal to the initial value of current_year, test is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case in test_cases, a is the second element of the third test case in test_cases and must have at least 1 element, ai is the first element in a, and current_year is 0**
