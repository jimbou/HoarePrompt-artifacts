Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, the new value of `current_year` which is either `current_year` + `ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, and the value of `current_year` that was just appended to `results`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the third test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the last element in `a`, and `current_year` is either `current_year` + `ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `results` now contains an additional element, which is the current value of `current_year`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being a positive integer, `test_cases` still having at least 3 test cases, `test` still being the third test case, `n` still being the first element of the third test case, `a` still being the second element of the third test case with at least 1 element, `ai` still being the last element in `a`, and `current_year` still being either `current_year` + `ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.
