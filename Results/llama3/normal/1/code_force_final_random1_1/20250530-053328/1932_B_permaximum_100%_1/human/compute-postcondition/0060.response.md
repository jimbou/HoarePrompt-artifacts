Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` and the new value of `current_year` which is either `current_year` + `ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the third test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, `current_year` is either `current_year` + `ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, and `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `next_year` which is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. The value of `next_year` is calculated by dividing `current_year` by `ai`, rounding down to the nearest whole number, adding 1, and then multiplying by `ai`. This ensures that `next_year` is always a multiple of `ai` and is greater than `current_year`.
