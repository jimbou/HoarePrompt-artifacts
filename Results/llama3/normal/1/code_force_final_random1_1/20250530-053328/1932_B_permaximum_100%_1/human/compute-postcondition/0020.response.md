Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, `ai` is the last element in `a`, `next_year` is `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` otherwise, and `current_year` is updated to `next_year`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `a`, updating the `current_year` variable according to the rules specified in the loop body. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
