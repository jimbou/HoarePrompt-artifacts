Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `ai` is the last element in `a`, and `current_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `test`, and `n` as in the initial state. The value of `a` will remain the same as in the initial state, but `ai` will be the last element in `a`. The value of `current_year` will be the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.
