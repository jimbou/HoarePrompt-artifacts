According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, which is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case. So for the loop to be executed, `a` must have at least 1 element and `ai` is the first element in `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `current_year` is 0**
