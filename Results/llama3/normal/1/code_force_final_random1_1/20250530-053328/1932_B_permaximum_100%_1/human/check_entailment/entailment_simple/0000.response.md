Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of signs and their periodicities. It then iterates over each sign and calculates the next year in which the sign will occur. If the current year is a multiple of the sign's periodicity, it simply adds the periodicity to the current year. Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of the periodicity that is greater than the current year.

The program then appends the final year to the results list and returns it.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program seems to be correct. It correctly calculates the next year in which each sign will occur and returns the final year in which the n-th sign will occur.

Correctness: **True**
