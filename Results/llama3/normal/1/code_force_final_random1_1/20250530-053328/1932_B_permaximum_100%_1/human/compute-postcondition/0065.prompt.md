Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists where each sublist contains a positive integer n followed by n positive integers, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for test in test_cases:
    n, a = test
    current_year = 0
    for ai in a:
        if current_year % ai == 0:
            next_year = current_year + ai
        else:
            next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
        current_year = next_year
    results.append(current_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `ai` is the last element in `a`, and `current_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` and the new value of `current_year` which is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the last element in `a`, and `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, the new value of `current_year` which is either `current_year` + `ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, and the value of `current_year` that was just appended to `results`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the third test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the last element in `a`, and `current_year` is either `current_year` + `ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
