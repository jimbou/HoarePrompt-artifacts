Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`. `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `next_year` is updated to be the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`. The value of `current_year` is then updated to be equal to this new value of `next_year`. All other variables remain unchanged.
