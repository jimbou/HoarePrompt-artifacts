To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for test in test_cases:`.

The only object in the loop head is `test` and `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If the `test_cases` has at least 2 test cases, the loop executes again for the second time.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `test_cases` must have at least 2 test cases and `test` is the second test case in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `ai` is the last element in `a`, and `current_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.**
