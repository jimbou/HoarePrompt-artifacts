Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, and `next_year` is `current_year + ai`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, and a new variable `next_year` is introduced, which is the sum of `current_year` and `ai`. Since `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, `next_year` will also be a multiple of `ai`.
