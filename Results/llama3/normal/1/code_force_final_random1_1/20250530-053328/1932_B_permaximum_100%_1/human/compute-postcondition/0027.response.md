Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, and `next_year` is `current_year` plus `ai`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables retain their initial values, except that a new variable `next_year` is introduced, which is the sum of the current year and the first element of the list `a`. The current year is still a multiple of the first element of `a`.
