Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, and the current value of `current_year` is a multiple of `ai` (i.e., `current_year` is 0 and `ai` is a factor of `current_year`).**
