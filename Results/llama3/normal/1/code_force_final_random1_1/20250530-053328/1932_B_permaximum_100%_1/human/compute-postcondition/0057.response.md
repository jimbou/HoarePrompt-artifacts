Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year` and the new value of `current_year` which is either `current_year` + `ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`, `test` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the third test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, and `current_year` is either `current_year` + `ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of `current_year` has been updated to be the same as `next_year`, which is either `current_year` + `ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `current_year`.
