Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the smallest multiple of the last element in a that is greater than or equal to the initial value of current_year, test is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case in test_cases, a is the second element of the second test case in test_cases, ai is the last element in a, and current_year is 0.**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `test`, `n`, `a`, or `ai`. However, it does change the value of `current_year` to 0. The initial value of `current_year` was the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to its initial value, but after the code executes, `current_year` becomes 0.
