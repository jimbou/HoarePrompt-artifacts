To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for ai in a:`. The only objects in the loop head are `ai` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `a` must have at least 3 elements and `ai` is the third element in `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, `current_year` is `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` otherwise.**
