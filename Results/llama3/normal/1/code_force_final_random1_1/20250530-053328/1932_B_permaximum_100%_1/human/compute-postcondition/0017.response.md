Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element of the first test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`.**

In this output state, the value of `next_year` has been updated to be the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`. This is calculated by dividing `current_year` by `ai`, rounding down to the nearest whole number, adding 1, and then multiplying by `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged.
