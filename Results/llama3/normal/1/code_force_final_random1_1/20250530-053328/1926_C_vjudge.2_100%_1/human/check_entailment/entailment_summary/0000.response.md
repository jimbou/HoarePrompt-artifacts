Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It uses dynamic programming to pre-calculate the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all integers from 1 to 200000. This is done by iterating over each integer, converting it to a string, and summing up the integer values of its digits. The cumulative sum is stored in the `pd` array.

The program then reads the input integers and prints the corresponding cumulative sum from the `pd` array. This approach is efficient because it avoids recalculating the cumulative sum for each input integer, which would be time-consuming for large inputs.

The time complexity of the program is O(N + t), where N is the maximum value (200000) and t is the number of test cases. This is within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Correctness: **True**
