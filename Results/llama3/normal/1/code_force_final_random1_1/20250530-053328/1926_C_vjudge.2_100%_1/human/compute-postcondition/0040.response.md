Output State: **`N` is 200001, `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than 10^4, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`, stdin contains one input: an integer, and the value of `pd[n]` which is the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `n` plus the previous element `pd[n-1]` is being printed, and `n` is returned, `_` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be an integer greater than 1 and less than 10^4, which is the input from the user. The value of `pd[n]` is being printed, and `n` is returned. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one input: an integer, which is the input provided by the user.
