The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1 and less than 10^4. So, `t` is decreased by 1.
State: **`N` is 200001, `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `n` is an integer, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`, stdin contains no input, and the value of `pd[n]` which is the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `n` plus the previous element `pd[n-1]` is being printed**
