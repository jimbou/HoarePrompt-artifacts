Output State: **`N` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i`, `pd[2]` is equal to `pd[1]` plus the integer value of the second character of the string `i`, `pd[i]` is equal to `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the third character of the string `i`, and the rest of the elements are zeros, `i` is a string with at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the third character of the string `i`**

In this output state, the value of `pd[i]` has been updated to include the integer value of the third character of the string `i`, which is stored in the variable `j`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
