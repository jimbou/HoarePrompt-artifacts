Output State: `N` is 200001, `t` is 0, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than 10^4, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`, stdin contains no input, and the value of `pd[n]` which is the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `n` plus the previous element `pd[n-1]` is being printed, and `n` is returned, `_` is equal to `t`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `pd` has been updated such that each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, and the string `i` has been fully processed. The other variables remain unchanged.
