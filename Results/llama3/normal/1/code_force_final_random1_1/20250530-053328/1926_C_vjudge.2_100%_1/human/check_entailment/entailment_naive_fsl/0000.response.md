Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a pre-computed array `pd` to store the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `N`, where `N` is the maximum possible input value. This allows the program to efficiently calculate the sum of the numbers on the board for any given input `n`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `n` is 1 or `N`. The program also correctly handles the case where `n` is a large number, as the pre-computed array `pd` allows the program to efficiently calculate the sum of the numbers on the board without having to iterate over all numbers from 1 to `n`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
