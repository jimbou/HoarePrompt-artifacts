To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to adjust its state. The state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`N` is 200001, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`**
