Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `N` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `pd` has been updated such that each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, and the string `i` has been fully processed. The other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print(pd[n])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is 200001, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `n` is an integer, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`, stdin contains no input, and the value of `pd[n]` which is the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `n` plus the previous element `pd[n-1]` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is 200001, `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than 10^4, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`, stdin contains no input, and the value of `pd[n]` which is the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `n` plus the previous element `pd[n-1]` is being printed, and `n` is returned.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is 200001, `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than 10^4, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`, stdin contains one input: an integer, and the value of `pd[n]` which is the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `n` plus the previous element `pd[n-1]` is being printed, and `n` is returned, `_` is 1, and the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `n` plus the previous element `pd[n-1]` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
