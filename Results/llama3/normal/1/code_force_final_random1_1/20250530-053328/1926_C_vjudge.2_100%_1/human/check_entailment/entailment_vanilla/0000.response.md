Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. The given program uses a pre-computation approach to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 2 * 10^5 in an array `pd`.

2. The program first initializes an array `pd` of size `N` (where `N` is 2 * 10^5 + 1) with all elements as 0. Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to `N` and for each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits by converting the number to a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting it back to an integer, and adding it to the cumulative sum stored in `pd[i]`.

3. After pre-computing the cumulative sums, the program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the cumulative sum stored in `pd[n]`, which represents the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits.

4. The time complexity of the program is O(N + t), where N is the size of the pre-computation array and t is the number of test cases. Since N is fixed (2 * 10^5 + 1) and t can be up to 10^4, the time complexity is dominated by the pre-computation step, which is within the allowed time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

5. The space complexity of the program is O(N), which is also within the allowed limits.

Correctness: **True**
