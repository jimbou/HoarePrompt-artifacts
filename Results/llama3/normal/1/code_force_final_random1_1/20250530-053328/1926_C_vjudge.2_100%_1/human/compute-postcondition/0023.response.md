To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in str(i):`, which means we're iterating over each character `j` in the string `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is a string with at least 1 character, and `j` is the first character of the string `i`.

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `j` and `i`. Since we've already processed the first character `j` in the previous iteration, we need to move on to the next character in the string `i`.

Here's the updated state:

* `j` is now the second character of the string `i` (since we've already processed the first character)
* `i` remains the same, as we're still iterating over the same string

The other variables in the state, such as `N`, `t`, `pd`, and `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and can remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is greater than 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i`, `pd[2]` is equal to `pd[1]` plus the integer value of the second character of the string `i`, `pd[3]` is equal to `pd[2]` plus the integer value of the third character of the string `i`, and so on until `pd[i-1]` is equal to `pd[i-2]` plus the integer value of the second last character of the string `i`, `pd[i]` is equal to `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the last character of the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]` plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i`, `i` is a string with at least 1 character, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the second character of the string `i`**
