Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, N is 200001, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, pd is a list of 200001 zeros
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, N):
    pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
    for j in str(i):
        pd[i] += int(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i`, `pd[2]` is equal to `pd[1]` plus the integer value of the second character of the string `i`, `pd[3]` is equal to `pd[2]` plus the integer value of the third character of the string `i`, and so on until `pd[i]` is equal to `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the last character of the string `i`, and the rest of the elements are zeros, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is greater than 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i`, `pd[2]` is equal to `pd[1]` plus the integer value of the second character of the string `i`, `pd[3]` is equal to `pd[2]` plus the integer value of the third character of the string `i`, and so on until `pd[i]` is equal to `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the last character of the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]`, and the rest of the elements are zeros except `pd[i]` which is now equal to `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the last character of the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]` plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `N` is greater than 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i`, `pd[2]` is equal to `pd[1]` plus the integer value of the second character of the string `i`, `pd[3]` is equal to `pd[2]` plus the integer value of the third character of the string `i`, and so on until `pd[i-1]` is equal to `pd[i-2]` plus the integer value of the second last character of the string `i`, `pd[i]` is equal to `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the last character of the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]` plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]` plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop plus one, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `pd` has been updated such that each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, and the string `i` has been fully processed. The other variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
