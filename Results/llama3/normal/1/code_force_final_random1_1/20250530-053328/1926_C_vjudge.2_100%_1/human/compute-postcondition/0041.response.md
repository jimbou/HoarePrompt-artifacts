The code prints the value of `pd[n]`, which is the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `n` plus the previous element `pd[n-1]`. Here, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than 10^4, and `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`. The value of `pd[n]` is being printed.

Output: **the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string n plus the previous element pd[n-1]**
