Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (between 1 and 10^4) and then a list of integers (between 1 and 2 * 10^5).
    N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1
    t = int(input())
    pd = [(0) for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(1, N):
        pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
        
        for j in str(i):
            pd[i] += int(j)
        
    #State: Output State: `N` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `pd` has been updated such that each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, and the string `i` has been fully processed. The other variables remain unchanged.
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(pd[n])
        
    #State: Output State: `N` is 200001, `t` is 0, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than 10^4, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`, stdin contains no input, and the value of `pd[n]` which is the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `n` plus the previous element `pd[n-1]` is being printed, and `n` is returned, `_` is `t`, and the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `n` plus the previous element `pd[n-1]` is being printed.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `pd` has been updated such that each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, and the string `i` has been fully processed. The other variables remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer `t` and a list of integers from standard input, calculates the cumulative sum of the integer values of all characters in the string representation of each integer from 1 to 200000, and then prints the cumulative sum for each of the `t` input integers.
