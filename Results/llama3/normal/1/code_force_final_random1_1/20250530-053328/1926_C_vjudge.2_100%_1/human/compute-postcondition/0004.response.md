Output State: **`N` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i` and the rest of the elements are zeros, `i` is a string with at least 1 character, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the first character of the string `i`**

In this output state, the value of `pd[i]` has been updated by adding the integer value of the first character of the string `i` to it. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a list of integers as input.
