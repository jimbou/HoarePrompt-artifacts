Output State: **`N` is 200001, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `n` is an integer, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was read from the input, which was a list of integers. The stdin is now empty since it contained only one input. The values of the other variables, `N`, `t`, `pd`, `i`, and `j`, remain the same as in the initial state.
