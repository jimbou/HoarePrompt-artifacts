To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for j in str(i):`, which means we can only adjust the states of `j` and `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is a string with at least 1 character, and `j` is the first character of the string `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must have at least 2 characters, and `j` must be the second character of the string `i`.

State: **`N` is greater than 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i`, `pd[2]` is equal to `pd[1]` plus the integer value of the second character of the string `i`, `pd[3]` is equal to `pd[2]` plus the integer value of the third character of the string `i`, and so on until `pd[i]` is equal to `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the last character of the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]`, and the rest of the elements are zeros except `pd[i]` which is now equal to `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the last character of the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i`, `i` is a string with at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the second character of the string `i`.**
