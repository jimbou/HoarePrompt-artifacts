To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for j in str(i):`. The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `i`. Since `j` is iterating over the characters of `i`, we need to adjust the state of `j` and `i`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the second character of the string `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must have at least 3 characters, and `j` should be the third character of the string `i`.


State: **`N` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i` and `pd[i]` is equal to `pd[i]` plus the integer value of the second character of the string `i` and the rest of the elements are zeros, `i` is a string with at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the third character of the string `i`**
