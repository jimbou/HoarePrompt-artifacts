Output State: `N` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `pd` has been updated such that each element `pd[i]` is equal to the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`, and the string `i` has been fully processed. The other variables remain unchanged.
