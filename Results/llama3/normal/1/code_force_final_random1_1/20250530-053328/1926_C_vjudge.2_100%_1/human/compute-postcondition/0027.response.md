Output State: `N` is greater than 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i`, `pd[2]` is equal to `pd[1]` plus the integer value of the second character of the string `i`, `pd[3]` is equal to `pd[2]` plus the integer value of the third character of the string `i`, and so on until `pd[i-1]` is equal to `pd[i-2]` plus the integer value of the second last character of the string `i`, `pd[i]` is equal to `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the last character of the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]` plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]` plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i`, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop plus one, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `pd` has been updated such that each element `pd[i]` is the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]` plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i` plus the previous element `pd[i-1]`. The string `i` has the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop plus one, and the last character of the string `i` is stored in the variable `j`. The other variables `N`, `t`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
