The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, `N` is 200001. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than 2.
State: **`N` is greater than 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i`, `pd[2]` is equal to `pd[1]` plus the integer value of the second character of the string `i`, `pd[3]` is equal to `pd[2]` plus the integer value of the third character of the string `i`, and so on until `pd[i]` is equal to `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the last character of the string `i`, and the rest of the elements are zeros, `i` is a string with the same number of characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the last character of the string `i`**
