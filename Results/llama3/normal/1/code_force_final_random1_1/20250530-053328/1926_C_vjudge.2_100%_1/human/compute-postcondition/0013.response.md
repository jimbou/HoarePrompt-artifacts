Output State: **`N` is greater than 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i`, `pd[2]` is equal to `pd[1]` plus the integer value of the second character of the string `i`, `pd[3]` is equal to `pd[2]` plus the integer value of the third character of the string `i`, and so on until `pd[i]` is equal to `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the last character of the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]`, and the rest of the elements are zeros except `pd[i]` which is now equal to `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the last character of the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i`, `i` is a string with at least 1 character, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the first character of the string `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `pd[i]` has been updated by adding the integer value of the first character of the string `i` to its previous value. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
