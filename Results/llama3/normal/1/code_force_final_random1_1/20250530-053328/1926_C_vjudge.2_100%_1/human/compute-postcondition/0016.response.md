The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and i, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `i`. If `i` has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has at least 2 characters, `j` is the second character of the string `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `i` must have at least 3 characters and the `j` is the third character of the string `i`.
State: **`N` is greater than 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i`, `pd[2]` is equal to `pd[1]` plus the integer value of the second character of the string `i`, `pd[3]` is equal to `pd[2]` plus the integer value of the third character of the string `i`, and so on until `pd[i]` is equal to `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the last character of the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]`, and the rest of the elements are zeros except `pd[i]` which is now equal to `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the last character of the string `i` plus `pd[i-1]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i` plus the integer value of the second character of the string `i`, `i` is a string with at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the third character of the string `i`.**
