Output State: **`N` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` and the rest of the elements are zeros, `i` is 1, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1**

In this output state, the value of `pd[1]` has been updated to be equal to `pd[0]`, which is zero. The rest of the elements in the `pd` list remain unchanged. The values of `N`, `t`, `i`, and the input in stdin are not affected by the code.
