To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is a string with at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Since `i` is an integer, it needs to be converted to a string for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` and the rest of the elements are zeros, `i` is a string with at least 1 character, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the first character of the string `i`**
