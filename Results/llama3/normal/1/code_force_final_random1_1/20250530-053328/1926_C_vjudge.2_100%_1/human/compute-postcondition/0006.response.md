Output State: **`N` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i` and `pd[i]` is equal to `pd[i]` plus the integer value of the second character of the string `i` and the rest of the elements are zeros, `i` is a string with at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the second character of the string `i`**

In this output state, the value of `pd[i]` has been updated to include the integer value of the second character of the string `i`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `pd` now has two non-zero elements: `pd[1]` and `pd[i]`. The value of `pd[i]` is equal to its previous value plus the integer value of the second character of the string `i`.
