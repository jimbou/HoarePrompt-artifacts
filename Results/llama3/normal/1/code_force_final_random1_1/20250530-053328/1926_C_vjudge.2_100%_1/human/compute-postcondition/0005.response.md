To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for j in str(i):`, which means we are iterating over the characters of the string `i`. The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `N` is 200001
* `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4
* `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i` and the rest of the elements are zeros
* `i` is a string with at least 1 character
* `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers
* `N` is greater than 1
* `j` is the first character of the string `i`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when we move to the next character in the string `i`. The only variable that changes is `j`, which will now be the second character of the string `i`. The rest of the state remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`N` is 200001, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[1]` is equal to `pd[0]` plus the integer value of the first character of the string `i` and the rest of the elements are zeros, `i` is a string with at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `N` is greater than 1, `j` is the second character of the string `i`**

Note that we can only adjust the state of `j` and `i`, as they are the only variables in the loop head. The rest of the state remains the same.
