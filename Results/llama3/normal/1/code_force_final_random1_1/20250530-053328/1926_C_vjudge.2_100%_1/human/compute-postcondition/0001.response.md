The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If N is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, N is 200001, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, pd is a list of 200001 zeros does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `N` is greater than 1 and i is now 1. 
State: **stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, N is 200001, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, pd is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1,  `N` must be greater than 1**
