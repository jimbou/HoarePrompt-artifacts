Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur` equals to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 2, `ans` is a string containing the first three characters of `s`, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, if the bit at the position corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then the bit at the position corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1 and `cur` is incremented by 1 shifted to the left by `cur_ss` places.**
