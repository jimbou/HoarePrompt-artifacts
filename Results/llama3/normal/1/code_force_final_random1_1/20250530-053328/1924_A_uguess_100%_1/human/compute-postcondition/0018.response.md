Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least 3 characters, ss is the third character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the third character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If cur equals (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is 2, ans is the first two characters in the string s, and cur is 1 << cur_ss. Otherwise, cur remains 0. stdin contains t-1 test cases if cur equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cur_ss` has been updated to be the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet, which is calculated by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the third character `ss`. The other variables remain unchanged.
