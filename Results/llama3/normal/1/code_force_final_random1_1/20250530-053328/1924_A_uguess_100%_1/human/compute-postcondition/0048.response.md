According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `tmp` is an empty string. stdin contains `t-1` test cases, 'YES' is printed. So for the loop to be executed  the string `s` must have at least 1 character and `ss` is the first character in the string `s`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the first character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `tmp` is an empty string. stdin contains `t-1` test cases, 'YES' is printed.**
