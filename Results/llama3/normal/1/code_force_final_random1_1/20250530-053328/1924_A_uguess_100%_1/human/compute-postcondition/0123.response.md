Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is an integer plus 2, n is an integer, k is an integer and is greater than 0, m is an integer, s is an empty string, ss is an empty string, cur_ss is 0, cnt is the number of times the loop executed and is less than n, ans is a string containing all characters from s that were added to ans during the loop execution, tmp is a string containing the character 'a' plus i, cur is 0, and the string "NO" is being printed, i is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the character 'a' plus the value of i to the variable tmp. Since i is an integer plus 2, the value of tmp becomes the character 'a' plus i. The second line breaks the loop, but since the loop is not defined in the given code snippet, the impact of this line cannot be determined. However, based on the given information, the value of i is such that the bitwise AND operation between cur and 1 shifted left by i equals 0. This implies that i is 0. 

Therefore, the final output state includes all the variables from the initial state with their values updated according to the code execution. The value of tmp is updated to the character 'a' plus i, which is 'a' plus 0, making tmp equal to 'a'. The value of i is confirmed to be 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
