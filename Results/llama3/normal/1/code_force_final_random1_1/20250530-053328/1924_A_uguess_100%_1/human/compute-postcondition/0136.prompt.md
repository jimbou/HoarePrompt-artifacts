Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains three integers n (1 <= n <= 26), k (1 <= k <= 26), and m (1 <= m <= 1000), followed by a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    ans = ''
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
            ans += ss
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                break
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If cnt is greater than or equal to n, then if cur equals (1 << k) - 1, cnt is the number of iterations of the loop, ans is the string consisting of the characters in the string s that were added to ans in each iteration, and cur is 0. Otherwise, cnt is the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, ans is the string consisting of the characters in the string s that were added to ans in each iteration except the last one, and cur is 1 << cur_ss. stdin contains t-1 test cases if cur equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t test cases, and 'YES' is printed. If cnt is less than n, then if cur equals (1 << k) - 1, cnt is the number of iterations of the loop, ans is the string consisting of the characters in the string s that were added to ans in each iteration plus 'a' * (n - cnt - 1), and cur is 0. Otherwise, cnt is the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, ans is the string consisting of the characters in the string s that were added to ans in each iteration except the last one plus 'a' * (n - cnt - 1), and cur is 1 << cur_ss. tmp is an empty string. stdin contains t-1 test cases if cur equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t test cases. The number of iterations of the loop is less than n, 'NO' is printed, and ans is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is an integer plus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). cnt is an integer, ans is a string, tmp is an empty string, and cur is either 0 or (1 << k) - 1 or (1 << cur_ss) more than its previous value. If cur equals (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is incremented by 1 and ans is appended with the last character of the string s, and cur is set to 0. Otherwise, cur, cnt, and ans remain unchanged. If cur has a bit set at the position corresponding to the last character of the string s, then cur remains unchanged. Otherwise, cur is incremented by (1 << cur_ss). If cnt is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, i is incremented by k - 1, cnt is set to n - 1, ans is set to its original value plus tmp plus 'a' * (n - cnt - 1), and tmp is set to the character in the alphabet that is k - 1 positions ahead of 'a' if cur has no bit set at position k - 1, otherwise tmp is set to 'a', and ans is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed, `ans` is a string containing all characters from `s` that were added to `ans` during the loop execution, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `i` is set to `k`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string containing all characters from `s` that were added to `ans` during the loop execution plus `tmp` plus 'a' * (n - cnt - 1), and "NO" is printed along with the string `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
