To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust `k` to be greater than 0 and `i` to be 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur` equals (1 << `k`) - 1, then `cnt` is the number of iterations of the loop, `ans` is the string consisting of the characters in the string `s` that were added to `ans` in each iteration, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, `ans` is the string consisting of the characters in the string `s` that were added to `ans` in each iteration except the last one, and `cur` is 1 << `cur_ss`. `tmp` is an empty string. `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases if `cur` equals (1 << `k`) - 1, otherwise `stdin` contains `t` test cases. The number of iterations of the loop is less than `n`, and 'NO' is printed.**
