Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is an integer plus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). cnt is an integer, ans is a string, tmp is an empty string, and cur is either 0 or (1 << k) - 1 or (1 << cur_ss) more than its previous value. If cur equals (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is incremented by 1 and ans is appended with the last character of the string s, and cur is set to 0. Otherwise, cur, cnt, and ans remain unchanged. If cur has a bit set at the position corresponding to the last character of the string s, then cur remains unchanged. Otherwise, cur is incremented by (1 << cur_ss).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
- The string `s` must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop.
- `ss` is the last character in the string `s`.
- `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z').
- `cnt` is an integer that keeps track of the number of times `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`.
- `ans` is a string that stores the characters from `s` that cause `cur` to equal `(1 << k) - 1`.
- `cur` is either 0 or `(1 << k) - 1` or `(1 << cur_ss)` more than its previous value.
- If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is appended with the last character of the string `s`, and `cur` is set to 0.
- If `cur` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the last character of the string `s`, then `cur` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by `(1 << cur_ss)`.
