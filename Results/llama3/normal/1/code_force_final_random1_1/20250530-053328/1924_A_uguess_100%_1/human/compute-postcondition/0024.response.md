Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). The current value of cnt is greater than or equal to n. If cur equals (1 << k) - 1, then the current value of cnt is the number of iterations of the loop, ans is the string consisting of the characters in the string s that were added to ans in each iteration, and cur is 0. Otherwise, the current value of cnt is the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, ans is the string consisting of the characters in the string s that were added to ans in each iteration except the last one, and cur is 1 << cur_ss. stdin contains t-1 test cases if cur equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t test cases.**
