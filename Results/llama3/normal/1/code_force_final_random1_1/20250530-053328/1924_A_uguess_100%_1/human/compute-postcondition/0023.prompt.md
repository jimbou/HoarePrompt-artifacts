Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string, cnt is 0, cur is 0, ans is an empty string, stdin contains t-1 test cases
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, if cur equals (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is 1, ans is the first character in the string s, s is a string that must have at least 1 character, ss is the first character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive), cur is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least 2 characters, ss is the second character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the second character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If cur equals (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is 2, ans is the first two characters in the string s, and cur is 1 << cur_ss. Otherwise, cur remains 0. stdin contains t-1 test cases if cur equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least 3 characters, ss is the third character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the third character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If cur equals (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is 3, ans is the first three characters in the string s, and cur is 0. Otherwise, cnt is 1, ans is the first character in the string s plus the third character in the string s, and cur is 0. stdin contains t-1 test cases if cur equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
