Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is either an empty string or the second character of the string `s`, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is either 1 + (1 << cur_ss) or (1 << k) + (1 << cur_ss), and stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been updated to be either 1 plus the value of 1 shifted to the left by the position of the second character in the string `s` in the alphabet, or the value of 1 shifted to the left by `k` plus the value of 1 shifted to the left by the position of the second character in the string `s` in the alphabet. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
