Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 2, `ans` is the first two characters in the string `s`, and `cur` is `1 << cur_ss + 1`. Otherwise, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss + 1`. stdin contains `t-1` test cases if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise stdin contains `t` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, and `cur_ss` remains the same. The value of `cur` is incremented by `1 << cur_ss`. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 2, `ans` is the first two characters in the string `s`, and `cur` is now `1 << cur_ss + 1`. Otherwise, `cur` is now `1 << cur_ss + 1`. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same unless `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, in which case it decreases by 1.
