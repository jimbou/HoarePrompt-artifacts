The code prints the value of `ans`, which is a string containing all characters from `s` that were added to `ans` during the loop execution, plus `tmp`, plus 'a' * (n - cnt - 1).

Since `s` is an empty string, no characters were added to `ans` from `s`. The value of `tmp` depends on the condition `cur & 1 << i != 0`. If this condition is true, `tmp` is a string containing the character 'a' plus `i`. Otherwise, `tmp` is an empty string.

The expression 'a' * (n - cnt - 1) repeats the character 'a' a number of times equal to `n - cnt - 1`.

Therefore, the output will be a string containing the value of `tmp` (either 'a' plus `i` or an empty string) followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

Output: **tmp (which is either 'a' plus i or an empty string) plus 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)**
