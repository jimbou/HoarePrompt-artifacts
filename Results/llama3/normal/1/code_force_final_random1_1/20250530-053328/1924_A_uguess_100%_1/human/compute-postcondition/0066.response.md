Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is an integer plus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least 3 characters, ss is the third character in the string s, cur_ss is the position of the third character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), cnt is 1, ans is either the second character of the string s plus the third character of the string s or the third character of the string s, tmp is an empty string, and cur is 0.**

In this final state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `cur` has been reset to 0. The value of `ans` has been appended with the third character of the string `s`, which is `ss`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
