Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains three integers n (1 <= n <= 26), k (1 <= k <= 26), and m (1 <= m <= 1000), followed by a string s of length m, comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t test cases, each consisting of three integers and a string, as described in the initial state. The values of the other variables are not affected.
