Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed and is less than `n`, `ans` is a string containing all characters from `s` that were added to `ans` during the loop execution, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is 0, and the string "NO" is being printed.**

The code `tmp = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `tmp`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the exception that `tmp` is now an empty string.
