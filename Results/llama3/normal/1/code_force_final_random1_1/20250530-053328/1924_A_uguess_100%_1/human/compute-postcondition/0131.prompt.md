Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed and is less than `n`, `ans` is a string containing all characters from `s` that were added to `ans` during the loop execution, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is 0, and the string "NO" is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is an integer plus 2, n is an integer, k is an integer and is greater than 0, m is an integer, s is an empty string, ss is an empty string, cur_ss is 0, cnt is the number of times the loop executed and is less than n, ans is a string containing all characters from s that were added to ans during the loop execution, tmp is a string, cur is 0, and the string "NO" is being printed, i is 0. If the bitwise AND of cur and 1 shifted to the left by i is 0, then tmp is a string containing the character 'a' plus i.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer and is greater than 1, m is an integer, s is an empty string, ss is an empty string, cur_ss is 0, cnt is the number of times the loop executed and is less than n, ans is a string containing all characters from s that were added to ans during the loop execution, tmp is a string, cur is 0, and the string "NO" is being printed. If cur & 1 << i is not equal to 0, then tmp is 'b'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer and is greater than 2, m is an integer, s is an empty string, ss is an empty string, cur_ss is 0, cnt is the number of times the loop executed and is less than n, ans is a string containing all characters from s that were added to ans during the loop execution, and the string "NO" is being printed. If cur & 1 << i is not equal to 0, then tmp is 'b'. Otherwise, tmp is 'c'




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
