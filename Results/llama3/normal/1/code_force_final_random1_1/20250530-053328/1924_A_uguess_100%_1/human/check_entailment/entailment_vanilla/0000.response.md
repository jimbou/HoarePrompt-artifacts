Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of a given string s. If not, it also needs to print a string of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases t.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of n, k, and m, which represent the length of the strings to be formed, the number of lowercase English alphabets to use, and the length of the given string s, respectively.
3. It then reads the string s.
4. The program initializes a counter cnt to 0, a variable cur to 0, and an empty string ans.
5. It iterates over each character ss in the string s. For each character, it calculates the corresponding bit position in the binary representation of cur by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of ss.
6. If the bit at the calculated position in cur is 0, it sets the bit to 1 by adding 1 shifted left by the calculated position to cur.
7. If cur becomes equal to (1 << k) - 1, which represents the binary number with all bits set to 1 up to the k-th position, it increments the counter cnt by 1, resets cur to 0, and appends the current character ss to the string ans.
8. After iterating over the entire string s, if the counter cnt is greater than or equal to n, it prints 'YES', indicating that all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s.
9. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string tmp by finding the first bit position in cur that is 0, which corresponds to the first missing alphabet in the subsequence. It then appends this alphabet to the string ans, followed by 'a' repeated n - cnt - 1 times, to form a string of length n that does not occur as a subsequence of s.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
