Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed, `ans` is a string containing all characters from `s` that were added to `ans` during the loop execution, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, `i` is set to `k`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string containing all characters from `s` that were added to `ans` during the loop execution plus `tmp` plus 'a' * (n - cnt - 1), and "NO" is printed along with the string `ans`.**
