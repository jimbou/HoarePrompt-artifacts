Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed, `ans` is a string containing all characters from `s` that were added to `ans` during the loop execution, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged.
*   The string `s` becomes empty after all characters have been processed.
*   The variable `ss` holds the last character in the original string `s`.
*   The variable `cur_ss` holds the position of the last character in the original string `s` in the alphabet.
*   The variable `cnt` holds the total number of times the loop executed, which is equal to the length of the original string `s`.
*   The variable `ans` contains all characters from the original string `s` that were added to `ans` during the loop execution.
*   The variable `tmp` remains an empty string.
*   The variable `cur` is reset to 0 after the loop finishes executing.
