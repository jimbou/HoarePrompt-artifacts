Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the first character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is `1 << cur_ss` (i.e., `cur` has a bit set at the position corresponding to `cur_ss`).**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `cur`, which now has a bit set at the position corresponding to `cur_ss`, which is the position of the first character in the string `s` in the alphabet. This means that `cur` is now equal to `1 << cur_ss`, which is a power of 2 corresponding to the position of the first character in the string `s` in the alphabet.
