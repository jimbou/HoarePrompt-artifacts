Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is an integer plus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). cnt is 0, cur is 0, ans is an empty string, tmp is an empty string. stdin contains t-1 test cases, 'YES' is printed.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the first character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the first character of the string `s`, `tmp` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, the values of `cnt`, `ans`, `tmp`, and `cur` remain unchanged. In both cases, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is either an empty string or the second character of the string `s`, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is either 0 or (1 << k) - 1. If `cur` equals (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `ans` is set to the second character of the string `s`, and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is either an empty string or the second character of the string `s`, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is either 0 or (1 << k) - 1 or (1 << cur_ss) more than its previous value. If `cur` equals (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `ans` is set to the second character of the string `s`, and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged. If `cur` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the third character of the string `s`, then `cur` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by (1 << cur_ss).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
