To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ss` and `s`.

According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least one character. Since `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, we can adjust its state to be the first character in the string `s` for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the first character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is 0**
