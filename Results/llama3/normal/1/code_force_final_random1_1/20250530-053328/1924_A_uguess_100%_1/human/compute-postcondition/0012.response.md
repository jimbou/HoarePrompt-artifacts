Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, if cur equals (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is 1, ans is the first character in the string s, s is a string that must have at least 2 characters, ss is the second character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the second character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), cur is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable cur_ss has been updated to represent the position of the second character in the string s in the alphabet. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
