Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. The current value of `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, meaning all bits in `cur` are set to 1 up to the k-th position.**
