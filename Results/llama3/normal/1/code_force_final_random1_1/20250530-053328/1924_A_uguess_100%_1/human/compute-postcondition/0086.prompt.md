Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). `cnt` is an integer less than `n`, `ans` is a string, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is either 0 or (1 << `k`) - 1 or (1 << `cur_ss`) more than its previous value. If `cur` equals (1 << `k`) - 1, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is appended with the last character of the string `s`, and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged. If `cur` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the last character of the string `s`, then `cur` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by (1 << `cur_ss`), and 'NO' is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). `cnt` is an integer less than `n`, `ans` is a string, `tmp` is a string equal to 'a', and `cur` is either 0 or (1 << `k`) - 1 or (1 << `cur_ss`) more than its previous value. If `cur` equals (1 << `k`) - 1, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is appended with the last character of the string `s`, and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged. If `cur` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the last character of the string `s`, then `cur` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by (1 << `cur_ss`), and 'NO' is printed, and `i` is 0. If the current value of `cur` does not have a bit set at the position `i`, then `i` is 0 and `tmp` is a string equal to 'a'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). `cnt` is an integer less than `n`, `ans` is a string, and `tmp` is a string equal to 'a' if `cur` has no bit set at position `i`, otherwise `tmp` is a string equal to the character in the alphabet that is `i` positions ahead of 'a'. `cur` is either 0 or (1 << `k`) - 1 or (1 << `cur_ss`) more than its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than `i` + 1, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop plus 1, `ss` is the character in the string `s` that is one position ahead of the last character, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the character in the string `s` that is one position ahead of the last character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). `cnt` is an integer less than `n`, `ans` is a string, and `tmp` is a string equal to the character in the alphabet that is `i` + 1 positions ahead of 'a' if `cur` has no bit set at position `i` + 1, otherwise `tmp` is a string equal to 'a'. `cur` is either 0 or (1 << `k`) - 1 or (1 << `cur_ss`) more than its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
