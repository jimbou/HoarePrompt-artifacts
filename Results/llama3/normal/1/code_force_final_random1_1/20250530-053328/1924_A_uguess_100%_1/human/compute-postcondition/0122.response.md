Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is an empty string, `ss` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is 0, `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed and is less than `n`, `ans` is a string containing all characters from `s` that were added to `ans` during the loop execution, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is 0, and the string "NO" is being printed, `i` is 0. The current value of `i` is such that the bitwise AND operation between `cur` and 1 shifted left by `i` equals 0.***
