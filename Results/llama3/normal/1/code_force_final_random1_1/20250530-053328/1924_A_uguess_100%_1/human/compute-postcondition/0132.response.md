Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is k, n is an integer, k is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, s is an empty string, ss is an empty string, cur_ss is 0, cnt is the number of times the loop executed and is less than n, ans is a string containing all characters from s that were added to ans during the loop execution plus tmp plus 'a' * (n - cnt - 1), tmp is a string, cur is 0, and the string "NO" is being printed. If cur & 1 << i is not equal to 0, then tmp is a string containing the character 'a' plus i. Otherwise, tmp is an empty string.**

The code snippet modifies the value of `ans` by appending `tmp` and `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` to it. The value of `tmp` depends on the condition `cur & 1 << i != 0`. If this condition is true, `tmp` is a string containing the character 'a' plus `i`. Otherwise, `tmp` is an empty string. The value of `cnt` is not modified by the code snippet, so it remains the number of times the loop executed and is less than `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
