Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is an integer plus 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), cnt is 0, ans is an empty string, tmp is an empty string, and cur is 0.**

The code snippet provided assigns the values of `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input to their respective variables. It then assigns an empty string to `s`, and initializes `cnt`, `cur`, and `ans` to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `ss`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
