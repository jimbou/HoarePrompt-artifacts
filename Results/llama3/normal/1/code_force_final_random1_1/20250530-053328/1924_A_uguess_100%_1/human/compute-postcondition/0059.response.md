Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the second character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is either an empty string or the second character of the string `s`, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is either 0 or (1 << k) - 1. If `cur` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the second character of the string `s` in the alphabet, then `cur` is updated to either 1 + (1 << cur_ss) or (1 << k) + (1 << cur_ss). Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. stdin contains `t-1` test cases.***
