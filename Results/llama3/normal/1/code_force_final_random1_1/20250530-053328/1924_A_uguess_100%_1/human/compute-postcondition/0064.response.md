Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is either an empty string or the second character of the string `s`, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is either 0 or (1 << k) - 1 or (1 << cur_ss) more than its previous value. If `cur` equals (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `ans` is set to the second character of the string `s`, and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `cur` has been incremented by 2 to the power of `cur_ss`. If `cur` equals (1 << k) - 1 after this increment, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `ans` is set to the second character of the string `s`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the values of `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
