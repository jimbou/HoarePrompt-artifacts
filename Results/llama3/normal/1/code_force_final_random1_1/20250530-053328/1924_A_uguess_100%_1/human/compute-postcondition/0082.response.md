Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). `cnt` is an integer less than `n`, `ans` is a string, and `tmp` is a string equal to 'a' if `cur` has no bit set at position `i`, otherwise `tmp` is a string equal to the character in the alphabet that is `i` positions ahead of 'a'. `cur` is either 0 or (1 << `k`) - 1 or (1 << `cur_ss`) more than its previous value.**
