You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is an integer plus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). cnt is an integer, ans is a string, tmp is an empty string, and cur is either 0 or (1 << k) - 1 or (1 << cur_ss) more than its previous value. If cur equals (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is incremented by 1 and ans is appended with the last character of the string s, and cur is set to 0. Otherwise, cur, cnt, and ans remain unchanged. If cur has a bit set at the position corresponding to the last character of the string s, then cur remains unchanged. Otherwise, cur is incremented by (1 << cur_ss). If cnt is greater than or equal to n, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, i is incremented by k - 1, cnt is set to n - 1, ans is set to its original value plus tmp plus 'a' * (n - cnt - 1), and tmp is set to the character in the alphabet that is k - 1 positions ahead of 'a' if cur has no bit set at position k - 1, otherwise tmp is set to 'a', and ans is printed.
```
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
