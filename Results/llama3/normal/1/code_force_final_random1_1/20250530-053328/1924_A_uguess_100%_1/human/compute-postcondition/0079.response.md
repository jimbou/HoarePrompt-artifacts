Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, `ss` is the last character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). `cnt` is an integer less than `n`, `ans` is a string, `tmp` is a string equal to 'a', and `cur` is either 0 or (1 << `k`) - 1 or (1 << `cur_ss`) more than its previous value. If `cur` equals (1 << `k`) - 1, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is appended with the last character of the string `s`, and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged. If `cur` has a bit set at the position corresponding to the last character of the string `s`, then `cur` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by (1 << `cur_ss`), and 'NO' is printed, and `i` is 0. If the current value of `cur` does not have a bit set at the position `i`, then `i` is 0 and `tmp` is a string equal to 'a'.**
