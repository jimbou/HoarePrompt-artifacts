Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is an integer where the bit at position `cur_ss` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The code increments the value of `cur` by shifting 1 to the left by `cur_ss` places, effectively setting the bit at position `cur_ss` to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
