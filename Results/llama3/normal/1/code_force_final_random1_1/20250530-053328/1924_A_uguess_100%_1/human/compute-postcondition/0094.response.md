Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the first character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `cur_ss` has been updated to be the position of the first character in the string `s` in the alphabet, which is calculated by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the first character in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
