Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 3, n is an integer, k must be greater than 2, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If cur equals (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is the number of iterations of the loop, ans is the string consisting of the characters in the string s that were added to ans in each iteration, and cur is 0. Otherwise, cnt is the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, ans is the string consisting of the characters in the string s that were added to ans in each iteration except the last one, and cur is 1 << cur_ss. tmp is a string containing a single character which is the character at position i in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z') if the current value of cur is not equal to 1 shifted left by i, otherwise tmp is an empty string. stdin contains t-1 test cases if cur equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t test cases. The number of iterations of the loop is less than n, and 'NO' is printed. If cur & 1 << i equals 0, then tmp is a string containing a single character which is the character at position i in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). Otherwise, tmp is an empty string.**

The code modifies the value of `i` by incrementing it by 1, making it 3. The value of `tmp` is reassigned to a string containing a single character, which is the character at position `i` in the alphabet. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
