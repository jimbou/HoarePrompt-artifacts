The only object in the loop head is variable  ss and string s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s.  If the string has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, s has at least 2 characters, ss is the second character in the string s. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 3 characters and the ss is the third character in the string s.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the third character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur` equals to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 2, `ans` is a string containing the first three characters of `s`, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, the bit at the position corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1.**
