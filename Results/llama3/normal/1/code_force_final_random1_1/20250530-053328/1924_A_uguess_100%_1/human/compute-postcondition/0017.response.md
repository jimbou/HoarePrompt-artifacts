The only object in the loop head is variable  ss and string  s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s.  If the string has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, s has at least 2 characters, ss is the second character in the string s. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 3 characters and the ss is the third character in the string.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least 3 characters, ss is the third character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the third character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If cur equals (1 << k) - 1, then cnt is 2, ans is the first two characters in the string s, and cur is 1 << cur_ss. Otherwise, cur remains 0. stdin contains t-1 test cases if cur equals (1 << k) - 1, otherwise stdin contains t test cases.**
