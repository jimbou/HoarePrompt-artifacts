The only object in the loop head is variable  ss, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 1 character, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `s` must have at least 2 characters and the `ss` is the second character in the string `s`. Since `cur_ss` is the position of the first character in the string `s` in the alphabet, it must be updated to be the position of the second character in the string `s` in the alphabet. 

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is an integer plus 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the second character in the string `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur` equals to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `s`, `tmp` is an empty string, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to have a bit set at the position corresponding to `cur_ss` if the bit at the position corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0.**
