Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is k, n is an integer, k is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, s is an empty string, ss is an empty string, cur_ss is 0, cnt is the number of times the loop executed and is less than n, ans is a string containing all characters from s that were added to ans during the loop execution, tmp is a string, cur is 0, and the string "NO" is being printed. If cur & 1 << i is not equal to 0, then tmp is a string containing the character 'a' plus i. Otherwise, tmp is an empty string.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `t` remains an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
*   The value of `i` is equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has executed `k` times.
*   The value of `n` remains an integer.
*   The value of `k` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, indicating that the loop has executed at least 0 times.
*   The value of `m` remains an integer.
*   The value of `s` remains an empty string.
*   The value of `ss` remains an empty string.
*   The value of `cur_ss` remains 0.
*   The value of `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed and is less than `n`.
*   The value of `ans` is a string containing all characters from `s` that were added to `ans` during the loop execution.
*   The value of `tmp` is a string.
*   The value of `cur` is 0.
*   The string "NO" is being printed.
*   If `cur & 1 << i` is not equal to 0, then `tmp` is a string containing the character 'a' plus `i`. Otherwise, `tmp` is an empty string.
