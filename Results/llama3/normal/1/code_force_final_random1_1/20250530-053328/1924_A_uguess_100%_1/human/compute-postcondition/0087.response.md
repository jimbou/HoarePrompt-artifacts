Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is an integer plus k - 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, m is an integer, s is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop minus 1, ss is the last character in the string s, cur_ss is an integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive) and equals to the position of the last character in the string s in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), cnt is an integer equal to n - 1, ans is a string equal to its original value plus tmp plus 'a' * (n - cnt - 1), and tmp is a string equal to the character in the alphabet that is k - 1 positions ahead of 'a' if cur has no bit set at position k - 1, otherwise tmp is a string equal to 'a'. cur is either 0 or (1 << k) - 1 or (1 << cur_ss) more than its previous value.**

The first line appends the value of `tmp` to `ans`. Since `tmp` is either the character in the alphabet that is `k` - 1 positions ahead of 'a' if `cur` has no bit set at position `k` - 1, or 'a' otherwise, `ans` now contains this character appended to its original value. The second line appends `n - cnt - 1` 'a's to `ans`. Since `cnt` is an integer less than `n`, `n - cnt - 1` is a non-negative integer, and `ans` now contains these 'a's appended to its previous value. The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, making it equal to `n - 1`. No other variables are affected.
