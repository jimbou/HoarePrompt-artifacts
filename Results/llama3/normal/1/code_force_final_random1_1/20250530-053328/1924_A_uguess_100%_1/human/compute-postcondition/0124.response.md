Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), i is an integer plus 2, n is an integer, k is an integer and is greater than 0, m is an integer, s is an empty string, ss is an empty string, cur_ss is 0, cnt is the number of times the loop executed and is less than n, ans is a string containing all characters from s that were added to ans during the loop execution, tmp is a string, cur is 0, and the string "NO" is being printed, i is 0. If the bitwise AND of cur and 1 shifted to the left by i is 0, then tmp is a string containing the character 'a' plus i.***
