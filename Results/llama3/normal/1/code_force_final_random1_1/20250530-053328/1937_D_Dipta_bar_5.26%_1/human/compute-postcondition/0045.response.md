Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`. `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list with at least one element and `i` is appended to it, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. If `idx_B` is empty, then `B` is a list with one element which is 0 and `idx_B` is an empty list. Otherwise, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`.**
