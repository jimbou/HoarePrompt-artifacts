The code prints the value of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where `a` is an element of list `A`, `b` is an expression involving elements of list `idx_B`, `i` is an integer with a value of 2.

Since the exact values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + 3 (where a is an element of list A, b is an expression involving elements of list idx_B)**
