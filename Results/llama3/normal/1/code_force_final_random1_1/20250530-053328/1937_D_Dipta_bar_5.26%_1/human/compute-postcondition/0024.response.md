To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, which means `n` is already at least 1. However, we need to adjust the state of `j` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0**
