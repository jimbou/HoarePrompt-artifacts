The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '<' in `s`, `j` is `n - 1`, `i` is 1.**
