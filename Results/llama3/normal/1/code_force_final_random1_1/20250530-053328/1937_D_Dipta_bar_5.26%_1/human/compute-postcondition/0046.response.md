Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`. `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`. `idx_B` is a list with elements `i` and `n - 3`, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`.**

In this output state, the value of `idx_B` has been updated by appending the current value of `i`, which is `n - 3`, to the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
