Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 0, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, B is a list with elements x, where x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), idx_B is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '<' in s, j is n - 1, i is 0, l is equal to r, r is the length of B and is larger than 0, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1].**

In this final state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated based on the given formulas, using the current values of `B`, `idx_B`, `A`, `l`, `r`, and `i`. The rest of the variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
