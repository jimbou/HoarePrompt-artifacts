The code prints a value calculated based on the elements of lists `A` and `B`, and the variables `i`, `a`, `b`, and `x`. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the variables and their values:

- `a` is an element of list `A`, which is calculated as `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`. Since `i` is `1`, `a` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (1 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`.

- `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Since `i` is `1`, `b` is equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)`.

- `i` is given as `1`.

- The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is calculated by multiplying `a` and `b` by `2`, adding `i` and `1`, and then printing the result.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is an element of list A, b is calculated based on idx_B and i, and i is 1)**
