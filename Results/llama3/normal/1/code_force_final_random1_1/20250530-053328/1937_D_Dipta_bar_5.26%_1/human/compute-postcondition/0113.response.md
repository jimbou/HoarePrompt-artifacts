Based on the initial state, let's break down the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `n` is the length of the string `s`, which is greater than 1.
* `i` is equal to 1.

The print statement is `print(n - i, end=' ')`.

Since `i` is 1, we can substitute this value into the expression `n - i`. This gives us `n - 1`.

The `end=' '` argument in the print statement means that a space will be printed after the value of `n - 1`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `n - 1`, followed by a space.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is the length of the string s), followed by a space**
