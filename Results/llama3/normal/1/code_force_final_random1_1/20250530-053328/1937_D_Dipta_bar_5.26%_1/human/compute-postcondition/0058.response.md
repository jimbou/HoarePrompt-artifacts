Based on the precondition, let's break down the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `a` is `A[0]`, which is the first element of list `A`. Since `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, we can't determine the exact value of `a` without knowing the values of `idx_A` and `A[len(A) - 2]`. However, we can describe `a` as the first element of list `A`, which is calculated based on the indices of '>' characters in string `s`.
* `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Since `idx_B` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '<' in `s`, `idx_B[r - 1]` is the last index of '<' in `s`. `i` is 0, and `l` is 0, so `b` is equal to `idx_B[r - 1]`.
* `i` is 0.
* `j` is `n - 1`, but it's not used in the print statement.
* `l` is 0, but it's not used in the print statement.
* `r` is the length of `B`, but it's not used in the print statement.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')`

The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` can be broken down as follows:

* `a * 2` is twice the first element of list `A`, which is calculated based on the indices of '>' characters in string `s`.
* `b * 2` is twice the last index of '<' in `s`.
* `i + 1` is 1, since `i` is 0.

Therefore, the print statement will output the sum of twice the first element of list `A`, twice the last index of '<' in `s`, and 1.

Output: **2 * (the first element of list A) + 2 * (the last index of '<' in s) + 1**
