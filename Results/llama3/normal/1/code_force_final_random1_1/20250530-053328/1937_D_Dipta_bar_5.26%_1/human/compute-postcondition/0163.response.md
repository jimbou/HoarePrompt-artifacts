Output State: **The value of `l` is increased by 1. The string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>' is still valid, where `n` is greater than 2. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is `n`. If `s[i]` is '<', then if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 1, the value of `i + 1` which is 3 is being printed. Otherwise, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l < 0`. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` equals 0, then this is printed: `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`. Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`. If `r` is not equal to 0, then `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`. If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` (where `a` is `A[l]`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and `i` is 2).**

In natural language, the code increments the value of `l` by 1, and the rest of the conditions and variables remain the same as in the initial state. The program still prints a value based on the string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', where `n` is greater than 2.
