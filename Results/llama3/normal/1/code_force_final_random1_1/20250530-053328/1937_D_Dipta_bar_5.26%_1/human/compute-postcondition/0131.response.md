The code prints the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where `a` and `b` are calculated based on the lists `A` and `B`, respectively, and the index `i`.

The value of `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, where `l` is the length of the list `idx_A`. Since `i` is 1 and `idx_A` contains the indices of the character '>' in the string `s`, `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the last '>' character in `s`. Therefore, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.

The value of `b` is calculated differently depending on the value of `r - l`. If `r - l < 0`, then `b` is equal to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Since `r` is `n - 2` and `l` is the length of the list `idx_A`, which is equal to the number of '>' characters in `s`, `r - l` is less than 0 if and only if there are more '<' characters than '>' characters in `s`. Therefore, if there are more '<' characters than '>' characters in `s`, `b` is equal to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

The value of `i` is 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where `a` and `b` are calculated based on the lists `A` and `B`, respectively, and the index `i`.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l if r - l < 0, otherwise b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l, and i is 1)**
