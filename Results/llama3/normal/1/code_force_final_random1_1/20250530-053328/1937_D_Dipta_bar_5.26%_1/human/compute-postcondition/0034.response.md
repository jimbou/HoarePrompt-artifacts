State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`. If `s[i]` is '<', then `B` is a list with elements `x`, where either `x` is 0 if `idx_B` is empty, or `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with at least one element. Otherwise, `B` is an empty list and `idx_B` is an empty list. `j` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`.**
