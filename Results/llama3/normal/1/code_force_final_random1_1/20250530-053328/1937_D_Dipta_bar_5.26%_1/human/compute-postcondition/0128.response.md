Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 1, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, B is a list with elements x, where x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), idx_B is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '<' in s, j is n - 1, i is 1, r is n - 2, a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)**

In this final state, the variables `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `j`, `i`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged. The only variable affected by the code is `b`, which is updated in two steps. First, `b` is decremented by the value of `B[r - l]`, and then it is further decremented by the product of `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` and `(r - l)`. The resulting value of `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`.
