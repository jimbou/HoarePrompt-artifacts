Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is a list and is not empty, and its last element is 0, and `A` is a list with an additional element 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` remains the same, the length of the string `n` is still greater than 1, the index `i` is still 1, the list `idx_A` is still not empty and its last element is 0, and the list `A` has been appended with a new element 0.
