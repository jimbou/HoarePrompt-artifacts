Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`. `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list with at least two elements and `i` is appended to it, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. Otherwise, `B` is a list with one element which is 0 and `idx_B` is an empty list. `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `B` now has one element which is 0, and the list `idx_B` is still empty. The other variables remain unchanged.
