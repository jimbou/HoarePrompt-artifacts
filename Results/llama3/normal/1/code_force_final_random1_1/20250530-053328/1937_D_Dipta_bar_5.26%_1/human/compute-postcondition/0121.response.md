Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '<' in `s`, `j` is `n - 1`, `i` is 1. If `r` is 0, the value of `n - i` which is equal to `n - 1` is being printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`***
