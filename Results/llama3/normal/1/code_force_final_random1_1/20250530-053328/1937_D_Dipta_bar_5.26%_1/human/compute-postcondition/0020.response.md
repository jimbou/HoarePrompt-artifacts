Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `idx_A` is a list with an additional element 2, and if `idx_A` is empty, `A` is a list containing the integer 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x` which is equal to the last element of `A` plus `(2 - the last element of idx_A)` times the length of `idx_A`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 2. The list `idx_A` now contains an additional element, which is 2. The list `A` is updated based on the new value of `idx_A`. If `idx_A` was initially empty, `A` still contains only the integer 0. Otherwise, `A` has a new element `x`, which is calculated by adding `(2 - the last element of idx_A)` times the length of `idx_A` to the last element of `A`.
