Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where either `x` is 0 if `idx_B` is empty, or `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with at least one element, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` has a length of `n` and consists of '<' and '>' characters. The value of `n` is still equal to the length of `s`. The list `A` remains unchanged, with its elements calculated based on the indices of '>' characters in `s`. The list `idx_A` also remains unchanged, containing the indices of '>' characters in `s`. The list `B` still has elements calculated based on the indices of '<' characters in `s`, but now `idx_B` has at least one element, which is the index `i` that was just appended. The values of `j` and `i` remain unchanged, with `j` being 0 and `i` being `n - 1`.
