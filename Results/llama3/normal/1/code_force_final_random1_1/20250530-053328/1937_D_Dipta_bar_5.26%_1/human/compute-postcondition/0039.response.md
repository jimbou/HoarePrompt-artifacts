Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`. `idx_B` is a list with at least one element and `i` is appended to it, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `j` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `idx_B` has been updated by appending the current value of `i` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `B` is updated according to the new value of `idx_B`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and relationships.
