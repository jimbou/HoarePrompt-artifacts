Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is a list with one element 0, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`. The current value of `s[i]` is '<'.**

In this output state, the list `B` now contains one element, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `idx_B` is still empty, and the values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `j`, and `i` are the same as in the initial state.
