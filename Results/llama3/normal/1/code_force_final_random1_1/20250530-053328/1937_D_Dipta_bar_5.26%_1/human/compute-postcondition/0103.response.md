Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '<' in `s`, `j` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` in `s` is '<'. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the value 1 is printed. Otherwise, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is equal to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. The value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is being printed. If `l` is larger than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the program prints `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. If `r` is not 0, `a` is equal to the second last element of `B`, `b` is equal to the second last element of `A` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` is equal to the second last element of `A`, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and the program prints `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.***
