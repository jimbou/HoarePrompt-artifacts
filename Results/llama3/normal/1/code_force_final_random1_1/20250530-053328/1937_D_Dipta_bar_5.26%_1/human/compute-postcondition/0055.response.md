Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 0, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, B is a list with elements x, where x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), idx_B is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '<' in s, j is n - 1, i is 0, l is 0, r is the length of B, a is A[0], x is r - 2, b is B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1).**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The string `s` remains unchanged with a length of `n` greater than 0, consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The lists `A` and `idx_A` also remain unchanged, with `A` containing elements `x` calculated based on the indices of '>' in `s`, and `idx_A` containing the indices of '>' in `s`. Similarly, lists `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged, with `B` containing elements `x` calculated based on the indices of '<' in `s`, and `idx_B` containing the indices of '<' in `s`. The variables `j`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `a`, and `x` also retain their initial values. However, the value of `b` is updated by subtracting the value of `B[x]` and the product of `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1])` and `(x + 1)` from its initial value `B[r - 1]`.
