Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s and is greater than 0, A is a list with an additional element x, idx_A is a list and is not empty, i is 0, and the current value of s[i] is '>', x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)**

In this output state, the string s and its length n remain unchanged. The list A has been modified by appending a new element x, which is calculated based on the last element of A, the difference between the current index i and the last element of idx_A, and the length of idx_A. The list idx_A remains unchanged, and the index i remains at 0. The value of s[i] is still '>'. The new element x is added to the end of list A.
