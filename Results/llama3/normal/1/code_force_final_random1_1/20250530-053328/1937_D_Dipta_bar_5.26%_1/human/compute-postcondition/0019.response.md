Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `idx_A` is empty, `A` is a list containing the integer 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x` which is equal to the last element of `A` plus `(i - the last element of idx_A)` times the length of `idx_A`, and `idx_A` remains unchanged.***
