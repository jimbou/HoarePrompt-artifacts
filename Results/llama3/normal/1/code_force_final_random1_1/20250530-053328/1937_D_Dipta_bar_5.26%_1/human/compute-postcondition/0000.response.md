Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list**

The code assigns the length of string s to variable n, which is already known to be a positive integer. It then initializes two empty lists, A and idx_A. The values of s and n remain unchanged, as they are only used to determine the value of n and are not modified by the code. The lists A and idx_A are new variables introduced by the code, and they are empty.
