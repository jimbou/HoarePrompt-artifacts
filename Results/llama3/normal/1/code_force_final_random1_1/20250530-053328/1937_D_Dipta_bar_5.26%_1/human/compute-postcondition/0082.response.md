Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '<' in `s`, `j` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` in `s` is '<', `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is equal to `B[r]`.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `a` and `b` based on the existing values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `r`. The first line assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to `a`, and the second line increments `a` by `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. The third line assigns the value of `B[r]` to `b`. The values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.
