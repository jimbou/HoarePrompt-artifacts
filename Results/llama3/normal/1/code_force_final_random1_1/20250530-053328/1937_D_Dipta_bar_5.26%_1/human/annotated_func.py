    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the program has printed a series of values based on the string `s` and the lists `A` and `B`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `i` have been updated accordingly. The final values of `l`, `r`, and `i` are `n`, 0, and `n` respectively. The program has printed a total of `n` values, each calculated based on the elements of `A` and `B` and their indices. The state of the other variables in the precondition, including `s`, `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, and `j`, remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and prints a series of values based on the string and the calculated lists `A` and `B`. The function iterates through the string, updating the values of `l`, `r`, and `i` accordingly, and prints a total of `n` values, each calculated based on the elements of `A` and `B` and their indices. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated values to the console.
