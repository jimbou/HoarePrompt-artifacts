This function takes a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and prints a series of values based on the string and the calculated lists `A` and `B`. The function iterates through the string, updating the values of `l`, `r`, and `i` accordingly, and prints a total of `n` values, each calculated based on the elements of `A` and `B` and their indices. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated values to the console.
