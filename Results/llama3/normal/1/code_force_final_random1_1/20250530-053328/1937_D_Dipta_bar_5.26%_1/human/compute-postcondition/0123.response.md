Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '<' in `s`, `j` is `n - 1`, `i` is 1, `l` is `n - 1 + 1` which is equal to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still has the same length `n` and consists of the same characters '<' and '>'. The lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is still `n - 1`, and the value of `i` is still 1. However, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to `n`.
