Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `A` is a list containing one element which is 0, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '>', and the length of `idx_A` is 0**

In this output state, the list `A` now contains one element, which is 0, as a result of the append operation. The other variables remain unchanged, with `s` still being a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` being a positive integer equal to the length of `s` and greater than 0, `idx_A` being an empty list, `i` being 0, and the current value of `s[i]` being '>'. The length of `idx_A` is still 0.
