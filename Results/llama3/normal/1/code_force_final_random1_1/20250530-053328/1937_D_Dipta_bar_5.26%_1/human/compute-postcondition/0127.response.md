Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 1, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, B is a list with elements x, where x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), idx_B is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '<' in s, j is n - 1, i is 1, r is n - 2, a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is B[r].**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated based on the calculations performed in the code. The value of `a` is now equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, where `l` is the length of the list `A`. The value of `b` is now equal to `B[r]`, where `r` is `n - 2`. The other variables, including `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `j`, `i`, and `r`, remain unchanged.
