Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 2, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, B is a list with elements x, where x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), idx_B is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '<' in s, j is n - 1, i is 2, r is r - 1, a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is B[r].**

In this final state, the variables s, n, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, j, i, and r retain their initial values. The variable a is updated to be the value of A[l - 1] plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) times l. The variable b is updated to be the value of B[r]. The variables l and r are not explicitly updated in the code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.
