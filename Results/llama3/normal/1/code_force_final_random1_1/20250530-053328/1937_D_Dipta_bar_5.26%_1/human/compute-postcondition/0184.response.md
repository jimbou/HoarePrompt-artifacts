Postcondition: **The program prints a value based on the string `s` and the lists `A` and `B`. If `s[i]` is '>', then the value of `l` is increased by 1. If `s[i]` is '<', then if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the program calculates `a` and `b` based on the elements of `A` and `B` and their indices, and prints `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the program calculates `a` and `b` based on the elements of `B` and `A` and their indices, and prints `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`. In all cases, the program updates the values of `r` and `i` accordingly.**
