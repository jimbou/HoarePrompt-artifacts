Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` is a list and its last element is 1, and if `idx_A` is empty, `A` is a list with an additional element 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with two additional elements `x` and `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`. If the current value of `s[i]` is not '>', the state of the program remains unchanged.***
