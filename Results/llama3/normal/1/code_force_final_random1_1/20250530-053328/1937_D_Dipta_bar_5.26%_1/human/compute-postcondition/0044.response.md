Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, idx_B is a list with at least one element and i is appended to it, B is a list with elements x, where x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), j is 2, i is n - 3, x is B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B).**

The code block calculates a new value `x` based on the last element of list `B`, the last index in list `idx_B`, the current index `i`, and the length of list `idx_B`. This new value `x` is then appended to list `B`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
