Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, B is a list with elements x, where x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), idx_B is a list with at least one element, j is 0, i is n - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The list `A` and its elements `x` are not modified by the code, so their values remain the same. The list `idx_A` and its elements `i` are also not modified, so their values remain the same. The list `B` is modified by the code, with a new element `x` appended to it. The value of `x` is calculated based on the last element of `B`, the last element of `idx_B`, and the current value of `i`. The list `idx_B` is not modified by the code, so its elements remain the same. The value of `j` remains 0 as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains `n - 1` as it is not modified by the code.
