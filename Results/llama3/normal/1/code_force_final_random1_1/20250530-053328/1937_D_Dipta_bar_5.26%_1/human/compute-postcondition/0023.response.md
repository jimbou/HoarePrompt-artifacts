Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list.**

The code initializes two empty lists, B and idx_B, but does not modify any existing variables or their values. The initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the new empty lists B and idx_B.
