Output: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 2, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, B is a list with elements x, where x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), idx_B is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '<' in s, j is n - 1, i is 2, if r - l >= 0, then r is r - 1 and b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l), b is b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l, and this is printed: a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1**
