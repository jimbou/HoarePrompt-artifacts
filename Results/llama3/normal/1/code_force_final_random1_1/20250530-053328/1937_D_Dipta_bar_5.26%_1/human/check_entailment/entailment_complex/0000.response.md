Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules of the pinball movement and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program first initializes two lists, A and B, to store the cumulative sums of the indices of the '>' and '<' characters in the string s, respectively. It also initializes two lists, idx_A and idx_B, to store the indices of the '>' and '<' characters in s, respectively.

The program then iterates through the string s, updating the values of l, r, and i accordingly. For each character in s, it calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the elements of A and B and their indices. The program prints the calculated values to the console.

The program correctly handles the cases where the pinball moves to the left or right, and it correctly updates the values of l, r, and i accordingly. The program also correctly calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
