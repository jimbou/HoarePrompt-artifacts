Output: ** `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '<' in `s`, `j` is `n - 1`, `i` is 2, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, `l` is either `n` if `s[i]` is '>', or `l` is less than or equal to `r` if `s[i]` is '<', `r` is either 0 if `l` is greater than `r` and `r` equals 0, or `r` is greater than 0 if `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` (where `a` is `A[l]`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and `i` is 2)**
