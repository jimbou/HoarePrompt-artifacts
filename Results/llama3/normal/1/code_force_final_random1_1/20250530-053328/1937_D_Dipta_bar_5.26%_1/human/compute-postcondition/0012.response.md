Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s and is greater than 1, i is 1, idx_A is a list and is not empty, and its last element is 0, and A is a list with two additional elements x and A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A), where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A).**

The code block modifies the list A by appending a new element x, which is calculated based on the last element of A, the last element of idx_A, and the length of idx_A. The value of x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A). The code also appends another element to A, which is equal to A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A). The values of s, n, and i remain unchanged. The list idx_A remains not empty and its last element remains 0.
