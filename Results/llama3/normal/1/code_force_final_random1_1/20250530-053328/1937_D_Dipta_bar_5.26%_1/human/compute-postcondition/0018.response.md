Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s and is greater than 2, i is 2, A is a list with an additional element x which is equal to the last element of A plus (i - the last element of idx_A) times the length of idx_A, idx_A is unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `s` and `n` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `A` has an additional element `x` which is calculated based on the last element of `A`, the value of `i`, the last element of `idx_A`, and the length of `idx_A`. The list `idx_A` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
