Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 1, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, B is a list with elements x, where x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), idx_B is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '<' in s, j is n - 1, i is 1, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1].**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to variables `a` and `b`. The first line calculates the value of `a` based on the elements of list `B`, the index `r`, and the value of `i`. The second line assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to `b`. The rest of the variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
