Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the string `s` remains unchanged, the list `A` contains elements that are calculated based on the indices of the character '>' in `s`, and the list `idx_A` contains the indices of the character '>' in `s`. The length of `A` and `idx_A` is equal to the number of '>' characters in `s`. The elements of `A` are calculated by adding the difference between the current index `i` and the last index of '>' in `idx_A` multiplied by the length of `idx_A` to the last element of `A`. The elements of `idx_A` are the indices of the character '>' in `s`.
