The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '<' in `s`, `j` is `n - 1`, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is `n - 1 + 1` which is equal to `n`. If `s[i]` is '<', then if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the value of `i + 1` which is 3 is being printed. Otherwise, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l < 0`. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` equals 0, then this is printed: `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`. Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`
