Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, B is a list with elements x, where x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), idx_B is a list with at least one element, j is 1, i is n - 2, x is B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)**

In this final state, the code has appended a new element to list B, which is equal to the last element of B plus the difference between the last index of B and the current index i, multiplied by the length of idx_B. The value of x is also updated to this new value. All other variables remain unchanged.
