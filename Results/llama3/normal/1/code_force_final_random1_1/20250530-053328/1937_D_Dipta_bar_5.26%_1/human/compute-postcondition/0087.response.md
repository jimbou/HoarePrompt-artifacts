The code prints the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is equal to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is less than 0, or `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, and `l` is the length of `idx_A` (or `idx_B`).

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l if r - l is less than 0, or B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l if r - l is greater than or equal to 0, i is 0, and l is the length of idx_A (or idx_B))**
