Based on the precondition, we can break down the values of the variables and objects as follows:

* `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
* `n` is greater than 1.
* `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`. This means that each element in `A` is calculated based on the previous element and the index of the '>' character in `s`.
* `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`.
* `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. This means that each element in `B` is calculated based on the previous element and the index of the '<' character in `s`.
* `idx_B` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '<' in `s`.
* `j` is `n - 1`.
* `i` is 1.
* `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. This means that `a` is calculated based on the previous element in `B` and the index of the '<' character in `s`.
* `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. This means that `b` is calculated based on the previous elements in `A` and the index of the '>' character in `s`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')`

* `a * 2` will print the value of `a` multiplied by 2.
* `b * 2` will print the value of `b` multiplied by 2.
* `(n - i)` will print the value of `n` minus the value of `i`, which is `n - 1`.

Since we don't have the exact values of `a` and `b`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of the expression.

Output: **(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - 1)) (where a is the value of a, b is the value of b, and n is the length of the string s)**
