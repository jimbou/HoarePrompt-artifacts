Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '<' in `s`, `j` is `n - 1`, `i` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`. Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still has a length of `n` and consists of '<' and '>' characters. The lists `A` and `B` still have the same structure, with elements calculated based on the indices of '>' and '<' characters in `s`. The variables `j`, `i`, and `r` still have the same values. The variable `a` is still equal to `B[r]`. The variable `b` has been updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise it is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
