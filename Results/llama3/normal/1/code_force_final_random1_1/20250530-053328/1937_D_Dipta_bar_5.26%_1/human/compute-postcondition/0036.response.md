Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`. `B` is a list with elements `x`, where either `x` is 0 if `idx_B` is empty, or `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with at least one element and one more element 0 is appended to `B`, `j` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` has a length of `n` and consists of '<' and '>' characters. The value of `n` is still a positive integer and is equal to the length of `s`. The list `A` remains unchanged, with elements calculated based on the indices of '>' characters in `s`. The list `B` now has an additional element, 0, appended to it. The list `idx_B` still has at least one element. The values of `j` and `i` remain unchanged, with `j` being 1 and `i` being `n - 2`.
