Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 1, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, B is a list with elements x, where x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), idx_B is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '<' in s, j is n - 1, i is 1, a is A[l], x is r - (l + 2), b is B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1).**

The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `B[x]` and `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from it. The value of `x` is used to index into the list `B` and `idx_B`. The value of `r` is used to calculate the index `x`. The value of `l` is used to calculate the value of `a`. The value of `i` is used to calculate the value of `a`. The value of `j` is not modified. The lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` are not modified. The string `s` and the value of `n` are not modified.
