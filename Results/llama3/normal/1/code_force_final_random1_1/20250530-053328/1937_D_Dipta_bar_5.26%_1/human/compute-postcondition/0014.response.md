Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is a list and its last element is 1, and if `idx_A` is empty, `A` is a list with an additional element 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with two additional elements `x` and `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` remains unchanged, the length of the string `n` is still greater than 1, the value of `i` is still 1, and the list `idx_A` now has an additional element which is 1. The list `A` has two additional elements, one of which is `x` and the other is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of the difference between `i` and the second last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`. The value of `x` is the sum of the second last element of `A` and the product of the difference between `i` and the second last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`.
