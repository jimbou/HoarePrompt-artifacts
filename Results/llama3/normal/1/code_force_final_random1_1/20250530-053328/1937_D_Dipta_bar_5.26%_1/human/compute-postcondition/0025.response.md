Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` has a length of `n` and consists of '<' and '>' characters. The value of `n` is still positive and equal to the length of `s`. The list `A` contains elements `x` that are calculated based on the previous elements and indices of '>' in `s`. The list `idx_A` contains indices `i` of '>' characters in `s`. The lists `B` and `idx_B` are still empty. The variable `j` is still 0. The new variable `i` is assigned the value `n - 1`.
