Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` is a list and is not empty, and its last element is 0, and `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` remains the same, its length `n` is still a positive integer greater than 0, the index `i` is still 0, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is still '>'. The list `idx_A` now has an additional element, which is the current index `i` (0). The list `A` also has an additional element `x`, which is calculated based on the previous elements of `A` and `idx_A`.
