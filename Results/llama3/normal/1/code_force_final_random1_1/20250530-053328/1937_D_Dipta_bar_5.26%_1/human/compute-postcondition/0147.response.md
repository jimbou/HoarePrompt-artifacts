Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '<' in `s`, `j` is `n - 1`, `i` is 2, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1]`, `l` is either `n` if `s[i]` is '>', or `l` is less than or equal to `r` if `s[i]` is '<', `r` is either 0 if `l` is greater than `r` and `r` equals 0, or `r` is greater than 0 if `l` is greater than `r` and `r` is not equal to 0.**

In this final state, the values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The new variables `a`, `x`, and `b` are introduced, and their values are determined based on the values of `l` and `r`. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is set to `n`, and if `s[i]` is '<', then `l` is either less than or equal to `r` or greater than `r`. The value of `r` is either 0 or greater than 0, depending on the value of `l`.
