Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '<' in `s`, `j` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is the length of `B`. If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is `A[0]`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` (where `a` is the first element of list `A`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and `i` is 0). Otherwise, if `l` is equal to `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value of `n - i` which is equal to `n` is being printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l` is equal to `r`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`**

The code increments the value of `l` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for printing the values of `a`, `b`, and `i` are still dependent on the values of `l` and `r`.
