Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '<' in `s`, `j` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` in `s` is '<', `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is equal to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is updated to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `b` has been updated to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. This means that the value of `b` now depends on the values of `B[r]`, `idx_B[r]`, `i`, and `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
