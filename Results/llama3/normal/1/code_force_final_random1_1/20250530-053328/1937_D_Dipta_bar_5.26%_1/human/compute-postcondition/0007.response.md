Postcondition: ***s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s and is greater than 0, i is 0, and the current value of s[i] is '>'. If idx_A is empty, A is a list containing one element which is 0. Otherwise, A is a list with an additional element x, idx_A is a list and is not empty, and x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A).***
