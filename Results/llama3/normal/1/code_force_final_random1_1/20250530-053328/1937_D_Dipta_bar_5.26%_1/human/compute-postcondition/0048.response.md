Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, B is a list with elements x, where x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), idx_B is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '<' in s. j is n - 1, i is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the list `A` and its index list `idx_A` also remain unchanged. The list `B` and its index list `idx_B` are populated with elements based on the indices of the character '<' in the string `s`. The loop counter `j` is equal to `n - 1` and the index `i` is equal to `0`.
