Postcondition: ***s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 2, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, B is a list with elements x, where x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), idx_B is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '<' in s, j is n - 1, i is 2, r is r - 1, a is B[r], b is A[l - 1] if l - r - 1 is less than or equal to 0. Otherwise, b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)***
