Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`. The current value of `s[i]` is '<'.***
