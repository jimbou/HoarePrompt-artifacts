Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` is a list with an additional element 2, and if `idx_A` is empty, `A` is a list containing the integer 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x` which is equal to the last element of `A` plus `(2 - the last element of idx_A)` times the length of `idx_A`. If `s[i]` is not '>', no changes are made to `idx_A` and `A`.**
