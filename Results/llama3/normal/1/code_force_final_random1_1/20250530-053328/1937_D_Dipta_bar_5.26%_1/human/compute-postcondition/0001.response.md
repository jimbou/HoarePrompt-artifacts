The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s and is greater than 0, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list, i is 0**
