Output State: **s is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 1, A is a list with elements x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A), idx_A is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '>' in s, B is a list with elements x, where x is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), idx_B is a list with elements i, where i is the index of the character '<' in s, j is n - 1, i is 1, a is A[l], x is r - (l + 2), b is B[r - 1].**

The code assigns the value of `A[l]` to `a`, the value of `r - (l + 2)` to `x`, and the value of `B[r - 1]` to `b`. No other variables are affected.
