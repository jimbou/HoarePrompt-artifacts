Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 2]) * len(idx_A)`, `idx_A` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '>' in `s`, `B` is a list with elements `x`, where `x` is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list with elements `i`, where `i` is the index of the character '<' in `s`, `j` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` in `s` is '<', `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is equal to `B[r]`. The current value of `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0.***
