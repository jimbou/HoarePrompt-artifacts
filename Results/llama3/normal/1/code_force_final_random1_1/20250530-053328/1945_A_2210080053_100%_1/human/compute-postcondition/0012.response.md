Output State: **a is an integer equal to the first integer in the t-th line, b is an integer equal to the sum of the second and third integers in the t-th line, c is an integer equal to the third integer in the t-th line, stdin contains no lines of input, open(0) is a file object with no lines, s is the t-th line, and this is printed: (a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3].**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variables a, b, and c will have the values of the first, second, and third integers in the t-th line of the input, respectively. The stdin will be empty, and the file object open(0) will have no lines. The variable s will be the t-th line of the input. The output will be either a minus the integer division of negative b by 3 or -1, depending on whether c is less than the remainder of b divided by 3.
