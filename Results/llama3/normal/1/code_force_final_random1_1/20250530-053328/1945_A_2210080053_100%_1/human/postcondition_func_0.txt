The function reads multiple lines of input from standard input, where the first line contains a single integer t, and each of the following t lines contains three integers a, b, and c. It then processes each line, adding b and c, and prints either the result of a minus the integer division of the sum of b and c by 3, or -1, depending on whether c is less than the remainder of the sum of b and c divided by 3. After processing all lines, the function leaves the standard input empty and the file object open(0) with no lines.
