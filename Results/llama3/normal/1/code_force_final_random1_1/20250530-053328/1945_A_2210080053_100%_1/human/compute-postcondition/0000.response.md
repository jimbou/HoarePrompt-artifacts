The only objects in the loop head are variables  s and open(0). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object open(0). If the file object has at least 1 line the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the file object must have at least 1 line and the s is the first line.
State: **stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9), open(0) is a file object that must have at least 1 line, s is the first line**
