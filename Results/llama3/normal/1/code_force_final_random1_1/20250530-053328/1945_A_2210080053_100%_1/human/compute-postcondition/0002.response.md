To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the expression step by step, considering the given initial state.

The expression to be printed is:
```
(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]
```
This is a tuple with two elements: `(a - -b // 3)` and `-1`. The value to be printed is determined by the condition `c < b % 3`.

Let's analyze the components:

1. `a`: an integer
2. `b`: an integer equal to its original value plus `c`
3. `c`: an integer
4. `b % 3`: the remainder of `b` divided by 3
5. `c < b % 3`: a boolean condition that checks if `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by 3

Now, let's consider the two possible cases:

**Case 1:** `c < b % 3` is `True`

In this case, the expression will evaluate to the first element of the tuple: `a - -b // 3`.

* `a` is an integer
* `-b` is the negation of `b`, which is an integer equal to its original value plus `c`
* `-b // 3` is the integer division of `-b` by 3, which will result in an integer
* `a - -b // 3` is the difference between `a` and the result of the integer division, which will also result in an integer

So, in this case, the output will be an integer.

**Case 2:** `c < b % 3` is `False`

In this case, the expression will evaluate to the second element of the tuple: `-1`.

So, in this case, the output will be `-1`.

Now, let's summarize the possible outputs:

* If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the output will be an integer, specifically `a - -b // 3`.
* If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the output will be `-1`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, we can't provide a single numerical value for the output. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **either an integer (a - -b // 3) if c is less than the remainder of b divided by 3, or -1 otherwise**
