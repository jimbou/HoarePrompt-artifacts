To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given expression step by step, based on the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and Their Values**:
   - `a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the third line.
   - `b` is an integer equal to twice the third integer in the third line plus the first integer in the third line.
   - `c` is an integer equal to the third integer in the third line.

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - The expression to be printed is `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.
   - This is a tuple with two elements: `a - -b // 3` and `-1`.
   - The expression is indexed by a boolean condition `[c < b % 3]`, which will evaluate to either `True` or `False`.
   - In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0` when used as indices.

3. **Condition Evaluation**:
   - The condition `c < b % 3` needs to be evaluated.
   - `b % 3` calculates the remainder of `b` divided by `3`.
   - Since `c` is the third integer in the third line and `b` is calculated based on this line, the comparison depends on the specific values in the third line.

4. **Possible Outputs**:
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the expression will print the first element of the tuple: `a - -b // 3`.
     - `-b // 3` calculates the integer division of `-b` by `3`, effectively rounding down the division result.
     - Subtracting this from `a` gives a value that depends on the specific integers in the third line.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the expression will print the second element of the tuple: `-1`.

Given the initial state and without specific values for the integers in the third line, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `a - -b // 3`. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions:

- If `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by `3`, the output will be the result of `a` minus the integer division of `-b` by `3`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `-1`.

Output: **Either (a - -b // 3) or -1, depending on whether c is less than b % 3**
