Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
    b += c
    print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is an integer, b is an integer equal to its original value plus c, c is an integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input with t-1 lines remaining, open(0) is a file object that must have at least 1 line, s is the first line, and this is printed: either a minus the integer division of negative b by 3 or -1, depending on whether c is less than the remainder of b divided by 3

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is an integer equal to the first integer in the second line, b is an integer equal to the sum of the second and third integers in the second line, c is an integer equal to the third integer in the second line, stdin contains t-2 lines of input, open(0) is a file object with at least t-2 lines, s is the second line, and this is printed: (a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is an integer equal to the first integer in the third line, b is an integer equal to twice the third integer in the third line plus the first integer in the third line, c is an integer equal to the third integer in the third line, stdin contains t-2 lines of input, open(0) is a file object with at least t-2 lines, s is the third line, and this is printed: a minus the integer division of negative b by 3 if c is greater than or equal to the remainder of b divided by 3, otherwise -1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
