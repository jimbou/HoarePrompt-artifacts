Output State: **a is an integer equal to the first integer in the third line, b is an integer equal to twice the third integer in the third line plus the first integer in the third line, c is an integer equal to the third integer in the third line, stdin contains t-2 lines of input, open(0) is a file object with at least t-2 lines, s is the third line**

The first line assigns the values of the first, second, and third integers in the third line to `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively. The second line increments `b` by the value of `c`. Since `b` was initially equal to the sum of the second and third integers in the third line, and `c` is equal to the third integer in the third line, `b` becomes twice the third integer in the third line plus the first integer in the third line. No other variables are affected.
