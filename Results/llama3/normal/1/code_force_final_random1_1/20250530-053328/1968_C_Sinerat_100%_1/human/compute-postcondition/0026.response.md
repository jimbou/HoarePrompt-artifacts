The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is at least 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`n` is an integer at least 3, `i` is at least 2, `x` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + x[0], the third element is 1000 + x[0] + x[1], and so on, until the ith element which is 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-2] + x[i-1], stdin contains t-1 lines: a sequence of t-1 lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t+1 lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers, and the list a is printed**
