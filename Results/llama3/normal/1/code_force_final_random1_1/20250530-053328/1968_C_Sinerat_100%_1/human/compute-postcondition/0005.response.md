Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + x[0], the third element is 1000 + x[0] + x[1], and the rest are 0, stdin contains t-1 lines: a sequence of t-1 lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, which is `1000 + x[0] + x[1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain the same. The stdin still contains the same input lines.
