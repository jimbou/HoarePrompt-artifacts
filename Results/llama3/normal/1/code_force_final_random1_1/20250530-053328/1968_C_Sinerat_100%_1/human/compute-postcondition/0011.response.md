The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input has at least t lines the loop executes again for the t+1 time. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains t-1 lines: a sequence of t-1 lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers, and the list `a` is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must contain t lines: a sequence of t lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t+1 lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is n-1, `x` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + x[0], the third element is 1000 + x[0] + x[1], and so on, until the nth element which is 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2], and stdin contains t lines: a sequence of t lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t+1 lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers, and the list `a` is printed**
