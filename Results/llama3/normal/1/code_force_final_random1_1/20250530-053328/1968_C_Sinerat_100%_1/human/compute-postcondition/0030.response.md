Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 2, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + `x[0]`, the third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and so on, until the `n`th element which is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + ... + `x[n-2]`, stdin contains `t-1` lines: a sequence of `t-1` lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by `t+2` lines where each line contains `n-1` space-separated integers, and the list `a` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` has reached `n-1`, and the list `a` has been fully populated with the cumulative sum of the elements in list `x`, starting from 1000. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
