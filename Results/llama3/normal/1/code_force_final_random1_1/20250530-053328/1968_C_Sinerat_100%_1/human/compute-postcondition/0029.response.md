Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 3, `i` is at least 3, `x` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + x[0], the third element is 1000 + x[0] + x[1], and so on, until the ith element which is 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-2] + x[i-1] + x[i-1] + x[i-1], stdin contains t-1 lines: a sequence of t-1 lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers, and the list a is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, which means the ith element of list `a` now includes the sum of all elements in list `x` up to index `i-1` twice. The other variables remain unchanged.
