Output State: **n is an integer at least 2, i is n-1, x is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + x[0], the third element is 1000 + x[0] + x[1], and so on, until the nth element which is 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2], stdin contains t-1 lines: a sequence of t-1 lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t+1 lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the variable `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`, and the list `a` has been fully populated with cumulative sums of the elements in list `x`, starting from 1000. The state of the other variables, including `n`, `x`, and the contents of `stdin`, remains unchanged.
