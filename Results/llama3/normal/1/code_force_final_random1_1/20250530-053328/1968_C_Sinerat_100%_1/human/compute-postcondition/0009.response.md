The code prints the elements of the list `a`, which contains `n` integers. The first element of `a` is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `x`.

Since `x` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, the elements of `a` will be:

* `a[0]`: 1000
* `a[1]`: 1000 + `x[0]` (where `x[0]` is an integer between 1 and 500)
* `a[2]`: 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` (where `x[1]` is an integer between 1 and 500)
* ...
* `a[n-1]`: 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + ... + `x[n-2]` (where `x[n-2]` is an integer between 1 and 500)

Since the exact values of the elements in `x` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of `a` as described above.

Output: **1000, 1000 + x[0], 1000 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]**
