Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a sequence of lines. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the next t lines contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500). Each of the next t lines contains n-1 space-separated integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 1000
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 2, `i` is n-1, `x` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + x[0], the third element is 1000 + x[0] + x[1], and so on, until the nth element which is 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2], and stdin contains t-1 lines: a sequence of t-1 lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers, and the list `a` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer at least 2, i is n-1, x is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + x[0], the third element is 1000 + x[0] + x[1], and so on, until the nth element which is 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2], stdin contains t-1 lines: a sequence of t-1 lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t+1 lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers, and the list a is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer at least 2, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + `x[0]`, the third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and so on, until the `n`th element which is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + ... + `x[n-2]`, stdin contains `t-1` lines: a sequence of `t-1` lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by `t+2` lines where each line contains `n-1` space-separated integers, and the list `a` is printed, the list `a` which is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + `x[0]`, the third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and so on, until the `n`th element which is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + ... + `x[n-2]` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
