To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`). 

Since `i` is already `n-1` before the loop starts, we need to adjust `i` to be at least 1 for the loop to execute. This is because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, so `i` must be within this range.

State: **`n` is an integer at least 2, `i` is at least 1, `x` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + x[0], the third element is 1000 + x[0] + x[1], and so on, until the nth element which is 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2], stdin contains t-1 lines: a sequence of t-1 lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t+2 lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers, and the list a is printed**
