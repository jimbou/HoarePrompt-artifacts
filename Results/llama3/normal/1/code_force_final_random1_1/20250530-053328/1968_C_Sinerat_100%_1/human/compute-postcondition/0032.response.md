Output: **`n` is an integer at least 2, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + `x[0]`, the third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and so on, until the `n`th element which is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + ... + `x[n-2]`, stdin contains `t-1` lines: a sequence of `t-1` lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by `t+2` lines where each line contains `n-1` space-separated integers, and the list `a` is printed, the list `a` which is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + `x[0]`, the third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and so on, until the `n`th element which is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + ... + `x[n-2]` is being printed**
