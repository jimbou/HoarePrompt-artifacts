Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 4, `i` is 3, `x` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + x[0], the third element is 1000 + x[0] + x[1], the fourth element is 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2], and the remaining elements are not yet defined, stdin contains t-1 lines: a sequence of t-1 lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t+1 lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, which is equivalent to 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the same number of lines, but the contents of the lines are not affected by the code.
