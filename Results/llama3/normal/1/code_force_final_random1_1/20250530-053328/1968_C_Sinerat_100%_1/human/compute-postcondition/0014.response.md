Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + x[0], and the remaining elements are not yet defined, stdin contains t-1 lines: a sequence of t-1 lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t+1 lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, which means the second element of `a` is now 1000 + x[0]. The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the same number of lines, but the contents of the lines are not affected by the code.
