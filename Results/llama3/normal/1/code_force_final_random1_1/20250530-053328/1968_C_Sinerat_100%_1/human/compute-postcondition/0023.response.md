Output State: **n is an integer at least 2, i is n-1, x is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + x[0], the third element is 1000 + x[0] + x[1], and so on, until the nth element which is 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2], stdin contains t-1 lines: a sequence of t-1 lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t+2 lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers, and the list a is printed**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` is an integer at least 2, and `i` is `n-1`. The list `x` contains `n-1` integers between 1 and 500. The list `a` contains `n` integers, where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `x`. The stdin contains `t-1` lines with a single integer each, followed by `t+2` lines with `n-1` space-separated integers each. The list `a` is printed.
