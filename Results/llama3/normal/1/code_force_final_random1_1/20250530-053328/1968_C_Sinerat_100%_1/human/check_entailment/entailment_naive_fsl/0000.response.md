Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find an array a_1, ..., a_n that satisfies the given conditions. The key insight is that a_i can be chosen as a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}, which ensures that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}.

The program initializes a_1 to 1000, which is an arbitrary value that satisfies the condition 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. Then, for each i from 2 to n, it calculates a_i as a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}. This ensures that a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i, as required.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs, including edge cases such as when n is 2 or when x_i is 1. The output is also correctly formatted, with the values of a_1, ..., a_n printed separated by spaces.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
