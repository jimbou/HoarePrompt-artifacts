Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 500, x is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, a is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000 and the rest are 0, stdin contains t-1 lines: a sequence of t-1 lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, which was read from the first line of stdin. The list `x` contains n-1 integers between 1 and 500, which were read from the second line of stdin. The list `a` has n elements, where the first element is 1000 and the rest are 0. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, which include a sequence of t-1 lines with a single integer each, followed by t lines with n-1 space-separated integers each.
