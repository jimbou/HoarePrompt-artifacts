Output State: **`n` is an integer at least 2, `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + `x[0]`, the third element is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]`, and so on, until the `n`th element which is 1000 + `x[0]` + `x[1]` + ... + `x[n-2]`, stdin contains 0 lines, and the list `a` is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 2, the value of `i` is still `n-1`, the list `x` still contains `n-1` integers between 1 and 500, and the list `a` still contains `n` integers where each element is the sum of 1000 and the corresponding elements in the list `x`. Additionally, the standard input (stdin) is empty, and the list `a` has been printed.
