To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `x` and `a`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer at least 3, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 500, `a` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1000, the second element is 1000 + x[0], and the remaining elements are not yet defined, stdin contains t-1 lines: a sequence of t-1 lines where each line contains a single integer, followed by t+1 lines where each line contains n-1 space-separated integers**
