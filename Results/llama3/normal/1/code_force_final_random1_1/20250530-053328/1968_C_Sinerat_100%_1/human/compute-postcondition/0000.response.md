The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains a sequence of lines. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the next t lines contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500). Each of the next t lines contains n-1 space-separated integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500). So for the loop to be executed  the input must be at least 1 and the `_` is 0.
