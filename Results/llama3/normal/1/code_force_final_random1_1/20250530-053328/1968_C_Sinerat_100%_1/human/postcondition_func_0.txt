The function reads a sequence of lines from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n-1 space-separated integers. The function then generates a list of n integers, where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding integer from the input list. The function prints each generated list. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases, until all input lines have been processed.
