Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, sx is 0, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a list containing two elements which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, i is 2, c is equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, and cons is equal to x plus sx minus 2.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` to `c`. Since `i` is 2, `c` becomes `l[2] - l[1] - 1`. The second line appends the value of `c` to the list `val`. Since `val` initially contains one element, it now contains two elements, both of which are `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`. No other variables are affected.
