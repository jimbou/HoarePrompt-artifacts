The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and `x` must be at least 3.
State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 3 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a list containing two elements which are the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1 and the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, i is 3**
