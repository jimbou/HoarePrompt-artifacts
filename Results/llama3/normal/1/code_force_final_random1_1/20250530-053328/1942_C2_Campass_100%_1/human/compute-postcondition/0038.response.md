Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is at least 2, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a list containing three elements which are the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, and the difference between the fourth element of l and the third element of l minus 1, i is 3, c is equal to the difference between the fourth element of l and the third element of l minus 1, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is -2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

The code modifies the value of `c` and appends a new value to the `val` list. The value of `c` is updated to be the difference between the fourth element of `l` and the third element of `l` minus 1. The `val` list now contains three elements: the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` minus 1, the difference between the third element of `l` and the second element of `l` minus 1, and the difference between the fourth element of `l` and the third element of `l` minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
