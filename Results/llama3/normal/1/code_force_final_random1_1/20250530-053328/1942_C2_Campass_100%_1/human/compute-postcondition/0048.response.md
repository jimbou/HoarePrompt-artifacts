Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, `sx` is 2*y+i if y is less than c, otherwise sx is i, `y` is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive and is equal to its original value minus c, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, `val` is a sorted list containing x elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of val, `c` is equal to i divided by 2, `cons` is equal to sx minus 2 which is 2*y+i-2 if y is less than c, otherwise cons is i-2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of `c` has been updated to be equal to `i` divided by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
