Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1 and must have at least 1 element, i is the first element of val, c is equal to i divided by 2, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is -2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of c has been updated to be equal to i divided by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
