To determine what will be printed when the `print(cons)` statement is executed, let's break down the given initial state and the formula for `cons`.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive.
   - `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive.
   - `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` if `y` is greater than or equal to all `c's`, otherwise `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` plus 2*y times the number of times `y` is less than `c`.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `l's` last element is `n` plus the first element of `l`.
   - `val` is an empty list.
   - `i` is the last element of `val`.
   - `c` is equal to `i` divided by 2.
   - `cons` is equal to `x` plus `sx` minus 2.

2. **Calculating `cons`**:
   - Since `val` is an empty list, `sx` will be 0 because there are no elements to sum.
   - Given that `y` is 0, it will always be less than any positive `c`, but since `y` is 0, the term "2*y times the number of times `y` is less than `c`" will also be 0. Thus, `sx` remains 0.
   - `i` is the last element of an empty list, so `i` is undefined in the context of list elements, but since `val` is empty, we can consider `i` as 0 for the sake of calculation because it doesn't affect the sum `sx`.
   - `c` is `i` divided by 2, which would be 0 if we consider `i` as 0.
   - `cons` is `x` plus `sx` minus 2. Since `sx` is 0, `cons` simplifies to `x - 2`.

3. **Output**:
   - The value of `cons` will be `x - 2`, where `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive)**
