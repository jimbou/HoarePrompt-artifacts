Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, sx is 4*y+2*i if y is less than c, otherwise sx is 2*i, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive and is equal to its original value minus c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1 and must have at least 2 elements, i is the second element of val, c is equal to i divided by 2, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is 4*y+2*i-2 if y is less than c, otherwise cons is 2*i-2, and stdin contains t-3 test cases if y < c, otherwise stdin contains t-2 test cases.***
