Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n-x` inclusive, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `l`'s last element is `n` plus the first element of `l`, `val` is a sorted list containing `x` elements which are the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` minus 1, the difference between the third element of `l` and the second element of `l` minus 1, and so on until the difference between the last element of `l` and the second last element of `l` minus 1, sorted by the key lambda function which first checks if the number is odd or even and then the number itself, `i` is `x`.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is 0, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, sx is 2y plus i, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing at least 1 element which are the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, and so on until the difference between the last element of l and the second last element of l minus 1, sorted by the key lambda function which first checks if the number is odd or even and then the number itself, i is the first element of val, and c is equal to i divided by 2, y is y minus c.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is 0, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive and is y minus c, sx is 2y plus i plus 2 times y minus c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements which are the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, and so on until the difference between the last element of l and the second last element of l minus 1, sorted by the key lambda function which first checks if the number is odd or even and then the number itself, i is the second element of val, and c is equal to i divided by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is 0, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive and is y minus i//2, sx is 2y plus i plus 2 times y minus i//2 plus i, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements which are the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, and so on until the difference between the last element of l and the second last element of l minus 1, and the next difference between consecutive elements in l, minus 1, sorted by the key lambda function which first checks if the number is odd or even and then the number itself, i is the third element of val, and c is equal to i divided by 2 which is i//2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
