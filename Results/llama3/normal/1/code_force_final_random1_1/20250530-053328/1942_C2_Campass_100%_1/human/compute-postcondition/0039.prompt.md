Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is an empty list, i is the last element of val, c is equal to i divided by 2 which is i//2, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is -2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is at least 1, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a list containing one element which is the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, i is 1, c is equal to the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is -2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is at least 2, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a list containing two elements which are the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, and the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, i is 2, c is equal to the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is -2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is at least 2, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a list containing three elements which are the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, and the difference between the fourth element of l and the third element of l minus 1, i is 3, c is equal to the difference between the fourth element of l and the third element of l minus 1, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is -2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
