To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `val`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `val`. If `val` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `x` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop and `x` is also the number of elements in `val`, we can conclude that `val` must have at least 1 element.

At the start of the loop, `i` is `x`, which is the number of elements in `val`. However, for the loop to execute, `i` should be the first element of `val`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be the first element of `val`.

State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1 and must have at least 1 element, i is the first element of val, c is equal to the difference between the last element of l and the second last element of l minus 1, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is -2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.**
