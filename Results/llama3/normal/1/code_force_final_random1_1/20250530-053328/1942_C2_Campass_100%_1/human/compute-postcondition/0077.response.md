State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x) and must have at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list val, c is equal to i // 2. If y is less than c, sx is 2y + i, otherwise sx is i. y is an integer, and cons is equal to x plus sx minus 2**
