Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is equal to the number of iterations of the loop, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, i is x, c is equal to the difference between the last element of l and the second last element of l minus 1, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is -2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, sx is 2*y+i if y is less than c, otherwise sx is i, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive and is equal to its original value minus c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1 and must have at least 1 element, i is the first element of val, c is equal to i divided by 2, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is 2*y+i-2 if y is less than c, otherwise cons is i-2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, sx is 4*y+3*i if y is less than c, otherwise sx is 3*i, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive and is equal to its original value minus 2*c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1 and must have at least 2 elements, i is the second element of val, c is equal to i divided by 2, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is 4*y+3*i-2 if y is less than c, otherwise cons is 3*i-2, and stdin contains t-3 test cases if y < c, otherwise stdin contains t-2 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, sx is 4*y+3*i+2*y+i if y is less than c, otherwise sx is 3*i+i, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive and is equal to its original value minus 2*c minus c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1 and must have at least 3 elements, i is the third element of val, c is equal to i divided by 2, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is 4*y+3*i+2*y+i-2 if y is less than c, otherwise cons is 3*i+i-2, and stdin contains t-4 test cases if y < c, otherwise stdin contains t-3 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
