Output State: **t is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2*10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map. It then uses this function to read the first line of the input, which contains a single integer `t`, representing the number of test cases. The value of `t` is assigned to the variable `t`. The remaining test cases are still in stdin, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
