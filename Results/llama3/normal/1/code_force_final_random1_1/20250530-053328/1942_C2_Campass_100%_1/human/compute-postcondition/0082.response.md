To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in val:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `i` and `val`.

According to the code, `val` is a sorted list containing `x` elements, and `i` is the second element in the list `val`. For the loop to execute again, `val` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in the list `val`.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `l`'s last element is `n` plus the first element of `l`, `val` is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements which are `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, sorted by the key lambda `x: (1 - x & 1, x)`, `i` is the third element in the list `val`, `c` is equal to `i // 2`, `y` is an integer and is less than `c`, `cons` is equal to `x` plus `sx` minus 2, where `sx` is `2y + i`, and `sx` is updated to `sx + 2y + i**
