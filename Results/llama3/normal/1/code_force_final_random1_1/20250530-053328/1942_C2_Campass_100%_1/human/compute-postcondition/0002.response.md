Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2*10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1. The stdin now contains `t-2` test cases, each consisting of two lines as described. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` have been assigned values from the first line of the test case in stdin, with `n` being an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` being an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, and `y` being an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive. The variable `sx` has been initialized to 0. The list `l` contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, sorted in ascending order, and its last element is `n` plus the first element of `l`. The list `val` is empty.
