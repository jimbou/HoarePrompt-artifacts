Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), i is the third element in the list val, c is equal to i // 2, y is an integer and is less than i // 2, cons is equal to x + sx - 2, where sx is 2y + i. sx is updated to sx + i, y is updated to y - c.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains unchanged, being greater than or equal to 0. The value of n remains unchanged, being an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive. The value of x remains unchanged, being an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive. The list l remains unchanged, being a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with its last element being n plus the first element of l. The list val remains unchanged, being a sorted list containing at least 3 elements which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x). The value of i remains unchanged, being the third element in the list val. The value of c remains unchanged, being equal to i // 2. The value of y is updated to y - c, which is still less than i // 2. The value of sx is updated to sx + i. The value of cons remains unchanged, being equal to x + sx - 2.
