Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, sx is 0, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is an empty list, i is the last element of val, c is equal to i divided by 2, and cons is equal to x plus sx minus 2, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is equal to x plus sx minus 2)**

Here is a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, but it remains greater than or equal to 0. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` have been updated to new integer values, but their ranges remain the same. The value of `sx` has been reset to 0. The list `l` has been updated to a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with its last element being `n` plus the first element of `l`. The list `val` remains empty, and the value of `i` is still the last element of `val`. The value of `c` is still equal to `i` divided by 2. The value of `cons` is still equal to `x` plus `sx` minus 2, and it has been printed.
