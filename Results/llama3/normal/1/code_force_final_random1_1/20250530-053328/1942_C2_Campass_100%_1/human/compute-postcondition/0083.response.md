Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `l`'s last element is `n` plus the first element of `l`, `val` is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements which are `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, sorted by the key lambda `x: (1 - x & 1, x)`, `i` is the third element in the list `val`, `c` is equal to `i // 2`, `y` is an integer and is less than `i // 2`, `cons` is equal to `x` plus `sx` minus 2, where `sx` is `2y + i`, and `sx` is updated to `sx + 2y + i**.

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated to `i // 2`, which is half of the third element in the list `val`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
