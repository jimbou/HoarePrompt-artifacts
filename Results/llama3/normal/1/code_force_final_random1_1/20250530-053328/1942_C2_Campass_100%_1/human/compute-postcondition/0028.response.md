Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is 0, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive and is y minus the sum of all c values, sx is 2y plus the sum of all i values, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is an empty list, i is the last element of val, c is equal to i divided by 2 which is i//2, cons is equal to sx minus 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: t is still greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin still contains t-2 test cases, n is still an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is still an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is 0, y is still an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive and is y minus the sum of all c values, sx is still 2y plus the sum of all i values, l is still a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is still n plus the first element of l, val is still an empty list, i is still the last element of val, c is still equal to i divided by 2 which is i//2, and cons is now equal to sx minus 2.
