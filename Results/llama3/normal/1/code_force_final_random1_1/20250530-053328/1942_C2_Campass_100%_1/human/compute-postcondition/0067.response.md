To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1, x + 1):`

The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `x` is an integer between 2 and `min(n, 2*10^5)` inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `x` remains the same.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `n`, `sx`, `y`, `l`, `val`, `c`, and `cons`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, `sx` is 0, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `l`'s last element is `n` plus the first element of `l`, `val` is a list containing two elements which are `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, `i` is 3, `c` is equal to `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, and `cons` is equal to `x` plus `sx` minus 2**
