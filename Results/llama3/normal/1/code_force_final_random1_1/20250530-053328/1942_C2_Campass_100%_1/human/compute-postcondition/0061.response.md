The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` if `y` is greater than or equal to all `c's`, otherwise `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` plus 2*y times the number of times `y` is less than `c`, `y` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `l's` last element is `n` plus the first element of `l`, `val` is an empty list, `i` is the last element of `val`, `c` is equal to `i` divided by 2, and `cons` is equal to `x` plus `sx` minus 2, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is equal to `x` plus `sx` minus 2)**
