Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, sx is 2*y+i if y is less than c, otherwise sx is i, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive and is equal to its original value minus c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1 and must have at least 1 element, i is the first element of val, c is equal to i divided by 2, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is 2*y+i-2 if y is less than c, otherwise cons is i-2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `l`, `val`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `sx` is updated to `2*y+i` if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise it becomes `i`. The value of `y` is decremented by `c`. The value of `cons` is updated to `2*y+i-2` if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise it becomes `i-2`.
