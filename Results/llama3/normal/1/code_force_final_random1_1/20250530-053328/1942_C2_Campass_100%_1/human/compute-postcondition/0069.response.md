Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, sx is 0, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a list containing x elements which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, i is x, c is equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, and cons is equal to x plus sx minus 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 'val' now contains 'x' elements, each of which is the difference between consecutive elements in the list 'l' minus 1. The variable 'i' has reached the value of 'x', and the variable 'c' is equal to the last element in 'val'. The variable 'cons' remains equal to 'x' plus 'sx' minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
