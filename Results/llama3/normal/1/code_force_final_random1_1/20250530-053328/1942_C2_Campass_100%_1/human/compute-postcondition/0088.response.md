Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), i is the last element in the list val, c is equal to i // 2, y is an integer and is less than i // 2, cons is equal to x + sx + i - 2, where sx is 2y + i.**

In this output state, the value of cons has been updated to x + sx + i - 2, where sx is 2y + i. The other variables remain unchanged.
