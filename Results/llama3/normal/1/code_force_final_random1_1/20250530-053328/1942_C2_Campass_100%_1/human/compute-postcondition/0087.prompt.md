Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, `sx` is 0, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, `val` is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), `i` is x, `c` is equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, and `cons` is equal to x plus sx minus 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x) and must have at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list val, c is equal to i // 2. If y is less than c, sx is 2y + i, otherwise sx is i. y is an integer, and cons is equal to x plus sx minus 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x) and must have at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list val, c is equal to i // 2, y is an integer and is less than c, cons is equal to x plus sx minus 2, where sx is 2y + i, and sx is updated to sx + 2y + i.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), i is the third element in the list val, c is equal to i // 2, y is an integer and is less than i // 2, cons is equal to x + sx - 2, where sx is 2y + i. sx is updated to sx + i, y is updated to y - c.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
