Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, `sx` is 0, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, `val` is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), `i` is x, `c` is equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, and `cons` is equal to x plus sx minus 2.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `val` is now sorted based on the key lambda function, which first prioritizes the parity of the elements (even or odd) and then their values. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
