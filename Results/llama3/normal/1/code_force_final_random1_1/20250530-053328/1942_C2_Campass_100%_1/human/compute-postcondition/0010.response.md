Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n-x` inclusive, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `l`'s last element is `n` plus the first element of `l`, `val` is a sorted list containing `x` elements which are the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` minus 1, the difference between the third element of `l` and the second element of `l` minus 1, and so on until the difference between the last element of `l` and the second last element of `l` minus 1, sorted by the key lambda function which first checks if the number is odd or even and then the number itself, `i` is `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `val` is now sorted based on the key function. The key function first checks if the number is odd or even (1 - x & 1), and then the number itself. This means that all the even numbers in `val` will come before the odd numbers, and within each group, the numbers are sorted in ascending order.
