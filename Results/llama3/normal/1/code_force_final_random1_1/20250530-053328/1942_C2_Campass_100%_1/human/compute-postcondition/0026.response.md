Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is 0, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive and is y minus i//2, sx is 2y plus i plus 2 times y minus i//2 plus i, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements which are the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, and so on until the difference between the last element of l and the second last element of l minus 1, and the next difference between consecutive elements in l, minus 1, sorted by the key lambda function which first checks if the number is odd or even and then the number itself, i is the third element of val, and c is equal to i divided by 2 which is i//2.**
