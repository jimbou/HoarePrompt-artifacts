Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, sx is the sum of all elements in val if y is greater than or equal to all c's, otherwise sx is the sum of all elements in val plus 2*y times the number of times y is less than c, y is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is an empty list, i is the last element of val, c is equal to i divided by 2, cons is equal to sx minus 2, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The number of test cases `t` is 0.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged, which is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive.
- The value of `x` remains unchanged, which is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive.
- The value of `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` if `y` is greater than or equal to all `c`s. Otherwise, `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` plus 2 times `y` times the number of times `y` is less than `c`.
- The value of `y` is 0.
- The list `l` remains unchanged, which is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and its last element is `n` plus the first element of `l`.
- The list `val` is empty.
- The value of `i` is the last element of `val`, which is undefined since `val` is empty.
- The value of `c` is equal to `i` divided by 2, which is undefined since `i` is undefined.
- The value of `cons` is equal to `sx` minus 2.
- The standard input `stdin` is empty.
