Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is equal to the number of iterations of the loop, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a list containing x elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, i is x, c is equal to the difference between the last element of l and the second last element of l minus 1, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is -2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: the number of test cases 't' is one less than its original value, 'n' is still an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, 'x' is equal to the number of iterations of the loop and is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, 'y' is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, 'sx' is still 0, 'l' is a sorted list of 'x' distinct integers from 1 to 'n' and its last element is 'n' plus the first element of 'l', 'val' is a list containing 'x' elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of 'l' minus 1, 'i' is equal to 'x', 'c' is equal to the difference between the last element of 'l' and the second last element of 'l' minus 1, 'cons' is still -2, and there are t-2 test cases left in stdin.
