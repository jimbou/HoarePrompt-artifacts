Output: ** `t` is 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` if `y` is greater than or equal to all `c's`, otherwise `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` plus 2*y times the number of times `y` is less than `c`, `y` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `l's` last element is `n` plus the first element of `l`, `val` is an empty list, `i` is the last element of `val`, `c` is equal to `i` divided by 2, and `cons` is equal to `x` plus `sx` minus 2, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is equal to `x` plus `sx` minus 2)**
