To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `x` is an integer between 2 and `min(n, 2*10^5)` inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `x` is already greater than or equal to 2, it remains the same.

State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is at least 2, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a list containing two elements which are the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, and the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, i is 3, c is equal to the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, cons is equal to sx minus 2 which is -2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.**
