The code prints the value of `cons` which is calculated as `sx` minus 2. Since `sx` is equal to 2 times `y` plus the sum of all `i` values, and `y` is equal to `y` minus the sum of all `c` values, we need to understand the values of `y` and the sum of all `i` values to determine the value of `sx`.

The value of `y` is between 0 and `n-x` inclusive, but since `y` is equal to `y` minus the sum of all `c` values, it means that the sum of all `c` values is 0, and therefore `y` is equal to its original value.

The sum of all `i` values is not explicitly given, but since `i` is the last element of `val`, and `val` is an empty list, it means that `i` is not defined, and therefore the sum of all `i` values is 0.

Now, we can calculate the value of `sx` which is 2 times `y` plus the sum of all `i` values, which is 2 times `y` plus 0, which is 2 times `y`.

Since `cons` is equal to `sx` minus 2, we can calculate the value of `cons` which is 2 times `y` minus 2.

Therefore, the code prints the value of `cons` which is 2 times `y` minus 2, where `y` is an integer between 0 and `n-x` inclusive.

Output: **2 times y minus 2 (where y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive)**
