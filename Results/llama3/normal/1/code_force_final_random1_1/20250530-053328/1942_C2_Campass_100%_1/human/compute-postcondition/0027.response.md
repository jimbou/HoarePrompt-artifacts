Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is 0, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive and is y minus the sum of all c values, sx is 2y plus the sum of all i values, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is an empty list, i is the last element of val, and c is equal to i divided by 2 which is i//2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

The loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables have been updated accordingly. The value of `t` remains the same, `stdin` still contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is still an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is still an integer between 2 and `min(n, 2*10^5)` inclusive and is 0, `y` has been updated to be `y` minus the sum of all `c` values, `sx` has been updated to be `2y` plus the sum of all `i` values, `l` is still a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `l`'s last element is still `n` plus the first element of `l`. The list `val` is now empty, `i` is the last element of `val` (which is `None` since `val` is empty), and `c` is equal to `i` divided by 2 which is `i//2`.
