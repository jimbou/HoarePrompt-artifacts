Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2*10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is 0, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive and is y minus the sum of all c values, sx is 2y plus the sum of all i values, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is an empty list, i is the last element of val, c is equal to i divided by 2 which is i//2, cons is equal to sx minus 2, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is sx minus 2, sx is 2y plus the sum of all i values, and y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive and is y minus the sum of all c values)
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` if `y` is greater than or equal to all `c's`, otherwise `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` plus 2*y times the number of times `y` is less than `c`, `y` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `l's` last element is `n` plus the first element of `l`, `val` is an empty list, `i` is the last element of `val`, `c` is equal to `i` divided by 2, and `cons` is equal to `x` plus `sx` minus 2, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is equal to `x` plus `sx` minus 2)
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), i is the last element in the list val, c is equal to i // 2, y is an integer and is less than i // 2, cons is equal to x + sx + i - 2, where sx is 2y + i, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is x + sx + i - 2, where sx is 2y + i)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
