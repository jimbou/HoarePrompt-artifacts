To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `val`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `val` list. If `val` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element of `val`, and `val` contains at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must have at least one more element, and `i` must be the next element in `val`. Since `val` is sorted by the key lambda function, the next element in `val` must be the next difference between consecutive elements in `l`, minus 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive and is 0, `y` is an integer between 0 and `n-x` inclusive and is `y` minus `c`, `sx` is 2y plus `i` plus 2 times `y` minus `c`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `l`'s last element is `n` plus the first element of `l`, `val` is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements which are the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` minus 1, the difference between the third element of `l` and the second element of `l` minus 1, and so on until the difference between the last element of `l` and the second last element of `l` minus 1, and the next difference between consecutive elements in `l`, minus 1, sorted by the key lambda function which first checks if the number is odd or even and then the number itself, `i` is the third element of `val`, and `c` is equal to `i` divided by 2**
