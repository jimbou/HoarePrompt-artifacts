To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is an integer between 2 and `min(n, 2*10^5)` inclusive.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `x` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and `min(n, 2*10^5)` inclusive, `sx` is 0, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `l`'s last element is `n` plus the first element of `l`, `val` is a list containing one element which is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, `i` is 2, `c` is equal to `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, and `cons` is equal to `x` plus `sx` minus 2**
