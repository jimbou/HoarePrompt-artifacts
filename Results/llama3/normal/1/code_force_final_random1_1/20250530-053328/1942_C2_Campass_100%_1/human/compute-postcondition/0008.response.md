Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, x is an integer between 3 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, y is an integer between 0 and n-x inclusive, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, val is a list containing three elements which are the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, and the difference between the fourth element of l and the third element of l minus 1, i is 3**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in `stdin` also remains the same as no input operations are performed. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are also unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `sx` remains 0 as it is not modified. The list `l` remains a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and its last element is still `n` plus the first element of `l`. The list `val` now contains three elements: the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` minus 1, the difference between the third element of `l` and the second element of `l` minus 1, and the difference between the fourth element of `l` and the third element of `l` minus 1. The value of `i` remains 3 as it is not modified.
