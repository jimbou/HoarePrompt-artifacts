Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, representing the total number of elements, the number of distinct integers, and a threshold value, respectively. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive integers in the sorted list, considering the threshold value y. If y is less than half of any difference, it adds 2*y to the sum. Finally, the function prints the result, which is the sum of the differences plus x minus 2, for each test case.**
