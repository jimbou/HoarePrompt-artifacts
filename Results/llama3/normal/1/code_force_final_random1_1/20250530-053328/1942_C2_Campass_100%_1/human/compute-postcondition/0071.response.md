According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `val`. If `val` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, `sx` is 0, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, `val` is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x), `i` is x, `c` is equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, and `cons` is equal to x plus sx minus 2. So for the loop to be executed  the list `val` must have at least 1 element and the variable `i` is the first element in the list `val`.
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 inclusive, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2*10^5) inclusive, `sx` is 0, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and l's last element is n plus the first element of l, `val` is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x) and must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `val`, `c` is equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, and `cons` is equal to x plus sx minus 2**
