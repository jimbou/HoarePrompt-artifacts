Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b`, `curr` is 0, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values` and its count in `cnt_b` is now `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, and all other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `a[i]` is still in the set of integers `b_values`, but its count in `cnt_b` has been updated.
