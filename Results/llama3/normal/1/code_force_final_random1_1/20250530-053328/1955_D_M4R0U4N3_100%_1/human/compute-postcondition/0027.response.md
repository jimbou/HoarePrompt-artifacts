Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is incremented by its frequency. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1. If the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set of unique values in `b`, `ans` is 0***
