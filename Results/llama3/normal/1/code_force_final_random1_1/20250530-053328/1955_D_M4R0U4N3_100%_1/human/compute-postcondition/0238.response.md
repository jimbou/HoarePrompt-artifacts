Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b` that is empty, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1 and is printed, `curr` is either increased or decreased based on the conditions specified in the initial state, and all elements in `cnt_b` are reset to 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that all elements in the `cnt_b` dictionary are reset to 0, and the set `b_values` is empty. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]`, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]`, `cnt_b[a[m-1]]`, `cnt_b[m-1]`, `_`, `ans`, and `curr` remain unchanged from the initial state.
