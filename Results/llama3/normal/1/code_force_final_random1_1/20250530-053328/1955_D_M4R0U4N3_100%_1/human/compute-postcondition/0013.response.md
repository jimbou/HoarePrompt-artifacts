The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the current value of `a[i]` in the list `cnt_b` by 1.

Since `a[i]` is in the set of unique values in `b` (`b_values`), the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is decremented by 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is incremented by its frequency, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `b_values` is a set of unique values in `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is in the set of unique values in `b` (`b_values`).**
