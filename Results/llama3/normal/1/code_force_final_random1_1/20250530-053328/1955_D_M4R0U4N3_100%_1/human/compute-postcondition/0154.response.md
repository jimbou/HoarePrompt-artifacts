Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the first value in `b_values`, `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b_values` is not empty, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, and the values of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_b[i]` has been updated to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions specified in the initial state still hold, including the relationships between `n`, `m`, `i`, `ans`, `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]`.
