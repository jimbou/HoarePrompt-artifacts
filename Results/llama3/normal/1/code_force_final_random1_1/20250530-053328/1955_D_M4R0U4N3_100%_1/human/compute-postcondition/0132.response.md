Postcondition: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 1`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]` is incremented by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then no changes are made.**
