Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 2`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, which is decremented by 1. This means that if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then the count of `a[i + m]` in `cnt_b` is reduced by 1. The other variables, including `curr`, are not affected by this code snippet.
