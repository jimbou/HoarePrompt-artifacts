Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `m`, `b_values` is a set of unique values in `b`, `ans` is 1, and the current value of `curr` is the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b`, and `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The value of `curr` is still the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b`, and it is still greater than or equal to `k`.
