Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer equal to the third input, a is a list of integers from the second input, b is a list of integers from the third input, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in b is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in a, except for all elements in b_values which are now 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is m-1, b_values is a set of integers equal to the elements of b, ans is 0, and curr is 0.**

The code block modifies the initial state by assigning the elements of list `b` to the set `b_values`, resetting the count of these elements in `cnt_b` to 0, and initializing the variables `ans` and `curr` to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `m-1`. The other variables and stdin remain unaffected.
