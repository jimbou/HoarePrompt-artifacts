To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b`, `curr` is 0, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty**
