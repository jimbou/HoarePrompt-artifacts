The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, except for all elements in `b_values` which are now 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, `i` is the last element in `b_values`, `b_values` is an empty set, and `ans` is the number of times the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
