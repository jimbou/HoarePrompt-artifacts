Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1, and the values of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
