Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set of unique values in `b`, `ans` is 2 if the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `n - m` must be greater than 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either incremented by 1 if it was initially greater than 0, or remains 0 if it was initially 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. The current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` if `ans` is 2, otherwise `curr` is less than `k` if `ans` is 1. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**
