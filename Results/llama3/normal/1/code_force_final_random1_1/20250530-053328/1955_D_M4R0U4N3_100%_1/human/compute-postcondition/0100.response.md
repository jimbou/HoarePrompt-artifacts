Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input, `b` is a list of integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, except for all elements in `b_values` which are now 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set of integers equal to the elements of `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is either 2 or 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is 2 and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `curr` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is now 2 and `cnt_b[a[i]]` has been decremented by 1. Otherwise, `curr` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
