Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, k is an integer equal to the third input, a is a list of integers from the second input, b is a list of integers from the third input, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in b is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in a, except for all elements in b_values which are now 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is the last element in b_values, b_values is an empty set, and ans is the number of times the number of elements in a that are in b_values and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in cnt_b is greater than or equal to k.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    cnt_b[b[i]] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input, `b` is a list of integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, except for all elements in `b_values` which are now 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `b_values` is an empty set, `ans` is the number of times the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `cnt_b[b[0]]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input, `b` is a list of integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, except for all elements in `b_values` which are now 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `b_values` is an empty set, `ans` is the number of times the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than 2, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input, `b` is a list of integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, except for all elements in `b_values` which are now 0 and `cnt_b[b[2]]` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `b_values` is an empty set, `ans` is the number of times the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to `k`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
