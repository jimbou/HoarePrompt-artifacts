Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` remain unchanged. The relationship between `n` and `m` also remains the same, with `n` being greater than `m`. The value of `i` is still equal to `m + 1`, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is still decremented by 1.
