Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer equal to the third input, a is a list of integers from stdin, b is a list of integers from stdin, i is the last value in b_values, ans is increased by 1 for every iteration where curr is greater than or equal to k, b_values is not empty and has at least as many values as the number of iterations, cnt_b[a[i + m]] and cnt_b[a[i]] are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, and cnt_b[i] is 0, _ is 1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    cnt_b[b[i]] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b_values` is not empty and has at least as many values as the number of iterations, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b_values` is not empty and has at least as many values as the number of iterations, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b_values` is not empty and has at least as many values as the number of iterations, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[2 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[2]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[2]` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
