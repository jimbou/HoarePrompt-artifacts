Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of `b[i]` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1**

The code increments the count of `b[i]` in the `cnt_b` list by 1. Since `i` is 1, the count of `b[1]` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
