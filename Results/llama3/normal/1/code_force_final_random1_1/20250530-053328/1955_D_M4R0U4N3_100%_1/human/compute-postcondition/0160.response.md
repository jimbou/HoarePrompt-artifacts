The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `range(int(input()))`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `range(int(input()))`. If `range(int(input()))` has at least one more value the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `range(int(input()))` has at least one value. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `range(int(input()))` must have at least one more value.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the last value in `b_values`, `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b_values` is not empty and has at least as many values as the number of iterations, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `_` is 1**
