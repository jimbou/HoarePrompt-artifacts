The only object in the loop head is variable  i and set b_values, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the set b_values.  If the set has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, b_values has at least 1 element, i is a different element from b_values. So for the loop to be executed one more time the set must have at least 2 elements and the i is a different element from b_values.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b` that has at least 2 elements, `i` is a different element from `b_values`, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1 and is printed, `curr` is either increased or decreased based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[i]` is reset to 0**
