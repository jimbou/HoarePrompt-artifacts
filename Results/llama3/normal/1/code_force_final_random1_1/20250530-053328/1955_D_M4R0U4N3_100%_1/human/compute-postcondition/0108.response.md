Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input, `b` is a list of integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, except for all elements in `b_values` which are now 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `m`, `b_values` is a set of integers equal to the elements of `b`, `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 for all `i` in range `m`, then `curr` is `m`. Otherwise, `curr` is less than `m`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has iterated over the entire list `a` and updated the count of each element in `b` accordingly. The variable `i` has reached the end of the list `a`, and the variable `curr` has been updated to reflect the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` and have a non-negative count. If all elements in `a` are in `b` and have a non-negative count, then `curr` is equal to the length of `a`. Otherwise, `curr` is less than the length of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
