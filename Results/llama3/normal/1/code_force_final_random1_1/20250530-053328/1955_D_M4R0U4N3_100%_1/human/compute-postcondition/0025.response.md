Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is incremented by its frequency, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decremented by 1, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set of unique values in `b`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is incremented by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values except for `curr`, which has been incremented by 1. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, indicating that one more input has been processed.
