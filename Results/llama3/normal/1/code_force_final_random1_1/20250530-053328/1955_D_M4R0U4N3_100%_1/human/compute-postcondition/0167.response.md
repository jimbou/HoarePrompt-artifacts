Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b_values` is not empty and has at least as many values as the number of iterations, `cnt_b[b[2]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[2 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[2]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[2]` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt_b[b[2]]` is now one more than its previous value. The rest of the variables retain their initial values and conditions.
