Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, m, and k (1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). The third line contains m space-separated integers (1 <= b_i <= 10^6). max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros.**

The code initializes `max_val` to 1000000 and creates a list `cnt_b` of 1000001 zeros. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged as the code does not read or modify it. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are not affected by the code and remain as specified in the initial state.
