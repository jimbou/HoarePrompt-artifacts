Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input, `b` is a list of integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, except for all elements in `b_values` which are now 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `m`, `b_values` is a set of integers equal to the elements of `b`, `curr` is either `m` or less than `m` depending on whether `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 for all `i` in range `m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1, and the values of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 1`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, then if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]` is incremented by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 2`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1, if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
