Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b_values` is not empty and has at least as many values as the number of iterations, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `_` is 1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` has been incremented by 1, while the values of all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions specified in the initial state for `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are still valid, and `cnt_b[i]` remains 0. The stdin is still empty.
