According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and `m`. If `n - m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `m`. So for the loop to be executed  `n` must be greater than `m` and `i` is `m`.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and must be greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `m`**
