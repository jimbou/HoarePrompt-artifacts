Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the third value in `b_values`, `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b_values` is not empty and has at least three values, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, and `cnt_b[i]` is now 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt_b[i]` has been reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `ans`, and `b_values` are still the same as in the initial state, and the conditions for `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are still valid.
