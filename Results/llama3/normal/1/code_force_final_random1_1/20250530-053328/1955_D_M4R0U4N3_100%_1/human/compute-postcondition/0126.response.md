Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m`, `ans` is increased by 1, `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the values of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state.**

In natural language, the output state means that the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are still applicable, and their values may have been updated based on those conditions. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `curr` remain the same as in the initial state.
