Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than 2, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input, `b` is a list of integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, except for all elements in `b_values` which are now 0, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decremented by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `b_values` is a set of integers equal to the elements of `b`, `ans` is 0. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `i` is 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
