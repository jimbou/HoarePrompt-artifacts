Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b`, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1, `curr` is decreased by 1, if `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1 and `curr` is decreased by 1, if the number of times `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1, otherwise, `ans` remains 0, if `a[i + m]` is in the set of integers `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is increased by 1, otherwise, no changes are made, if the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1, otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `curr` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for updating `cnt_b[a[i]]`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, and `ans` are still valid.
