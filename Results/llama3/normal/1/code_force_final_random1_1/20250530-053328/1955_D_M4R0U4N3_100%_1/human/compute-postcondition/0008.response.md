The value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1. The value of `b[i]` is an integer from the list `b` at index `i`, which is 2. The value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of `b[2]` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2**
