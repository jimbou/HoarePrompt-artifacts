Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input, `b` is a list of integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, except for all elements in `b_values` which are now 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `b_values` is an empty set, `ans` is the number of times the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1**

The value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is 1 and `b` is a list of integers from the third input. This means that the count of the second element in `b` is incremented by 1 in the `cnt_b` list. The states of the other variables are not affected.
