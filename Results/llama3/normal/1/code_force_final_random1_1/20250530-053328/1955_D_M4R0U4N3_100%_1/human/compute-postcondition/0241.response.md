Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second and third lines contain n and m space-separated integers, respectively. The function then calculates the total number of times the number of elements in the second line that are in the third line and have a count greater than or equal to 0 is greater than or equal to k, for all test cases. The function prints the total count for each test case and empties the standard input after processing all test cases.**
