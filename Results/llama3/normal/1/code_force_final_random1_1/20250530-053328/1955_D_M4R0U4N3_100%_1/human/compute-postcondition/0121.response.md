Postcondition: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, and the current value of `i` is such that `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. Additionally, the current value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
