The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and b_values, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b_values`. If `b_values` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is `n-m-1`, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b`, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1. If `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1 and `curr` is decreased by 1. If the number of times `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[i + m]` is in the set of integers `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. and ans is printed does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `b_values` is not empty and i is now the first element in `b_values`.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is the first element in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b` that is not empty, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1.
