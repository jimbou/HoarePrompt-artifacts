Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b`, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1. If `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1 and `curr` is 0, otherwise `curr` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` has been decreased by 1 if `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values`, and the value of `curr` has been updated based on the new value of `cnt_b[a[i]]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
