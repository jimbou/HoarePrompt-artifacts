The code increments the count of the value at index `i` in list `b` in the `cnt_b` list.

`cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, and `b` is a list of integers. The value at index `i` in `b` is `b[i]`. The count of this value in `cnt_b` is incremented by 1.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of `b[i]` is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0**
