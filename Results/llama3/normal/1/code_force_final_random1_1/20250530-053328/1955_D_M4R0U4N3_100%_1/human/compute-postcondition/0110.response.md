Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input, `b` is a list of integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, except for all elements in `b_values` which are now 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `m`, `b_values` is a set of integers equal to the elements of `b`, `ans` is 1, `curr` is either `m` or less than `m` depending on whether `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 for all `i` in range `m`.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1, so the new value of `ans` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `curr` is still dependent on the conditions specified in the initial state, so it can be either `m` or less than `m` depending on whether `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 for all `i` in range `m`.
