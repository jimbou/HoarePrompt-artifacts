Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer equal to the third input, a is a list of integers from stdin, b is a list of integers from stdin, i is m-1, ans is 0, b_values is a set of integers from list b, curr is 0, cnt_b[b[m-1]] is increased by 1, cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]] and cnt_b[a[m-1]] are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, cnt_b[m-1] is 0, _ is 1, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
            curr += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b`, `curr` is 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is 0, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1. If `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, otherwise no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b`, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1. If `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1 and `curr` is 1. Otherwise, `curr` is 2. If `a[i]` is not in the set of integers `b_values`, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b`, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1. If `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1 and `curr` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
