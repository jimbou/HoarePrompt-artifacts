Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is `m`, `b_values` is a set of unique values in `b`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values in `b`, `ans` is 2 if the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `n - m` must be greater than 0. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either incremented by 1 if it was initially greater than 0, or remains 0 if it was initially 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. The current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` if `ans` is 2, otherwise `curr` is less than `k` if `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set of unique values in `b`, `ans` is either 3 if the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `n - m` must be greater than 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either incremented by 1 if it was initially greater than 0, or remains 0 if it was initially 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. The current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` if `ans` is 3, otherwise `curr` is less than `k` if `ans` is 2. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then no changes are made to `cnt_b` or `curr`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b` or `curr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 3, `b_values` is a set of unique values in `b`, `ans` is either 4 if the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 3 if the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2, `n - m` must be greater than 2. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either incremented by 1 if it was initially greater than 0, or remains 0 if it was initially 0. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. The current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` if `ans` is 4, otherwise `curr` is less than `k` if `ans` is 3. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, then no changes are made to `cnt_b` or `curr`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if it was initially greater than 0, or remains 0 if it was initially 0, and `curr` is decremented by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is either 4 or 3, otherwise `ans` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
