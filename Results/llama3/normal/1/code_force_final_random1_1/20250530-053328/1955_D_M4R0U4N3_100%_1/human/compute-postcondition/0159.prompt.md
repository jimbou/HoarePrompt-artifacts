Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the values of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, and the final value of `ans` is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the first value in `b_values`, `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b_values` is not empty, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, and the values of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the second value in `b_values`, `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b_values` is not empty, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the third value in `b_values`, `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b_values` is not empty and has at least three values, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, and `cnt_b[i]` is now 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
