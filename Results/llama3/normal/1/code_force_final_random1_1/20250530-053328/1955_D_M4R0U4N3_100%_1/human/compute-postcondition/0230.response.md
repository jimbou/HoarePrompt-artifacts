Based on the precondition, the value of `ans` is determined by the conditions specified in the initial state. The value of `ans` is initially 0 and is updated based on the conditions specified.

The value of `ans` is updated as follows:

* If `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1 and `curr` is decreased by 1. If the number of times `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
* If `a[i + m]` is in the set of integers `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `k`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the calculated value based on the conditions specified in the initial state)**
