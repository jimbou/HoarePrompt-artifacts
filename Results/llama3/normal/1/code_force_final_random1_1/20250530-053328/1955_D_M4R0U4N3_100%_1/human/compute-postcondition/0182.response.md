The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again m must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b`, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1. If `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1 and `curr` is 1. Otherwise, `curr` is 2. If `a[i]` is not in the set of integers `b_values`, no changes are made.**
