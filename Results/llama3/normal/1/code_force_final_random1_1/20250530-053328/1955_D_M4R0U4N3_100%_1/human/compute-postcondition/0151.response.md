The code prints the value of `ans`, which is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `ans` depends on the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `curr`, and `k`, as well as the updates to `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `curr`, `k`, and the array `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of iterations where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of iterations where curr is greater than or equal to k)**
