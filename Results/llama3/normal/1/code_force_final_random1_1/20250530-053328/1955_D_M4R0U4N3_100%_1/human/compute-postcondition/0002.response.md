Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

The code reads three integers from the first line of stdin and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. Then, it reads a list of integers from the second line of stdin and assigns it to `a`. Finally, it reads another list of integers from the third line of stdin and assigns it to `b`. The values of `max_val` and `cnt_b` remain unchanged. After the code executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus the two inputs that were read.
