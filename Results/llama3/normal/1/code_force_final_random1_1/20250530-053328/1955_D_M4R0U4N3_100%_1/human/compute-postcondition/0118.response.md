Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 and if the current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
