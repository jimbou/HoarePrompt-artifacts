Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the sliding window approach to count the number of good subsegments of array `a`. The program initializes a count array `cnt_b` to keep track of the count of each element in array `b`. It then iterates over the first `m` elements of array `a` and updates the count of each element in `cnt_b`. If the count of an element is greater than or equal to 0, it increments the `curr` variable. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the `ans` variable.

The program then slides the window to the right by iterating over the remaining elements of array `a`. For each element, it updates the count of the element in `cnt_b` and updates `curr` accordingly. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

Finally, the program prints the total count of good subsegments for each test case and empties the standard input after processing all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
