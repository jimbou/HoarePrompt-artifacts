Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 2`, `ans` is increased by 1, if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is increased by 1. The conditions related to `a[i + m]`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` also remain the same as in the initial state, with no changes made by the given code snippet.
