Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` remain the same as they were in the initial state. The value of `i` is still equal to `m + 1`. The only change is in the value of `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]`, which has been incremented by 1.
