Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is `n-m-1`, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b`, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1. If `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1 and `curr` is decreased by 1. If the number of times `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[i + m]` is in the set of integers `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the variables have reached their final values. The value of `i` is now `n-m-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n-m` times. The values of `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` have been updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state. The value of `curr` has been updated based on the number of times `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values`. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `b_values`, and `_` remain unchanged.
