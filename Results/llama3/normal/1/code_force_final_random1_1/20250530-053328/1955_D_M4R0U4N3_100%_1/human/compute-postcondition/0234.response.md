To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for i in b_values:`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop iterates over the set `b_values`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is the first element in `b_values`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be updated to the next element in `b_values`.

Since `b_values` is a set, we can't assume any particular order of elements. However, we can say that `i` will be a different element from `b_values` in the next iteration.

The other variables in the state, such as `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cnt_b`, `_`, `ans`, and `curr`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is a different element from `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b` that is not empty, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1 and is printed, `curr` is either increased or decreased based on the conditions specified in the initial state**
