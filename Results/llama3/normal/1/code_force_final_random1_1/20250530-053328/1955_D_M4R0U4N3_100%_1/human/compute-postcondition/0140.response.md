To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step by step.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`.
- `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is equal to `m + 2`.

The code snippet is:
```python
cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
```

This line of code increments the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1.

Since `i` is equal to `m + 2`, we can substitute `i` in the code snippet:
```python
cnt_b[a[m + 2]] += 1
```

The value of `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` is incremented by 1.

The values of `n`, `m`, and `i` are not changed by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`.
- `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is equal to `m + 2`.
- `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 2`, and `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` is incremented by 1.**
