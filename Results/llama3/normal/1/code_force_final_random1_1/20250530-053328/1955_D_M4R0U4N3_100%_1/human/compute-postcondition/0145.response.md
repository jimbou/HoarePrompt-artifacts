The value of `curr` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `curr` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `curr` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state is: `n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 2`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1.
