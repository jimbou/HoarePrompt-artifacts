Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, and the current value of `i` is such that `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, indicating that the count of `a[i + m]` in `b_values` has been reduced by 1. Additionally, if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, the value of `curr` is decreased by 1, indicating that the current count of `a[i]` in `b_values` has been reduced by 1.
