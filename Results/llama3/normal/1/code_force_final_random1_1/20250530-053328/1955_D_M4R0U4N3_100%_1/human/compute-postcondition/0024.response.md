Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is incremented by its frequency, `cnt_b[a[2]]` is decremented by 1, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set of unique values in `b`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_b[a[2]]` has been decremented by 1, indicating that the count of `a[2]` in `cnt_b` has been reduced by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
