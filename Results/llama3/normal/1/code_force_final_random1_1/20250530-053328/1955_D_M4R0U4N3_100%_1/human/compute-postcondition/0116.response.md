The value of `curr` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `curr` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `curr` is decreased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and `curr` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and `curr` is decreased by 1.**
