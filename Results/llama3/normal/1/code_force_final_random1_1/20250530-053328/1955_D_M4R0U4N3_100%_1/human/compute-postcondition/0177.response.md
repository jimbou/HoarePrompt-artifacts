The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b`, `curr` is 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `curr` is 0, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1. If `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, otherwise no changes are made.**
