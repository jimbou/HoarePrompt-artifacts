Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b` that has at least 2 elements, `i` is a different element from `b_values`, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1, `cnt_b[i]` is reset to 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1 and is printed, `curr` is either increased or decreased based on the conditions specified in the initial state.**

In this output state, the only change is that `cnt_b[i]` is reset to 0. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
