Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 2`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, no changes are made.***
