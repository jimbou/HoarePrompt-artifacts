Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is `n-m-1`, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b`, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1. If `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1 and `curr` is decreased by 1. If the number of times `a[i]` is in the set of integers `b_values` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `a[i + m]` is in the set of integers `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `curr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. and ans is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is the first element in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b` that is not empty, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1 and is printed, `curr` is either increased or decreased based on the conditions specified in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is a different element from `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b` that is not empty, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1 and is printed, `curr` is either increased or decreased based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[i]` is reset to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input and greater than `m`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b` that has at least 2 elements, `i` is a different element from `b_values`, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1, `cnt_b[i]` is reset to 0, `ans` is either 0 or 1 and is printed, `curr` is either increased or decreased based on the conditions specified in the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
