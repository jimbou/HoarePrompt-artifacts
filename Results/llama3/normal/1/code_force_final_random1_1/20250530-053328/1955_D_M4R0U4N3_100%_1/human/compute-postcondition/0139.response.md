To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`, and `m` since it is used in the loop condition.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. So, `i` becomes `m + 2`.

The state of `n` and `m` remains the same, as they are not modified within the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 2`.**
