To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, which is `i` and `b_values`. The loop will execute if `b_values` is not empty. Since `i` is equal to `n` before the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be the first value in `b_values`. 

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the first value in `b_values`, `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b_values` is not empty, and the values of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state**
