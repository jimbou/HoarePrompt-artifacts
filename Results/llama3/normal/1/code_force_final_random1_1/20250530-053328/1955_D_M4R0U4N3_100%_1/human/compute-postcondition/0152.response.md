Output: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the values of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, and the final value of `ans` is being printed**
