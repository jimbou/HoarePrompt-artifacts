The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and must be greater than 2, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input, `b` is a list of integers from the third input, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, except for all elements in `b_values` which are now 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `b_values` is a set of integers equal to the elements of `b`, `ans` is 0**
