Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, `curr` is increased by 1, and the current value of `i` is such that `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decreased by 1. Additionally, the current value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the code was executed are still true.
