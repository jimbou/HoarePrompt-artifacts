Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 1`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then if `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, then if `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]` is incremented by 1 and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the variable `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
