The value of `curr` is decremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`. The value of `m` is still an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0. The value of `i` is still equal to `m + 1`. The value of `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]` is still incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `cnt_b[a[m + 1]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` is decremented by 1**
