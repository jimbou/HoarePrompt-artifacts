Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 1`. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
