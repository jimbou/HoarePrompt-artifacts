According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input has at least 1 test case the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros. So for the loop to be executed  the input must have at least 1 test case.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros**
