Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is incremented by its frequency and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `b_values` is a set of unique values in `b`, `ans` is 0. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is decremented by 1.***
