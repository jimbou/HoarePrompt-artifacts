Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input and is greater than `m`, `m` is an integer equal to the second input and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `m + 2`, `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` is incremented by 1, and `curr` is decremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, and `cnt_b[a[m + 2]]` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the value of `curr` is decreased by 1.
