Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 integers where the count of each element in `b` is decremented by the frequency of its occurrence in `a`, except for the element at index `i` which is now 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is the next element in `b_values`, `b_values` is a set of unique values in `b` that must have at least 1 element, and `ans` is the number of times the number of elements in `a` that are in `b_values` and have a count greater than or equal to 0 in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the count of the element at index `i` in `cnt_b` is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
