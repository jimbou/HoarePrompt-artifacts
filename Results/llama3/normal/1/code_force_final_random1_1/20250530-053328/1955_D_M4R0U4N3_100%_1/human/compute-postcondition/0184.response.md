Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer equal to the third input, `a` is a list of integers from stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `b_values` is a set of integers from list `b`, `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is increased by 1, `cnt_b[a[m-1 + m]]` and `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` are updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, `cnt_b[m-1]` is 0, `_` is 1, `curr` is either 2 or 3.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` is either 2 or 3 because it was initially either 1 or 2 and was incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
