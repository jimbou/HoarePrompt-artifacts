Output State: **i is 1, l is an integer between 1 and 10^4, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed copy of array, ans is an empty list, j is l-1, stdin is empty.**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `l`. Since `stdin` is empty, this line does not affect any other variables. The second line assigns a list of integers from `stdin` to `array`. Since `stdin` is empty, this line does not affect any other variables. The third line assigns a list of lowercase English letters to `alp`. This line does not affect any other variables. The fourth line assigns a reversed copy of `array` to `rev_array`. This line does not affect any other variables. The fifth line assigns an empty list to `ans`. This line does not affect any other variables. The sixth line assigns `l-1` to `j`. This line does not affect any other variables.
