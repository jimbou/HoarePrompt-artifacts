Output State: **`i` is 2, `l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the (count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` - 1)th lowercase English letter for all `j` in range `l`, `j` is `l-1`, and `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `i`, `array`, `alp`, and `rev_array` as in the initial state. The value of `l` will remain the same as it is not modified in the loop. The value of `ans` will be a list containing the (count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` - 1)th lowercase English letter for all `j` in range `l`. The value of `j` will be `l-1` as it is the last value assigned to `j` in the loop. The value of `stdin` will remain empty as it is not modified in the loop.
