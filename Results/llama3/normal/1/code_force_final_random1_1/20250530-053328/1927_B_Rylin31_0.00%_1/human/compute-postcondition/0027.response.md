The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `l`. If `j` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `l` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `l` must be greater than 1.
State: **`i` is 2, `l` is an integer greater than 1, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the (count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is 1, `stdin` is empty**
