Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 0, stdin is empty, l is an integer between 1 and 10^4, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed copy of array, ans is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(l):
    ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter and the (count of the second element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `l` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, the (count of the second element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, and the (count of the third element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
