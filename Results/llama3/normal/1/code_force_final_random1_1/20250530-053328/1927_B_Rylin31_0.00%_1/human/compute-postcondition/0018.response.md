Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing three lowercase English letters where the third letter is the (count of `rev_array[2]` in `rev_array[2:]` - 1)th letter in `alp`, `j` is 2, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending a new letter to the list. This new letter is the (count of `rev_array[2]` in `rev_array[2:]` - 1)th letter in `alp`. The count of `rev_array[2]` in `rev_array[2:]` is the number of occurrences of the element at index 2 in the reversed array, starting from index 2 to the end of the array. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
