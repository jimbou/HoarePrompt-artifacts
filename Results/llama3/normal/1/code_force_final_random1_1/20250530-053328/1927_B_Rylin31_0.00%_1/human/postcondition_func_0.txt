This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints a string of lowercase English letters. It accepts a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. The function reverses the list of integers, counts the occurrences of each integer in the reversed list, and maps these counts to corresponding lowercase English letters. It then prints a string composed of these letters. The function processes all test cases and prints the resulting strings.
