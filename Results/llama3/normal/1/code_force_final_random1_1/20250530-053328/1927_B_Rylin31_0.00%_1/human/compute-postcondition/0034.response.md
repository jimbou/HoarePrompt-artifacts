Output State: **`i` is `t`, `stdin` is empty, `l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the (count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` - 1)th lowercase English letter for all `j` in range `l`, `j` is `l-1`, and a string of length `l` consisting of lowercase English letters is being printed.**

This output state means that the loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. After each iteration, the loop has processed a list of integers `array` of length `l`, and has printed a string of length `l` consisting of lowercase English letters. The string is formed by concatenating the letters in the `ans` list, where each letter is the (count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` - 1)th letter in the alphabet `alp`. The loop has finished executing, and the input `stdin` is empty.
