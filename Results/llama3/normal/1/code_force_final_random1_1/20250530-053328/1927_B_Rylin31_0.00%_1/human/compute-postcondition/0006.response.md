The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `l`. If `j` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `l` must be greater than 1.
State: **`i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `l` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter and the (count of the second element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is 2**
