The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input. If `i` is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and the input is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, the (count of the second element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, ..., the (count of the last element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is `l-1`**
