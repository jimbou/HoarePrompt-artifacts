Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm',
        'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
    rev_array = array[::-1]
    ans = []
    for j in range(l):
        ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
    print(''.join(map(str, ans)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, the (count of the second element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, ..., the (count of the last element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is `l-1`, and a string formed by concatenating the elements of `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing `l` lowercase English letters where each letter is the (count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` - 1)th letter in `alp`, `j` is `l-1`, `stdin` is empty, and the string formed by joining all the letters in the `ans` list is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the (count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` - 1)th lowercase English letter for all `j` in range `l`, `j` is `l-1`, and `stdin` is empty, and a string of length `l` consisting of lowercase English letters is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
