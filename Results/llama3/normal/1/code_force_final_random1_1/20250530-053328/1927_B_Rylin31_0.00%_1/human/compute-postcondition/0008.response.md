Output State: **`i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, the (count of the second element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, ..., the (count of the last element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is `l-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` remains 0, the standard input `stdin` is still empty, the length `l` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4, the `array` and `alp` lists remain unchanged, and `rev_array` is still a reversed copy of `array`. The list `ans` now contains the (count of each element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, and the loop counter `j` is equal to `l-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `l` times.
