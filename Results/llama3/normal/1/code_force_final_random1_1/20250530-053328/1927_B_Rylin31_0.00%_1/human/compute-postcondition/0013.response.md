To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l`. If `l` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`i` is 1, `l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
