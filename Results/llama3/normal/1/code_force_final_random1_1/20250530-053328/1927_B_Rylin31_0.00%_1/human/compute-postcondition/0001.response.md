Output State: **i is 0, stdin is empty, l is an integer between 1 and 10^4, array is a list of integers, alp is a list of lowercase English letters, rev_array is a reversed copy of array, ans is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code executes as follows:

1. `l = int(input())`: This line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `l`. Since stdin initially contains an integer `t` between 1 and 10^4, `l` becomes this integer value. Stdin is now empty.

2. `array = list(map(int, input().split()))`: This line reads a space-separated list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `array`. Since stdin is empty after the previous line, this line does not modify `array`.

3. `alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']`: This line assigns a list of lowercase English letters to `alp`.

4. `rev_array = array[::-1]`: This line creates a reversed copy of `array` and assigns it to `rev_array`.

5. `ans = []`: This line initializes an empty list and assigns it to `ans`.

The final state includes the initial value of `i` (0), the updated value of `l` (an integer between 1 and 10^4), the empty stdin, and the newly created variables `array`, `alp`, `rev_array`, and `ans` with their respective values.
