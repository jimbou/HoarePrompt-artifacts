Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing one lowercase English letter, `j` is 0, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, `ans` now contains one lowercase English letter, which is the letter at the index equal to the count of the first element of `rev_array` minus 1 in `alp`. The other variables remain unchanged.
