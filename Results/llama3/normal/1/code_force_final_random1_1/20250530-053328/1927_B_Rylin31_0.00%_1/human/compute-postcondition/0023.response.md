To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `stdin` is empty.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `stdin` needs to have a new input value.

Since `stdin` is empty, we assume that a new input value will be provided. Let's call this new input value `new_input`.

The state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing `l` lowercase English letters where each letter is the (count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` - 1)th letter in `alp`, `j` is `l-1`, `stdin` contains `new_input`**

Note that we don't know the exact value of `new_input`, but we know that it will be used to determine the range of the loop.
