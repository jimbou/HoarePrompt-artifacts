Output State: **`i` is 2, `l` is an integer greater than 2, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the (count of `rev_array[1]` in `rev_array[1:]` - 1)th lowercase English letter and the (count of `rev_array[2]` in `rev_array[2:]` - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is 2, and `stdin` is empty.**

Explanation: The code appends the (count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` - 1)th lowercase English letter to `ans`. Since `j` is 2, it appends the (count of `rev_array[2]` in `rev_array[2:]` - 1)th lowercase English letter to `ans`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
