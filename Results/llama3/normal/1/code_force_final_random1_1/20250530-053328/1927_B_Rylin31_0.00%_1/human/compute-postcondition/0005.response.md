Output State: **`i` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `l` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `array` is a list of integers, `alp` is a list of lowercase English letters, `rev_array` is a reversed copy of `array`, `ans` is a list containing the (count of the first element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter and the (count of the second element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter, `j` is 1**

The code appends a new element to the `ans` list. This new element is the (count of the second element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` - 1)th lowercase English letter. The count of the second element of `rev_array` in the rest of `rev_array` is calculated by `rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j])`, where `j` is 1. The index of the new element in `alp` is calculated by subtracting 1 from this count. The values of the other variables are not affected.
