The only variable in the loop head is variable `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `tc` must be greater than 1.
State: **`tc` is greater than 1 and decreased by 1, `stdin` contains (tc - 3) test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in `arr` such that the difference between them is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, otherwise 'Bob' is printed**
