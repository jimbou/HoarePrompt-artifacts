Output State: **`tc` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between the second and third elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or the difference between the first two elements of `arr` is not greater than 1, `stdin` contains (`tc` - 2) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2*10^5) and then `n` space-separated integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `dp` has been updated based on the difference between the second and third elements of `arr` and the previous value of `dp`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains (`tc` - 2) test cases.
