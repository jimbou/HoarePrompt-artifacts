Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `stdin` contains (tc - 2) test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` otherwise False, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `dp` has been updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Since `i` is 1, the condition becomes `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not dp`. If the difference between the first and second elements of `arr` is greater than 1, `dp` becomes True; otherwise, it becomes False. The other variables remain unchanged.
