Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n space-separated integers. It then sorts the integers in descending order, removes duplicates, and appends a 0 to the end of the list. The function checks if the difference between any two consecutive integers in the sorted list is greater than 1, and if so, prints 'Alice', otherwise it prints 'Bob'. The function repeats this process for each test case until all input has been processed, at which point the standard input is empty and the function terminates.**
