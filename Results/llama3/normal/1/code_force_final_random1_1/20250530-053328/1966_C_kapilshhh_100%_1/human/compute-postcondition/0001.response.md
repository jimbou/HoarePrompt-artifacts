The only variable in the loop head is variable `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, which already ensures that `tc` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`tc` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, stdin contains (tc - 1) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then n space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
