Output State: **tc is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, arr is a list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, dp is True, stdin contains (tc - 2) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then n space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `tc` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to be the length of the `arr` list minus one, which is the number of distinct integers in the input. The `arr` list is created by reading the input, removing duplicates, sorting the numbers in descending order, and appending a 0 at the end. The `dp` variable is set to True. The stdin now contains (tc - 2) test cases, as two test cases have been consumed by the code.
