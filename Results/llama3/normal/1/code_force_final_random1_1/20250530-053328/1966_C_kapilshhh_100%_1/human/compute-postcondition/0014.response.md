Output State: **tc is greater than 0, stdin contains (tc - 2) test cases, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, arr is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, dp is True, i is n.**

In this output state, the value of `tc` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `stdin` is reduced by 1 test case as the code consumes 1 test case. The value of `n` is updated to be an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, as it is assigned the value of the first input. The value of `arr` is updated to be a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, as it is assigned the sorted list of unique integers from the second input. The value of `dp` is set to True, as it is assigned True. The value of `i` is updated to be equal to `n`, as it is assigned the value of `n`.
