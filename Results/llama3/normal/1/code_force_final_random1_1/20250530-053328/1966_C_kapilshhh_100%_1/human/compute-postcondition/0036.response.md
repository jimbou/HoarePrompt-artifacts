Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `stdin` contains (`tc` - 3) test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is either True or False depending on whether any of `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` for `i` in range(1, n) or not, `i` is equal to `n`, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp` where 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `tc` has been decreased by 1, and the number of test cases in `stdin` has also been decreased by 1. The values of `n`, `arr`, `dp`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The printing of 'Alice' or 'Bob' still depends on the value of `dp`.
