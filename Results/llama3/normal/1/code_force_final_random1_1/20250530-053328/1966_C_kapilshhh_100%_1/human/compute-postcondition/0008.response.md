Output State: **`tc` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `arr` is a list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between the third and fourth elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or the difference between the second and third elements of `arr` is not greater than 1, `stdin` contains (`tc` - 2) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2*10^5) and then `n` space-separated integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `i` is 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tc` remains unchanged, `n` is still greater than 3, the list `arr` is still in descending order with a 0 at the end, and the value of `dp` is updated based on the difference between the third and fourth elements of `arr` and the difference between the second and third elements of `arr`. The input in `stdin` remains the same, with (`tc` - 2) test cases, each containing an integer `n` and `n` space-separated integers. The value of `i` is still 3.
