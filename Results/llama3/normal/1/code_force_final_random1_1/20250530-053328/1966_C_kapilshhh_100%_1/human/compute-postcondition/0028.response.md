Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `stdin` contains (`tc` - 4) test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is either True or False depending on whether `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` or not, `i` is 1, and 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, otherwise 'Bob' is printed**

In this output state, the value of `dp` has been updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Since `i` is 1, the condition becomes `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not dp`. The value of `dp` is now either True or False depending on whether this condition is met or not. The other variables remain unchanged.
