Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `stdin` contains (`tc` - 4) test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is either True or False depending on whether `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or not, `i` is 2, and 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, otherwise 'Bob' is printed**

In this output state, the value of `dp` has been updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`, where `i` is 2. The value of `dp` is now determined by whether `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or not. The other variables remain unchanged.
