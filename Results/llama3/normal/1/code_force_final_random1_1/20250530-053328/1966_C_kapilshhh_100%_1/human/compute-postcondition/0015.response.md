To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`). 

Since `i` is currently `n`, we need to adjust it to be 1, which is the starting value of the range. The state of `n` should be adjusted to be at least 2, to ensure the loop can execute.

The other variables `tc`, `stdin`, `arr`, and `dp` are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `stdin` contains (tc - 2) test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True, `i` is 1**
