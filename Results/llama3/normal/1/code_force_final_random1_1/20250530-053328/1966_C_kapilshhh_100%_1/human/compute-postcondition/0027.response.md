To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`tc` is greater than 1 and decreased by 1, `stdin` contains (`tc` - 4) test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True, `i` is 1, and 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, otherwise 'Bob' is printed**
