Output State: **`tc` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in `arr` (excluding the last element) whose difference is greater than 1, False otherwise, `stdin` contains (`tc` - 2) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2*10^5) and then `n` space-separated integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `i` is `n`**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- `tc` remains an integer between 1 and 2*10^5.
- `n` is now an integer greater than 0, since the loop iterates until `n-1`.
- `arr` remains a list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end.
- `dp` is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in `arr` (excluding the last element) whose difference is greater than 1, False otherwise. This is because the loop checks the difference between each pair of adjacent elements and updates `dp` accordingly.
- `stdin` remains unchanged, containing (`tc` - 2) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2*10^5) and then `n` space-separated integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9).
- `i` is now equal to `n`, since the loop iterates until `n-1`.
