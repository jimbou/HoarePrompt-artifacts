The code prints 'Alice' if the value of `dp` is True, otherwise it prints 'Bob'. The value of `dp` is True if any of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `arr` (excluding the first element) is greater than 1, otherwise it is False.
Output: **Alice if any of arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 for i in range(1, n) otherwise Bob**
