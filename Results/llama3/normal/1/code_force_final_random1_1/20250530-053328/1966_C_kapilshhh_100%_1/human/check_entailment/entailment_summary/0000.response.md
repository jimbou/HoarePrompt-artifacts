Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`) and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of piles (`n`) and the initial number of stones in each pile (`arr`).
3.  It sorts the array in descending order, removes duplicates, and appends a 0 to the end of the list. This is done to simplify the logic for determining the winner.
4.  The program then checks if the difference between any two consecutive integers in the sorted list is greater than 1. If it is, it means that Alice can make a move that will leave Bob with no valid moves, so Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.
5.  The program prints the winner of each test case based on the result of the check.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game.

Correctness: **True**
