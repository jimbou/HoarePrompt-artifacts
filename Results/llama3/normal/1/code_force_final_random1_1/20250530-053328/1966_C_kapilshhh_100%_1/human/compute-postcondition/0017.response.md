To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2*10^5.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `stdin` contains (tc - 2) test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` otherwise False, `i` is 2**
