Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tc is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, arr is a list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, dp is True, stdin contains (tc - 2) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then n space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between the first two elements of `arr` is greater than 1, False otherwise, `stdin` contains (`tc` - 2) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2*10^5) and then `n` space-separated integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tc` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between the second and third elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or the difference between the first two elements of `arr` is not greater than 1, `stdin` contains (`tc` - 2) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2*10^5) and then `n` space-separated integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `i` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tc` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `arr` is a list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between the third and fourth elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or the difference between the second and third elements of `arr` is not greater than 1, `stdin` contains (`tc` - 2) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2*10^5) and then `n` space-separated integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `i` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
