Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `stdin` contains (tc - 3) test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in `arr` such that the difference between them is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, otherwise 'Bob' is printed**

The code decrements the value of `tc` by 1, so the new value of `tc` is `tc - 1`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is also decreased by 1, so it now contains `(tc - 3)` test cases. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
