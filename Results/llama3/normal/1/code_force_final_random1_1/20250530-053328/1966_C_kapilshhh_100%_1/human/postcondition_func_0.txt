This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of unique integers. It then determines whether the difference between consecutive integers in the sorted list is greater than 1 at any point, and prints 'Alice' if this condition is met, or 'Bob' otherwise. The function continues to process test cases until all input has been read.
