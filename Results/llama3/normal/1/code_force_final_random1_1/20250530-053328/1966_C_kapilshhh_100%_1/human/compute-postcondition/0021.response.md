Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `stdin` contains (tc - 2) test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in `arr` such that the difference between them is greater than 1, `i` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `tc` remains greater than 0, `stdin` still contains `(tc - 2)` test cases, `n` remains an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, and `arr` remains a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end. The value of `dp` is determined by whether there exists a pair of adjacent elements in `arr` such that the difference between them is greater than 1. The loop counter `i` is 0 after the loop finishes executing.
