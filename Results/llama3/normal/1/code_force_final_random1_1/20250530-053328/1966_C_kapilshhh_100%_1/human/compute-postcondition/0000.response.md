Output State: **`tc` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, stdin contains (tc - 1) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then n space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, `tc` is assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5. The remaining test cases in stdin are reduced by 1, as one test case has been read. Each of the remaining test cases still contains two inputs: an integer n and n space-separated integers.
