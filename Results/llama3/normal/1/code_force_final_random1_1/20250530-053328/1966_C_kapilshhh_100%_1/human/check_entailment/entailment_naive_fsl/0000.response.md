Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the dp variable. The dp variable is set to True initially and then updated based on the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual game strategy.

A correct approach would be to calculate the Nim-sum of the array elements, which is the XOR of all the elements. If the Nim-sum is not zero, then Alice can win the game by making moves that maintain the Nim-sum. If the Nim-sum is zero, then Bob can win the game by mirroring Alice's moves.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work correctly:

Input:

    1
    3
    1 2 4

The program will output "Bob", but the correct output should be "Alice". This is because Alice can win the game by removing 1 stone from the first pile, then Bob will be forced to remove 1 stone from the second pile, and then Alice can remove 1 stone from the third pile, winning the game.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
