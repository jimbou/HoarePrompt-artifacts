Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `stdin` contains (tc - 2) test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or `arr[1] - arr[2] <= 1`, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `dp` has been updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Since `i` is 2, the condition checks if `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or if `arr[1] - arr[2] <= 1` (which is the negation of the original value of `dp`). The other variables remain unchanged.
