Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `stdin` contains (`tc` - 4) test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is either True or False depending on whether any of `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` for `i` in range(1, n) or not, `i` is equal to `n`, and 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, otherwise 'Bob' is printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

- The value of `tc` is decreased by 1, but it remains greater than 0.
- The number of test cases in `stdin` remains (`tc` - 4).
- The value of `n` remains the same, but since the loop iterates from 1 to `n`, it is now an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5.
- The list `arr` remains a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end.
- The value of `dp` is determined by whether any of the differences `arr[i] - arr[i + 1]` for `i` in range(1, n) are greater than 1. If any of these differences are greater than 1, `dp` is True; otherwise, it is False.
- The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, since the loop iterates from 1 to `n`.
- Finally, 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, and 'Bob' is printed if `dp` is False.
