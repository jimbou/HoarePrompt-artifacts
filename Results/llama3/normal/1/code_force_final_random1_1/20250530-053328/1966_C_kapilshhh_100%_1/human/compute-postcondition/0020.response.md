Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `stdin` contains (tc - 2) test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1` or `arr[2] - arr[3] <= 1`, `i` is 3**

The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`, where `i` is 3. This means that `dp` is now True if `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1` or `arr[2] - arr[3] <= 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
