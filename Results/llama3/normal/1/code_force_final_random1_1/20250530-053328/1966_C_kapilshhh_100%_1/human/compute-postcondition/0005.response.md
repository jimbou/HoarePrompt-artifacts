To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is already greater than 1, it remains the same.

State: **`tc` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between the first two elements of `arr` is greater than 1, False otherwise, `stdin` contains (`tc` - 2) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2*10^5) and then `n` space-separated integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `i` is 2**
