Output State: **tc is greater than 1 and decreased by 1, stdin contains (tc - 4) test cases, n is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2*10^5, arr is a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, dp is True, i is 0, and 'Alice' is printed if dp is True, otherwise 'Bob' is printed**

In this output state, the value of `tc` has been decreased by 1, and the number of test cases in `stdin` has also been reduced by 1. The value of `n` has been updated to be the length of the list `arr` minus 1. The list `arr` has been updated to be a sorted list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end. The value of `dp` has been set to True. The value of `i` remains 0. The output state also includes the information that 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.
