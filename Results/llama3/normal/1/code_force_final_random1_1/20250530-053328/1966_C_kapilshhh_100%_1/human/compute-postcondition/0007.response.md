The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`tc` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `arr` is a list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between the second and third elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or the difference between the first two elements of `arr` is not greater than 1, `stdin` contains (`tc` - 2) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2*10^5) and then `n` space-separated integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `i` is 3**
