Output: **`tc` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of distinct integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in `arr` (excluding the last element) whose difference is greater than 1, False otherwise, `stdin` contains (`tc` - 2) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2*10^5) and then `n` space-separated integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `i` is `n`, and 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, otherwise 'Bob' is printed**
