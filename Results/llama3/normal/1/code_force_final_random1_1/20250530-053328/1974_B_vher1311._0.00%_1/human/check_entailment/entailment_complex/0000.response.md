Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the encoded string `b` and return the original string `s`. However, the function does not actually perform any decoding operation. Instead, it constructs a list of unique characters from the input string `s` (not `b`) and returns this list as a string.

The function seems to be a mix of encoding and decoding operations. The first part of the function replaces each character in the string `s` with the character at the corresponding index in the sorted list of unique characters, which is an encoding operation. However, this operation is not actually performed on the input string `b`, but rather on the original string `s`, which is not available in the decoding function.

The second part of the function constructs a list of unique characters from the input string `s` and returns this list as a string, which is not the correct decoding operation.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
