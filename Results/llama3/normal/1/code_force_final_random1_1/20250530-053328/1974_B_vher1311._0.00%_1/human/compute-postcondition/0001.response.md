According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s. If the string s has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, unique_chars is a list of unique characters from s in sorted order, i is 0, j is the index of the last character in unique_chars. So for the loop to be executed, the string s must have at least 1 character and char is the first character in the string s.
State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, unique_chars is a list of unique characters from s in sorted order, i is 0, j is the index of the last character in unique_chars, char is the first character in the string s**
