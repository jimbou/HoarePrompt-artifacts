Postcondition: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of its original first three characters replaced by the character at the original index j in unique_chars if the first three characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise s remains unchanged. unique_chars is a list of unique characters from the original string s in sorted order. If char is in unique_chars, then s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of its original third character replaced by the character at the original index j-1 in unique_chars if the first three characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise s remains unchanged. j is the original index of the last character in unique_chars minus 4 if the first three characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise j is the index of the last character in unique_chars minus 3. If char is not in unique_chars, then s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of its original first three characters replaced by the character at the original index j in unique_chars if the first three characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise s remains unchanged. unique_chars is a list of unique characters from the original string s in sorted order with char inserted at index i. j is the original index of the last character in unique_chars plus 1 if the first three characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise j is the index of the last character in unique_chars plus 3. char is the third character in the original string s. i is 0 if the first three characters of s are in unique_chars and char is in unique_chars, otherwise i is 1 if the first three characters of s are in unique_chars and char is not in unique_chars, otherwise i is 2 if the first three characters of s are not in unique_chars and char is in unique_chars, otherwise i is 3 if the first three characters of s are not in unique_chars and char is not in unique_chars.**
