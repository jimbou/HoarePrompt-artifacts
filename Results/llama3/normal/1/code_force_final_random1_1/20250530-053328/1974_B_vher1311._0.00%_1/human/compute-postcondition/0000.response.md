Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, unique_chars is a list of unique characters from s in sorted order, i is 0, j is the index of the last character in unique_chars**.

The code first creates a set of unique characters from the string `s`, then converts this set into a list and sorts it. This sorted list is assigned to the variable `unique_chars`. The length of `unique_chars` is the number of unique characters in `s`. The variables `i` and `j` are then initialized to the first and last indices of `unique_chars`, respectively.
