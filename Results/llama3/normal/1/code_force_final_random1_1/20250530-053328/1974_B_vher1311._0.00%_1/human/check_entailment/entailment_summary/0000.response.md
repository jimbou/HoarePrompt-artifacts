Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The function is supposed to replace each character in the input string `b` with its symmetric character from the string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of `b` in alphabetical order. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement this replacement. It replaces each character in `b` with the character at the corresponding index in the sorted list of unique characters, which is not the correct decoding algorithm.

Moreover, the function `func_1` modifies the input string `s` in place, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The function should return a new string that is the decoded version of the input string `b`.

Correctness: **False**
