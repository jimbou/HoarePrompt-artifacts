Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, unique_chars is a list of unique characters from s in sorted order, i is 1, j is the index of the last character in unique_chars, char is the first character in the string s, and char is in unique_chars**

The code block modifies the initial state by inserting the character `char` into the `unique_chars` list at index `i`, incrementing `i` by 1, and incrementing `j` by 1. As a result, `char` is now included in `unique_chars`, and `i` and `j` are updated to reflect the new length of the list. The string `s` remains unchanged.
