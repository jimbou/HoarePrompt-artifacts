Output State: **The program returns a string that consists of unique characters from the original string s in sorted order.**

This output state is a string because the `join()` function is used to concatenate the elements of the `unique_chars` list into a single string. The characters in this string are unique because `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from the original string `s`. The characters are also in sorted order because the `unique_chars` list is sorted.
