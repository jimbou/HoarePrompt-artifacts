Functionality: This function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input and returns a string consisting of unique characters from the original string in sorted order. If all characters in the input string are unique, the function replaces each character with the character at the corresponding index in the sorted list of unique characters. If the input string contains duplicate characters, the function leaves the string unchanged. The function also maintains a list of unique characters from the original string in sorted order and updates indices to track the position of characters in this list.
