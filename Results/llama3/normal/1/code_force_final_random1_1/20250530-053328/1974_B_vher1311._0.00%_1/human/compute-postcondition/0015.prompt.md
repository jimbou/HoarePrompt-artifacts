Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, unique_chars is a list of unique characters from s in sorted order, i is 0, j is the index of the last character in unique_chars
Code of the loop:
for char in s:
    if char in unique_chars:
        s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
        j -= 1
    else:
        unique_chars.insert(i, char)
        i += 1
        j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of its original first character replaced by the character at the original index j in unique_chars if the first character of s is in unique_chars, otherwise s remains unchanged. unique_chars is a list of unique characters from the original string s in sorted order. i is 0 if the first character of s is in unique_chars, otherwise i is 1. j is the original index of the last character in unique_chars minus 1 if the first character of s is in unique_chars, otherwise j is the index of the last character in unique_chars. char is the first character in the original string s.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of its original first two characters replaced by the character at the original index j in unique_chars if the first two characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise s remains unchanged. unique_chars is a list of unique characters from the original string s in sorted order. If char is in unique_chars, then j is the original index of the last character in unique_chars minus 2 if the first two characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise j is the index of the last character in unique_chars minus 1. If char is not in unique_chars, then char is inserted at index i in unique_chars, and j is the original index of the last character in unique_chars if the first two characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise j is the index of the last character in unique_chars plus 1. i is 0 if the first two characters of s are in unique_chars and char is in unique_chars, otherwise i is 1 if the first two characters of s are in unique_chars and char is not in unique_chars, otherwise i is 2 if the first two characters of s are not in unique_chars and char is in unique_chars, otherwise i is 3. char is the second character in the original string s.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of its original first three characters replaced by the character at the original index j in unique_chars if the first three characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise s remains unchanged. unique_chars is a list of unique characters from the original string s in sorted order. If char is in unique_chars, then s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of its original third character replaced by the character at the original index j-1 in unique_chars if the first three characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise s remains unchanged. j is the original index of the last character in unique_chars minus 4 if the first three characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise j is the index of the last character in unique_chars minus 3. If char is not in unique_chars, then s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of its original first three characters replaced by the character at the original index j in unique_chars if the first three characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise s remains unchanged. unique_chars is a list of unique characters from the original string s in sorted order with char inserted at index i. j is the original index of the last character in unique_chars plus 1 if the first three characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise j is the index of the last character in unique_chars plus 3. char is the third character in the original string s. i is 0 if the first three characters of s are in unique_chars and char is in unique_chars, otherwise i is 1 if the first three characters of s are in unique_chars and char is not in unique_chars, otherwise i is 2 if the first three characters of s are not in unique_chars and char is in unique_chars, otherwise i is 3 if the first three characters of s are not in unique_chars and char is not in unique_chars.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
