Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1(b)` is supposed to decode the encoded string `b` and return the original string `s`. However, the provided implementation of `func_1(b)` does not perform the decoding correctly.

The function first creates a list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` in sorted order. Then, it iterates over the characters in the encoded string `b`. If a character is in the list of unique characters, it replaces all occurrences of that character in the encoded string `b` with the character at the corresponding index `j` in the list of unique characters. If a character is not in the list of unique characters, it inserts the character at the beginning of the list of unique characters and increments the index `j`.

However, this implementation does not correctly reverse the encoding process. The encoding process replaces each character in the original string `s` with its symmetric character from the list of unique characters. To decode the string, we need to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric character from the list of unique characters.

The correct implementation of `func_1(b)` should create a list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` in sorted order, and then iterate over the characters in the encoded string `b`. For each character, it should find its symmetric character in the list of unique characters and replace all occurrences of the character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric character.

Correctness: **False**
