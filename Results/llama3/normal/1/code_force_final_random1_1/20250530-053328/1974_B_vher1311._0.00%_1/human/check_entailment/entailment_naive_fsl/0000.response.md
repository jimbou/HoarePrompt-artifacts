Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is trying to replace each character in the input string `s` with its symmetric character from the string `unique_chars`, but it is doing so in a way that modifies the original string `s` and also modifies the list `unique_chars` in place. This leads to incorrect results because the replacements are not done correctly.

For example, if the input string is "serofedsoc", the function `func_1` will first replace 's' with 'c', then replace 'e' with 'f', and so on. However, when it tries to replace 'c' with 's', it will replace the 'c' that was previously replaced with 'f', not the original 'c'. This will result in an incorrect output.

A correct implementation of the decoding algorithm would involve creating a new string where each character is replaced with its symmetric character from the string `unique_chars`, without modifying the original string or the list `unique_chars`.
