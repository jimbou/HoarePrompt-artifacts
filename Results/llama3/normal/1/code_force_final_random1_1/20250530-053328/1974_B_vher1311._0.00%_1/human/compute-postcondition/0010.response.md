Postcondition: ***s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of its original first two characters replaced by the character at the original index j in unique_chars if the first two characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise s remains unchanged. unique_chars is a list of unique characters from the original string s in sorted order. If char is in unique_chars, then j is the original index of the last character in unique_chars minus 2 if the first two characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise j is the index of the last character in unique_chars minus 1. If char is not in unique_chars, then char is inserted at index i in unique_chars, and j is the original index of the last character in unique_chars if the first two characters of s are in unique_chars, otherwise j is the index of the last character in unique_chars plus 1. i is 0 if the first two characters of s are in unique_chars and char is in unique_chars, otherwise i is 1 if the first two characters of s are in unique_chars and char is not in unique_chars, otherwise i is 2 if the first two characters of s are not in unique_chars and char is in unique_chars, otherwise i is 3. char is the second character in the original string s.***
