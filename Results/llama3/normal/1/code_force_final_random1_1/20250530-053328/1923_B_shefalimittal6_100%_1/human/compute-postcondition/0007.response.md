To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to understand the function `func_1(a, x, k)` and its return value based on the inputs `a`, `x`, and `k`. However, the definition of `func_1` is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet.

Given the information provided:

- `n` is an integer.
- `k` is an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers with a length of `n`.
- `x` is a list of integers with a length of `n`.
- `stdin` contains no input.

Without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot precisely determine what condition it checks or how it uses the inputs `a`, `x`, and `k`. Therefore, we cannot accurately predict whether `func_1(a, x, k)` will return `True` or `False`.

However, based on the structure of the print statement, we can describe the possible outputs:

- If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, the print statement will output `'YES'`.
- If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `False`, the print statement will output `'NO'`.

Since we lack the specific details of what `func_1` does with `a`, `x`, and `k`, we cannot provide a more precise description of the output based on the values of `a`, `x`, and `k`.

Output: **'YES' if func_1(a, x, k) returns True, 'NO' if func_1(a, x, k) returns False**
