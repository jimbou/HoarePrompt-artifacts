Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, x is a list of integers, len(a) = len(x) = n, stdin contains no input, t is greater than 1, 'YES' if func_1(a, x, k) returns True, otherwise 'NO'**

The code snippet reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Then, it reads two lists of integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `x`, respectively. The length of both lists `a` and `x` is equal to `n`. The code does not modify the value of `t`, which remains greater than 1. The function `func_1(a, x, k)` is not defined in the given code snippet, so its return value is unknown. However, based on the precondition, it is printed 'YES' if `func_1(a, x, k)` returns True, otherwise 'NO'.
