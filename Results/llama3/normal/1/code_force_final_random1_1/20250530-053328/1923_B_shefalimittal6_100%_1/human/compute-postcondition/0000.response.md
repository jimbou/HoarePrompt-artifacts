Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `x` is a list of non-zero integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, `t` is an integer, `len(a)` = `len(x)` = `n`, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `x`, and `k` remain unchanged. The variable `t` is assigned an integer value from the input, which is now empty. The length of `a` and `x` is still `n`.
