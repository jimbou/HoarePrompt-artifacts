To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, we need to understand the function `func_1(a, x, k)` and its return value based on the given precondition.

The precondition states that `a` is a list of integers, `x` is a list of integers, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `len(a) = len(x) = n`, and `stdin` contains no input.

However, the precondition does not provide the definition of the function `func_1(a, x, k)`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact output of the print statement without knowing what the function `func_1(a, x, k)` does.

If we assume that the function `func_1(a, x, k)` returns a boolean value (True or False) based on some condition involving the lists `a` and `x` and the integer `k`, then the print statement will print either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the return value of the function.

Output: **'YES' if func_1(a, x, k) returns True, 'NO' if func_1(a, x, k) returns False**
