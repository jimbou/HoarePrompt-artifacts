Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid and arrow directions.

The program iterates over the columns of the grid in steps of 2, starting from the second column (index 1). For each column, it checks if the arrow directions in the current column and the next column (or the previous column) are both '<'. If this condition is true, it means that the robot cannot move to the right and is stuck in the current column, so it prints 'No' and breaks the loop.

If the loop completes without finding any such columns, it means that the robot can reach the cell (2, n), so it prints 'yes'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when n is 2, and it correctly prints 'yes' or 'No' based on the input.

Correctness: **True**
