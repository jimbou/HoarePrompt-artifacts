The code accepts an input and assigns it to `t` after converting it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even), then two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. The first input is accepted and assigned to `t`. So stdin now contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even), then two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even), then two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'**
