Output State: **`t` is an integer that is at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `i` is still 1, and the conditions regarding the characters at indices `i` and `i + 1` in `a` and `b` are still valid. The program execution will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement that was broken out of.
