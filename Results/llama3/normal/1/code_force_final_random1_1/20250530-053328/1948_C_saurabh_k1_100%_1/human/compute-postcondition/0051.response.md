Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer that is at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is the current value plus 2. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', then 'No' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
