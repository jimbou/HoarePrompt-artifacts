Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 5 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive and is even, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3, 'No' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, the value of `_` is still 0, the value of `n` is still an integer between 5 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive and is even, the value of `a` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', the value of `b` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', the value of `stdin` is still multiple test cases minus one, the value of `i` is still 3, 'No' is still printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
