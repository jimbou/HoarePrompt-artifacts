Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid and arrow directions. The program checks for the condition where the robot cannot move further, i.e., when it encounters a pair of adjacent '<' characters in the two rows. If such a condition is found, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'yes'. The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
