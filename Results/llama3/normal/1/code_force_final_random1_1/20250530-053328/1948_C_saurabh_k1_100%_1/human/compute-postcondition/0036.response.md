Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is an integer greater than 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `i + 2` from the previous iteration, the string 'No' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means that the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement.
