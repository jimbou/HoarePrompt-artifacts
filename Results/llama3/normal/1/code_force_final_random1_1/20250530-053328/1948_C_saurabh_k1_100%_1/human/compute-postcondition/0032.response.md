Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three. If `i` plus 1 is less than `n` and either `a[i]` equals `b[i + 1]` equals '<' or `a[i]` equals `b[i - 1]` equals '<', then the string 'No' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.**
