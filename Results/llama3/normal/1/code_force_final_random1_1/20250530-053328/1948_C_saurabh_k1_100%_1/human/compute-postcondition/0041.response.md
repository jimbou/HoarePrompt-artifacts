To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 and odd, and `i` is within the range of 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2.

Since `n` is already given as an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure it falls within the range of the loop.

The loop starts from 1 and increments by 2, so the first value of `i` should be 1. Therefore, we adjust the state of `i` to be 1.

The other variables `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `stdin` are not directly related to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust their states.

State: **`t` is an integer that is at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1**
