To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue executing.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n, 2):`, which means that `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer greater than 1, and `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is an integer greater than 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `i + 2` from the previous iteration**
