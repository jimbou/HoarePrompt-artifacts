Output State: **`t` is an integer that is at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is the current value plus 2, 'No' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'No' is printed.
