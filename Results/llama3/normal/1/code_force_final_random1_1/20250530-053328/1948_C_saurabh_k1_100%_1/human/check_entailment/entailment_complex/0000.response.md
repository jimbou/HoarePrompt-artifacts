Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) in the grid.

The program iterates over the columns of the grid in steps of 2, starting from the second column (index 1). For each column, it checks if the current cell in the first row and the next cell in the second row are both '<', or if the current cell in the first row and the previous cell in the second row are both '<'. If either of these conditions is true, it means that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) and the program prints 'No'.

If the program iterates over all columns without finding any such pair of cells, it means that the robot can reach the cell (2, n) and the program prints 'yes'.

The program correctly handles the constraints on the input, including the fact that n is even and that there are no arrows pointing outside the grid.

Correctness: **True**
