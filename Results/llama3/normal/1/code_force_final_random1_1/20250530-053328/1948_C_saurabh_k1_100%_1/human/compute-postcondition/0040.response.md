Output State: **t is an integer that is at least 2, _ is 2, n is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, a is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is n - 1.**

The code block consists of three lines, each of which assigns a value to a variable. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was previously an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, it will still be an integer, but its value may change. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `a`. Since `a` was previously a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', it will still be a string, but its length and contents may change. The third line assigns the string value of the input to `b`. Since `b` was previously a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', it will still be a string, but its length and contents may change.

The value of `t` is not affected by the code block, so it remains an integer that is at least 2. The value of `_` is also not affected, so it remains 2. The value of `i` is not affected, so it remains `n - 1`. The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by three, since three inputs are read.
