Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive and is even, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n`. Additionally, either the current character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` are both '<', or the current character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` are both '<'. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement and 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and 'No' is printed. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
