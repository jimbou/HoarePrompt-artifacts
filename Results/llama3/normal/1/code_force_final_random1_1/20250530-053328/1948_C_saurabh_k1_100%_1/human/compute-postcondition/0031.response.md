Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the string 'No' is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the string 'No' is still being printed.
