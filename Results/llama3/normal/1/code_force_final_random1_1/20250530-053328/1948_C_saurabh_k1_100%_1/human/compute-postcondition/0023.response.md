Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n`. The current value of `a` at index `i` and `b` at index `i + 1` are both '<', or the current value of `a` at index `i` and `b` at index `i - 1` are both '<'.**
