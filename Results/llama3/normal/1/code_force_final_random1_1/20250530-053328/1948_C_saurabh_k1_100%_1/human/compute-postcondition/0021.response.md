Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive and is even, a is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is n - 1**

The code block reads three lines from stdin: an integer `n`, and two strings `a` and `b`. The value of `n` is assigned to the variable `n`, overwriting its previous value. The strings `a` and `b` are assigned to the variables `a` and `b`, respectively. The variable `i` remains unchanged, still equal to `n - 1`. The variable `t` and `_` also remain unchanged. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three.
