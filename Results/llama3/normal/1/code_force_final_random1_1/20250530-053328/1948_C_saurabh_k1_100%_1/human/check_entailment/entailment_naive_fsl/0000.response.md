Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

```
1
6
>><<><
><>>><
```

The program will print "yes", but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 6) because the arrows in the first row are pointing to the left, and the robot cannot move to the right.

The program only checks if there are any pairs of arrows pointing to the left in the same column, but it does not consider the overall path that the robot can take. It does not check if the robot can actually reach the cell (2, n) by following the arrows.

To fix this, the program needs to simulate the robot's movement and check if it can reach the cell (2, n) by following the arrows.
