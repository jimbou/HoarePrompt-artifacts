Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive and is even, a is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1. If i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<', then 'No' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `i` has reached `n - 1`, which is the last index of the strings `a` and `b`. If the condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is true, the program prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues to execute, and since this is the last iteration, the loop will terminate. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
