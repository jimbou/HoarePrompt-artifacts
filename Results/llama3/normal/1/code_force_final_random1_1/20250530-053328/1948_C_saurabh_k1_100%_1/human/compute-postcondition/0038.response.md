Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is `n - 1`. If `i` plus 1 is less than `n` and either `a[i]` equals `b[i + 1]` equals '<' or `a[i]` equals `b[i - 1]` equals '<', then the string 'No' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the string 'yes' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has checked all pairs of adjacent characters in strings `a` and `b` that are at even indices. If any pair of adjacent characters in `a` and `b` are both '<', the loop prints 'No' and breaks. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, the loop prints 'yes'. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `stdin` remain unchanged, and `i` is now `n - 1`.
