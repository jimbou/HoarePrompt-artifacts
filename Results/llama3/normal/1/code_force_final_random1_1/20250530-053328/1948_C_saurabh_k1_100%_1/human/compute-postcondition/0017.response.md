Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 7 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive and is even, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 5, 'No' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by one. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The 'No' that was printed remains printed.
