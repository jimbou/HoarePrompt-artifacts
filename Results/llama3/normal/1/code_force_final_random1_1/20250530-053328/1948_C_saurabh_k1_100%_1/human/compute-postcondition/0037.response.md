Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is an integer greater than 1 and less than `n`, `i` is equal to `i + 2` from the previous iteration. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then the string 'No' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration.***
