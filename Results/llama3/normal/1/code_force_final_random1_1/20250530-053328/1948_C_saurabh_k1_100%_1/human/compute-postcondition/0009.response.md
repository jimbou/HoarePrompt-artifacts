The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive and is even. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 2 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 5 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive and is even, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3**
