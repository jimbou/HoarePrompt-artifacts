Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is t, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive and is even, a is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', stdin contains no test cases, i is n - 1. If for all i in range(1, n, 2), neither a[i] and b[i + 1] are both '<' nor a[i] and b[i - 1] are both '<', then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t will be greater than or equal to 0, the variable _ will be equal to t, the variable n will be an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive and will be even, the variable a will be a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', the variable b will be a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', stdin will contain no test cases, and the variable i will be n - 1. If for all i in range(1, n, 2), neither a[i] and b[i + 1] are both '<' nor a[i] and b[i - 1] are both '<', then 'yes' will be printed. Otherwise, 'No' will be printed.
