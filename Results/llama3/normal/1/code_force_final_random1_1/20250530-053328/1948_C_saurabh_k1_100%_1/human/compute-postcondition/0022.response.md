The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n - 1` which is an odd number, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1. Also, `n` is an even number between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 3 and is an odd number.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1**
