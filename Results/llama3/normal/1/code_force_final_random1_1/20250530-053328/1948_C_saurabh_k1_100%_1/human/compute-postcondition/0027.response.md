Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three. If `i` + 1 < `n` and `a[i]` == `b[i + 1]` == '<' or `a[i]` == `b[i - 1]` == '<', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
