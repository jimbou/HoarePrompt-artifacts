Output State: **t is an integer that is at least 2, _ is 2, n is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, a is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', b is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is n - 1. If for all i in range(1, n, 2), neither a[i] and b[i + 1] are both '<' nor a[i] and b[i - 1] are both '<', then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the addition of a printed message. If the loop completes without finding any pair of adjacent characters in strings `a` and `b` that are both '<', it will print 'yes'. Otherwise, it will print 'No'. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `stdin` remain unchanged, and `i` will be set to `n - 1`.
