This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an even integer n and two strings a and b of length n containing '<' and/or '>'. It then checks if there are any pairs of adjacent characters in a and b that are both '<'. If such a pair is found, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'yes'. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.
