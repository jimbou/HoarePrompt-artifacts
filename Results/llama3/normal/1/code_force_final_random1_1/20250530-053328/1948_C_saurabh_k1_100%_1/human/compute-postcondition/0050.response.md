Output State: **`t` is an integer that is at least 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is the current value plus 2, and 'No' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the program will exit the current loop or conditional block. The 'No' that was being printed is still being printed.
