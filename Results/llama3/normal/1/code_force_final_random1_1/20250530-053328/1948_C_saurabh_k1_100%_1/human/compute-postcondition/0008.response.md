Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive and is even, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1. If `i + 1` is less than `n` and either the current character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` are both '<', or the current character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` are both '<', then 'No' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement.***
