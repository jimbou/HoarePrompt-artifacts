Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that is at least 3 and is odd, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
