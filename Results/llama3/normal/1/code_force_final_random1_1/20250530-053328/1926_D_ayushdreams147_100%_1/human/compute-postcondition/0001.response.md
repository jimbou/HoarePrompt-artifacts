According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list has at least 1 number the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, res is 0, count is an empty dictionary, and n is a positive integer. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 number and the num is the first number in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^31 that must have at least 1 number, `res` is 0, `count` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first number in the list**
