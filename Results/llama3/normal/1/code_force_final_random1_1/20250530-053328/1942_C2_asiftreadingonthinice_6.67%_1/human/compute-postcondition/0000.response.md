Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the value of `tt` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, as one test case has been read and processed. The rest of the test cases remain unchanged, with each test case consisting of two lines: the first line contains three integers n, x, and y, and the second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
