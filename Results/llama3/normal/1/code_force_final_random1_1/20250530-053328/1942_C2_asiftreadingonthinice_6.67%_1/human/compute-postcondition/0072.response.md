Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is either `x` + `y` - 1 or `x` + `y` - 2, `tmp` is either an empty list or a list containing half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`, `i` is 1, `ii` is not defined, `tt` is not defined, `stdin` is empty. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is 2, then `ans` is `x` + `y` - 1. If the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `ans` is increased by half of this difference, and `tmp` contains half of this difference. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
