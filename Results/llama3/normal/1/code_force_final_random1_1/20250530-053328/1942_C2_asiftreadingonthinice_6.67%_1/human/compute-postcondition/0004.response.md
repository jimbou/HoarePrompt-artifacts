Postcondition: **`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 2, `tmp` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `tt` - 2 test cases, `i` is 1. The current value of `a[i]` minus `a[i - 1]` equals 2.**
