Postcondition: **`ans`, `y`, `tmp` are updated, `i` is 3, `a` has at least 4 elements. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `ans`, `y`, and `tmp` are updated by half of this difference, half of this difference minus 1, and half of this difference respectively.**
