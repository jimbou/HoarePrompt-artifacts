Postcondition: **tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains tt - 2 test cases, i is equal to the length of a, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a with a difference of 2 plus the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1, tmp is a list containing half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1. The difference between the first element of a and the last element of a plus n is not equal to 2. The current value of y is greater than half of the difference between the current element of a and the previous element of a minus 1. The difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a is even.**
