Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the difference between the current element of a and the previous element of a plus 1 if the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a minus 1, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains tt - 3 test cases, i is equal to the length of a, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a with a difference of 2 plus the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1 plus y plus 1 if the first element of a plus n minus the last element of a equals 2, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a with a difference of 2 plus the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1 plus half of the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a if the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a minus 1, tmp is a list containing half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1 plus half of the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a if the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a minus 1, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program updates the values of `ans`, `y`, and `tmp` based on the difference between the current element of `a` and the previous element of `a`. If the difference is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference minus 1, `y` is updated to its original value minus half of the difference between the current element of `a` and the previous element of `a` plus 1 minus half of the difference between the current element of `a` and the previous element of `a` minus 1, and `tmp` is updated to contain half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with an even difference and `y` greater than half of the difference minus 1 plus half of the difference between the current element of `a` and the previous element of `a`. The minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans`, `y`, `tmp` are updated, `i` is 2, `a` has at least 3 elements. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1, `y` is updated, `tmp` is updated. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `ans` is increased by half of the difference, `y` is decreased by half of the difference plus 1, and `tmp` is extended with half of the difference. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans`, `y`, `tmp` are updated, `i` is 3, `a` has at least 4 elements. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1, `y` is updated, `tmp` is updated. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `ans`, `y`, and `tmp` are updated by half of this difference, half of this difference minus 1, and half of this difference respectively.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
