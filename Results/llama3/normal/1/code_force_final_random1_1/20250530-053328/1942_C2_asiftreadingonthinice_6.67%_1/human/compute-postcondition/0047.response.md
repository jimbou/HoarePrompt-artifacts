The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `a` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least 4 elements.
State: **`ans`, `y`, `tmp` are updated, `i` is 3, `a` has at least 4 elements.**
