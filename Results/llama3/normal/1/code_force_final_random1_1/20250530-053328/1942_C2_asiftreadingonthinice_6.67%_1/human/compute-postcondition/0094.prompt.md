Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]
        ) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the difference between the current element of `a` and the previous element of `a` plus 1 if the difference between the first element of `a`, `n` and the last element of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference between the first element of `a`, `n` and the last element of `a` minus 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains `tt - 2` test cases, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with a difference of 2 plus the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with an even difference and `y` greater than half of the difference minus 1 plus `y` plus 1 if the first element of `a` plus `n` minus the last element of `a` equals 2, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with a difference of 2 plus the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with an even difference and `y` greater than half of the difference minus 1 plus half of the difference between the first element of `a`, `n` and the last element of `a` if the difference between the first element of `a`, `n` and the last element of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference between the first element of `a`, `n` and the last element of `a` minus 1, `tmp` is a list containing half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with an even difference and `y` greater than half of the difference minus 1 plus half of the difference between the first element of `a`, `n` and the last element of `a` if the difference between the first element of `a`, `n` and the last element of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference between the first element of `a`, `n` and the last element of `a` minus 1, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is the sum of `x` + `y` - 2, the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with a difference of 2, and the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with an even difference and `y` greater than half of the difference minus 1. If the difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a`, minus `n`, is equal to 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a`, minus `n`, is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` minus 1, then `ans` is increased by half of the difference between `a[0]` and `a[len(a) - 1]` plus `n`, plus half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, `y` is decreased by half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` plus 1, and `tmp` is increased by half of the difference between `a[0]` and `a[len(a) - 1]` plus `n`. `y` is its original value minus the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with an even difference and `y` greater than half of the difference minus 1, plus `y`. `tmp` contains half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with an even difference and `y` greater than half of the difference minus 1. `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ii` is not defined, `tt` is not defined, `stdin` is empty. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is `x` + `y` plus the sum of all the even differences between consecutive elements in `a` divided by 2 plus 1, and `tmp` is a list containing half of all the even differences between consecutive elements in `a`. Otherwise, if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference between the last two elements of `a` minus 1, then `y` is updated to its original value minus half of the difference between the last two elements of `a` plus 1, `ans` is updated to `x` + `y` plus the sum of all the even differences between consecutive elements in `a` divided by 2 plus half of the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a`, and `tmp` is updated to a list containing half of all the even differences between consecutive elements in `a` plus half of the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans` plus `y`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
