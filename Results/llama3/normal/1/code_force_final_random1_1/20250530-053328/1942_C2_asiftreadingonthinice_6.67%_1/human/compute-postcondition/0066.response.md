Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x` + `y` - 2, `tmp` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `ii` is not defined, `tt` is not defined, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `i` is 1 and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is 2.***
