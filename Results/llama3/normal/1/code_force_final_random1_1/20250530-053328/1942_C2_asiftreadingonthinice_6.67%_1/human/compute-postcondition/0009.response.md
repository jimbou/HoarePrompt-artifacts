Postcondition: ***`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 2, `tmp` is a list, `stdin` contains `tt` - 2 test cases, `i` is 1, and the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is not equal to 2. If the difference between the current element of `a` and the previous element of `a` is even and the current value of `y` is greater than half of the difference between the current element of `a` and the previous element of `a` minus 1, then `ans` is increased by half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` and `tmp` contains half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`.***
