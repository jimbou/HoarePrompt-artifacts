Postcondition: ***`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains `tt` - 2 test cases, `i` is 3. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `y` is decreased by half of this difference minus 1, a temporary list `tmp` is created with one element equal to half of this difference, and `ans` is set to half of this difference. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
