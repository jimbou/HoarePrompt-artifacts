Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2, tmp is an empty list, stdin contains tt - 2 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains `tt` - 2 test cases, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` equals 2, then `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 1 and `tmp` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 2 and `tmp` is a list. If the difference between the current element of `a` and the previous element of `a` is even and the current value of `y` is greater than half of the difference between the current element of `a` and the previous element of `a` minus 1, then `ans` is increased by half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` and `tmp` contains half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains `tt` - 2 test cases, `i` is 2. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[2] - a[1])` is even and `y` is larger than `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is decreased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`, `tmp` is a list containing `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `ans` is `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains `tt` - 2 test cases, `i` is 3. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `y` is decreased by half of this difference minus 1, a temporary list `tmp` is created with one element equal to half of this difference, and `ans` is set to half of this difference. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
