To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects in it.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The length of `a` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is either `x` + `y` - 1 or `x` + `y` - 2, `tmp` is either an empty list or a list containing half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`, `i` is 2, `ii` is not defined, `tt` is not defined, `stdin` is empty.**
