Postcondition: **ans is the sum of x + y - 2, the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a with a difference of 2, and the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1, y is its original value minus the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1, tmp contains half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1, and i is equal to the length of a. The current value of ans, y, tmp, and i are updated based on the previous conditions. Additionally, the difference between the first element of a and the last element of a, minus n, is equal to 2.**
