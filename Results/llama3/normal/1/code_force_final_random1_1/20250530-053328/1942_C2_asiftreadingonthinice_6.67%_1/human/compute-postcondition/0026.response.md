Output State: **tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains tt - 2 test cases, i is equal to the length of a, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a with a difference of 2 plus the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1 plus half of the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a, tmp is a list containing half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1 plus half of the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a, y is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the difference between the current element of a and the previous element of a plus 1.**

The code adds half of the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a to tmp. It also adds half of the difference between the current element of a and the previous element of a to ans. Finally, it subtracts half of the difference between the current element of a and the previous element of a minus 1 from y.
