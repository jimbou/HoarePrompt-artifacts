Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (x) is equal to the number of sides of the polygon (n). In this case, the program will output 0, but the correct answer should be n-2, because all vertices are already chosen and we can form n-2 triangles by connecting each vertex with its two neighbors.

For example, if the input is:

3
4 4 0
1 2 3 4

The program will output 0, but the correct answer is 2.
