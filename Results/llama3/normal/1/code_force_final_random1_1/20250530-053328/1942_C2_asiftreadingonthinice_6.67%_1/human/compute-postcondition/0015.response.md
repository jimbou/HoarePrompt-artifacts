Postcondition: ***`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains `tt` - 2 test cases, `i` is 2. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[2] - a[1])` is even and `y` is larger than `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is decreased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`, `tmp` is a list containing `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `ans` is `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.***
