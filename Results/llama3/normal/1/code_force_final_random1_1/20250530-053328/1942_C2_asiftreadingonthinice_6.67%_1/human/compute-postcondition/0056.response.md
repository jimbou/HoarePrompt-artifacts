Postcondition: ***ans is the sum of x + y - 2, the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a with a difference of 2, and the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1, y is its original value minus the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1, tmp contains half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1, i is equal to the length of a, and a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] is not equal to 2. The current value of y is greater than half of the difference between a[i] and a[i - 1] minus 1. The difference between a[0] and a[len(a) - 1] plus n is even***
