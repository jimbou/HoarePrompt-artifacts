Postcondition: **`ans`, `y`, `tmp` are updated, `i` is 2, `a` has at least 3 elements. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1, `y` is updated, `tmp` is updated. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `ans` is increased by half of the difference, `y` is decreased by half of the difference plus 1, and `tmp` is extended with half of the difference. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
