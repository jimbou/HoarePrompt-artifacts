Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `ans` is either `x` + `y` + 1 or `x` + `y` or `x` + `y` - 1 or `x` + `y` - 2, `tmp` is either an empty list or a list containing half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` or a list containing half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` and half of the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a` or a list containing half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`, half of the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a`, and half of the difference between the fourth element of `a` and the third element of `a`. If the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is 2, then `ans` is either `x` + `y` + 1 or `x` + `y`. Otherwise, if the difference between the fourth element of `a` and the third element of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `y` is updated to its original value minus half of the difference between the fourth element of `a` and the third element of `a` plus 1, `ans` is updated to either `x` + `y` or `x` + `y` - 1 plus half of the difference between the fourth element of `a` and the third element of `a`, and `tmp` is updated to a list containing half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`, half of the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a`, and half of the difference between the fourth element of `a` and the third element of `a`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`, `tmp`, `i`, `ii`, `tt`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.***
