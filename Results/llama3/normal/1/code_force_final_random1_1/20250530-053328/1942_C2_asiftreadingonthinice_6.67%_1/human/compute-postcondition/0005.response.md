Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is an integer equal to `x` + `y` - 1, `tmp` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `tt` - 2 test cases, `i` is 1. The current value of `a[i]` minus `a[i - 1]` equals 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to `x` + `y` - 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `tt` - 2 test cases, and the list `a` is still sorted with at least 2 elements. The difference between the current value of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is still 2.
