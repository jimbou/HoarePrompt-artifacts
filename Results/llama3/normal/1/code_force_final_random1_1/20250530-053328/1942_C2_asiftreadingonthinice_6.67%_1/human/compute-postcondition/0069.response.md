Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x` + `y` - 2, `tmp` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `ii` is not defined, `tt` is not defined, `stdin` is empty. The difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is not equal to 2. The current value of `i` is 1. The difference between the current element of `a` at index `i` and the previous element of `a` at index `i-1` is even. The current value of `y` is greater than half of the difference between the current element of `a` at index `i` and the previous element of `a` at index `i-1`, minus 1.***
