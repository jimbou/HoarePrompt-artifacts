Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `x` + `y` - 2, the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with a difference of 2, and the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with an even difference and `y` greater than half of the difference minus 1, plus 1, `y` is its original value minus the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with an even difference and `y` greater than half of the difference minus 1, `tmp` contains half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with an even difference and `y` greater than half of the difference minus 1, and `i` is equal to the length of `a`. The difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a`, minus `n`, is equal to 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `y`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged. The relationship between the first and last elements of `a` and `n` also remains the same.
