Output State: **n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the difference between the last two elements of a plus 1, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is x + y plus the sum of all the even differences between consecutive elements in a divided by 2 plus half of the difference between the last two elements of a, tmp is a list containing half of all the even differences between consecutive elements in a plus half of the difference between the first element of a plus n and the last element of a, i is len(a) - 1, ii is not defined, tt is not defined, stdin is empty.**

The first line appends half of the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` to `tmp`. Since the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even, this value is an integer. The second line adds half of the difference between the last two elements of `a` to `ans`. The third line subtracts half of the difference between the last two elements of `a` minus 1 from `y`. No other variables are affected.
