Output: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ii` is not defined, `tt` is not defined, `stdin` is empty. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is `x` + `y` plus the sum of all the even differences between consecutive elements in `a` divided by 2 plus 1, and `tmp` is a list containing half of all the even differences between consecutive elements in `a`. Otherwise, if the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference between the last two elements of `a` minus 1, then `y` is updated to its original value minus half of the difference between the last two elements of `a` plus 1, `ans` is updated to `x` + `y` plus the sum of all the even differences between consecutive elements in `a` divided by 2 plus half of the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a`, and `tmp` is updated to a list containing half of all the even differences between consecutive elements in `a` plus half of the difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans` plus `y`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is printed**
