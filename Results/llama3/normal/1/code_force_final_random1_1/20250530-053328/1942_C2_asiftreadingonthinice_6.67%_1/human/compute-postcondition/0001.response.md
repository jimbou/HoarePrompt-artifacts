The only variable in the loop head is `ii` and `tt`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tt`. If `tt` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `tt-1` test cases. So for the loop to be executed `tt` must be greater than 0 and `ii` is now 0.
State: **`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `tt-1` test cases, `ii` is 0**
