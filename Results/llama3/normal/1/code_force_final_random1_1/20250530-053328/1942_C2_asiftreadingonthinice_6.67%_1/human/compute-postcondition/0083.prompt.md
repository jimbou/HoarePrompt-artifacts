Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is x + y - 2, tmp is an empty list, i is not defined, ii is not defined, tt is not defined, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is either `x` + `y` - 1 or `x` + `y` - 2, `tmp` is either an empty list or a list containing half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`, `i` is 1, `ii` is not defined, `tt` is not defined, `stdin` is empty. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is 2, then `ans` is `x` + `y` - 1. If the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `ans` is increased by half of this difference, and `tmp` contains half of this difference. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is either `x` + `y` or `x` + `y` - 1 or `x` + `y` - 2, `tmp` is either an empty list or a list containing half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` or a list containing half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` and half of the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a`, `i` is 2, `ii` is not defined, `tt` is not defined, `stdin` is empty. If the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is 2, then `ans` is either `x` + `y` or `x` + `y` - 1. Otherwise, if the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `y` is updated to its original value minus half of the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a` plus 1, `ans` is updated to either `x` + `y` - 1 or `x` + `y` - 2 plus half of the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a`, and `tmp` is updated to a list containing half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` and half of the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`, `tmp`, `i`, `ii`, `tt`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `ans` is either `x` + `y` + 1 or `x` + `y` or `x` + `y` - 1 or `x` + `y` - 2, `tmp` is either an empty list or a list containing half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` or a list containing half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` and half of the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a` or a list containing half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`, half of the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a`, and half of the difference between the fourth element of `a` and the third element of `a`. If the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is 2, then `ans` is either `x` + `y` + 1 or `x` + `y`. Otherwise, if the difference between the fourth element of `a` and the third element of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `y` is updated to its original value minus half of the difference between the fourth element of `a` and the third element of `a` plus 1, `ans` is updated to either `x` + `y` or `x` + `y` - 1 plus half of the difference between the fourth element of `a` and the third element of `a`, and `tmp` is updated to a list containing half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`, half of the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a`, and half of the difference between the fourth element of `a` and the third element of `a`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`, `tmp`, `i`, `ii`, `tt`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
