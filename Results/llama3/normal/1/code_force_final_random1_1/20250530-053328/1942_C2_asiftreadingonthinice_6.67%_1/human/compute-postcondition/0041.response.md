Postcondition: **The program updates the values of `ans`, `y`, and `tmp` based on the difference between the current element of `a` and the previous element of `a`. If the difference is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference minus 1, `y` is updated to its original value minus half of the difference between the current element of `a` and the previous element of `a` plus 1 minus half of the difference between the current element of `a` and the previous element of `a` minus 1, and `tmp` is updated to contain half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in `a` with an even difference and `y` greater than half of the difference minus 1 plus half of the difference between the current element of `a` and the previous element of `a`. The minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed.**
