Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the minimum value between the calculated answer and n-2. The input consists of an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function sorts the integers, calculates the answer based on the differences between adjacent elements, and prints the minimum value between the answer and n-2.**
