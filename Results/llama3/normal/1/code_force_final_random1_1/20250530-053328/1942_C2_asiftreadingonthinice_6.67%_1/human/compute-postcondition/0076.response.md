Postcondition: ***n, x, y are integers, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, ans is either x + y - 1 or x + y - 2, tmp is either an empty list or a list containing half of the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a, i is 2, ii is not defined, tt is not defined, stdin is empty. If the difference between the third element of a and the second element of a is even and y is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then y is updated to its original value minus half of the difference between the third element of a and the second element of a plus 1, ans is updated to either x + y - 1 or x + y - 2 plus half of the difference between the third element of a and the second element of a, and tmp is updated to a list containing half of the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a and half of the difference between the third element of a and the second element of a. Otherwise, the values of n, x, y, a, ans, tmp, i, ii, tt, and stdin remain unchanged.***
