Output State: **tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains tt - 2 test cases, i is equal to the length of a, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a with a difference of 2 plus the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1 plus 1, tmp is a list containing half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1. The first element of a plus n minus the last element of a equals 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
