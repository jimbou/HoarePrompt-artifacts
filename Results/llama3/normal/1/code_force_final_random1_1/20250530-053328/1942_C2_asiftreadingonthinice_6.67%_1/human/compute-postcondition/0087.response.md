Postcondition: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is `x` + `y` plus the sum of all the even differences between consecutive elements in `a` divided by 2, `tmp` is a list containing half of all the even differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ii` is not defined, `tt` is not defined, `stdin` is empty. The difference between the first element of `a` plus `n` and the last element of `a` is even. The current value of `y` is greater than half of the difference between the last two elements of `a` minus 1.**
