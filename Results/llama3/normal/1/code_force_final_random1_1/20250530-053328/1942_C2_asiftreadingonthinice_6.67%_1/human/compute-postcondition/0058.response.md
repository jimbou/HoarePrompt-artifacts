Postcondition: ***ans is the sum of x + y - 2, the number of pairs of adjacent elements in a with a difference of 2, and the sum of half of the differences of pairs of adjacent elements in a with an even difference and y greater than half of the difference minus 1. If (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, then ans is increased by half of the difference between a[0] and a[len(a) - 1] plus n, plus half of the difference between a[i] and a[i - 1], y is decreased by half of the difference between a[i] and a[i - 1] plus 1, and tmp is increased by half of the difference between a[0] and a[len(a) - 1] plus n. The current value of y is greater than half of the difference between a[i] and a[i - 1] minus 1. The difference between a[0] and a[len(a) - 1] plus n is even. Otherwise, the values of ans, y, and tmp remain unchanged. i is equal to the length of a, and a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] is not equal to 2.***
