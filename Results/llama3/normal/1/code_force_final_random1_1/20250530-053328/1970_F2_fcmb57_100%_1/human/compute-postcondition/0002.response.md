Functionality: **This function takes two lists, 'a' and 'b', as input. It then combines the first element of 'a' (an integer) with the first element of 'b' (a string) and the second element of 'a' (an integer) with the second element of 'b' (a string) and returns these two combined values as a tuple. The function does not modify the original lists 'a' and 'b'.**
