Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It accurately simulates the game of Quidditch as described in the problem statement. The program correctly handles the movement of players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger, as well as the scoring of goals and the elimination of players. The program also correctly prints the main events of the game, including the scoring of goals and the elimination of players, in the correct order.

However, there is a small mistake in the function `func_1`. The function is supposed to return a tuple containing the new coordinates of a player or the Quaffle after a move. But in the given code, it returns a tuple containing the sum of the x-coordinate and the string 'dx', and the sum of the y-coordinate and the string 'dy'. This is incorrect because 'dx' and 'dy' are strings, not integers, and cannot be added to 'x' and 'y'.

To fix this mistake, the function `func_1` should be modified to return a tuple containing the sum of the x-coordinate and the integer value of 'dx', and the sum of the y-coordinate and the integer value of 'dy'. This can be done by replacing the return statement in the function with the following code:

return x + int(dx), y + int(dy)

With this modification, the program will correctly simulate the game of Quidditch and print the main events of the game in the correct order.

Correctness: **False**
