Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first finds the index of the first '1' (chip) from the left using `arr.find('1')`.
2. It then finds the index of the first '1' (chip) from the right using `arr[::-1].find('1')`. This is done by reversing the string and finding the index of the first '1'.
3. It then extracts the substring from the index of the first '1' to the index of the last '1' using `arr[x:n - y]`.
4. Finally, it counts the number of '0's (free cells) in this substring using `z.count('0')` and prints the result.

This logic is correct because it effectively finds the block of chips and counts the number of free cells within that block. The minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block is equal to the number of free cells within the block.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where there are no free cells between the chips, cases where there are free cells between the chips, and cases where there are multiple blocks of chips. Therefore, the program is correct.
