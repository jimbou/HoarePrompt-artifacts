Output State: **t is at least 2, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, arr is a string of n characters, x is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in the reverse of arr, z is a substring of arr starting at index x and ending at index n-y-1, and the number of '0's in the substring z of arr which is equal to z.count('0') has been printed**

The code snippet reads an integer `n` from stdin, which is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a string `arr` of `n` characters. It then finds the index of the first '1' in `arr` and assigns it to `x`, and the index of the first '1' in the reverse of `arr` and assigns it to `y`. Finally, it creates a substring `z` of `arr` starting at index `x` and ending at index `n-y-1`. The number of '0's in the substring `z` of `arr` which is equal to `z.count('0')` has been printed. The value of `t` remains at least 2, and the value of `_` remains 2. Stdin now contains `t-4` test cases.
