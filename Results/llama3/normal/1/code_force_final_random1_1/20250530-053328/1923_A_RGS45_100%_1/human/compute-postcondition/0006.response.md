Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, arr is a string of n characters, x is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in the reverse of arr, z is a substring of arr starting at index x and ending at index n-y-1**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains at least 1, and the value of `_` remains 1. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2, leaving `t-3` test cases. The value of `n` is updated to an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), and the value of `arr` is updated to a string of `n` characters. The value of `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of the character '1' in the string `arr`. The value of `y` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of the character '1' in the reverse of the string `arr`. The value of `z` is updated to a substring of `arr` starting at index `x` and ending at index `n-y-1`.
