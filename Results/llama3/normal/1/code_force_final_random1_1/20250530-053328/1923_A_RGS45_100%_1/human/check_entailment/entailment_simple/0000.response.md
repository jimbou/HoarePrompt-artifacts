Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string of cells `arr`.
3. It finds the index of the first '1' in `arr` using `arr.find('1')` and assigns it to `x`. This gives the starting index of the first block of chips.
4. It finds the index of the first '1' in the reverse of `arr` using `arr[::-1].find('1')` and assigns it to `y`. This gives the ending index of the last block of chips.
5. It extracts the substring `z` from `arr` starting at index `x` and ending at index `n-y-1`. This substring contains all the chips.
6. It counts the number of '0's in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')` and prints the result.

The program is correct because it correctly identifies the starting and ending indices of the blocks of chips and counts the number of free cells between them. The minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block is equal to the number of free cells between the blocks.

Correctness: **True**
