The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer larger than 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n space-separated integers. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. The second line integers are either 0 or 1, and at least one of them is 1.**
