Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n binary digits (0s and 1s). It then finds the first and last occurrences of the digit '1' in the string, extracts the substring between these two occurrences, and prints the number of '0's in this substring. The function processes all test cases and prints the results for each case.**
