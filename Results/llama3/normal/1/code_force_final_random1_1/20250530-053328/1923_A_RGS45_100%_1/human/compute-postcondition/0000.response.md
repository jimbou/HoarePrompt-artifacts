The code `t = int(input(''))` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n space-separated integers. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. The second line integers are either 0 or 1, and at least one of them is 1. The first line of the first test case is accepted as input and converted to an integer, which is assigned to `t`. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n space-separated integers. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. The second line integers are either 0 or 1, and at least one of them is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n space-separated integers. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. The second line integers are either 0 or 1, and at least one of them is 1.**
