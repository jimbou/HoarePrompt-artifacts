The code prints the number of '0's in the substring z of arr which starts at index x (the index of the first '1' in arr) and ends at index n-y-1 (where n is the length of arr and y is the index of the first '1' in the reverse of arr).
Output: **the number of '0's in the substring z of arr (where z is a substring of arr starting at index x and ending at index n-y-1)**
