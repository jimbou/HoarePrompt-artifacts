Output State: **t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, arr is a string of n characters, x is an integer between 0 and n-1, y is an integer between 0 and n-1, z is a substring of arr starting at index x and ending at index n-y-1.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still being at least 1. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, still being 0. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, now containing `t-2` test cases. The value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, inclusive. The variable `arr` is a string of `n` characters, consisting of '0's and '1's, with at least one '1'. The variable `x` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, representing the index of the first '1' in `arr`. The variable `y` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, representing the index of the first '1' in the reversed string `arr`. The variable `z` is a substring of `arr`, starting at index `x` and ending at index `n-y-1`.
