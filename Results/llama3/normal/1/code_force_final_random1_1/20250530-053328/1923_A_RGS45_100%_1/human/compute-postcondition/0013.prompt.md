Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n space-separated integers. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. The second line integers are either 0 or 1, and at least one of them is 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input(''))
    arr = ''.join(input('').split())
    x = arr.find('1')
    y = arr[::-1].find('1')
    z = arr[x:n - y]
    print(z.count('0'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, arr is a string of n characters, x is an integer between 0 and n-1, y is an integer between 0 and n-1, z is a substring of arr starting at index x and ending at index n-y-1, and the number of '0' characters in the substring z is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 1, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, arr is a string of n characters, x is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in the reverse of arr, z is a substring of arr starting at index x and ending at index n-y-1, and the number of '0's in the substring z of arr which is equal to z.count('0') is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 2, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, arr is a string of n characters, x is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in the reverse of arr, z is a substring of arr starting at index x and ending at index n-y-1, and the number of '0's in the substring z of arr which is equal to z.count('0') has been printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
