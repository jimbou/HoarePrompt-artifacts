Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string of binary digits `arr`.
3. It finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` using `arr.find('1')` and stores it in `x`. This gives the starting index of the block of chips.
4. It finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reverse of `arr` using `arr[::-1].find('1')` and stores it in `y`. This gives the ending index of the block of chips.
5. It extracts the substring `z` from `arr` starting at index `x` and ending at index `n-y-1`. This substring contains the block of chips.
6. It counts the number of '0's in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')` and prints the result.

The program's logic is correct because:

* It correctly identifies the starting and ending indices of the block of chips.
* It extracts the correct substring containing the block of chips.
* It correctly counts the number of '0's in the substring, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

Therefore, the program produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
