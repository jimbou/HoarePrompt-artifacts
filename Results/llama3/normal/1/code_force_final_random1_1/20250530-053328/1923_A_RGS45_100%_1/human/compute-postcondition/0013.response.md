Output State: **t is 0, _ is t, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, arr is a string of n characters, x is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in arr, y is an integer equal to the index of the first '1' in the reverse of arr, z is a substring of arr starting at index x and ending at index n-y-1, and the number of '0's in the substring z of arr which is equal to z.count('0') has been printed.**

This output state means that the loop has executed for all the iterations specified by the initial value of `t`. After the loop finishes, `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `_` is equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The stdin contains 0 test cases, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The values of `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are as described in the previous output states, indicating that the loop has processed all test cases and printed the number of '0's in the substring `z` for each test case.
