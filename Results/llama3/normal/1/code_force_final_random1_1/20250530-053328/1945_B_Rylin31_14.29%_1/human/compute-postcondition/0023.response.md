Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, i is 2, a is an integer between 1 and 10^18, b is an integer between 1 and 10^18, m is an integer between 1 and 10^18, mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m. If m is divisible by both a and b, and both a and b are not equal to 1, then the program prints mn // a + mn // b + 1. Otherwise, the program prints the sum of the integer divisions of mn by a and mn by b.***
