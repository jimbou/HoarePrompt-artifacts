The code prints the sum of the integer divisions of `mn` by `a` and `mn` by `b`. Where `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, and `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18.
Output: **mn // a + mn // b (where mn is the minimum of a and b plus m, a is an integer between 1 and 10^18, b is an integer between 1 and 10^18, and m is an integer between 1 and 10^18)**
