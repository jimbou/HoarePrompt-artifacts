Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when `a` or `b` is 1. In this case, the program will print `mn // a + mn // b`, but it should print `mn // a + mn // b + 1` because the firework launched at time 0 is also visible.

For example, when `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `m = 1`, the program will print `2`, but the correct answer is `3` because the firework launched at time 0 is also visible.

The correct code should be:
```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        mn = min(a, b) + m
        print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
```
This code works correctly for all cases, including when `a` or `b` is 1.
