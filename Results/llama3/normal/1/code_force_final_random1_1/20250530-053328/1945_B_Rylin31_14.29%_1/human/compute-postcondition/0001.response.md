The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**
