The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), a is an integer between 1 and 10^18, b is an integer between 1 and 10^18, m is an integer between 1 and 10^18, mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m. If m is divisible by both a and b, and both a and b are greater than 1, then the sum of the integer division of mn by a, the integer division of mn by b, and 1 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the integer division of mn by a and the integer division of mn by b is printed.**
