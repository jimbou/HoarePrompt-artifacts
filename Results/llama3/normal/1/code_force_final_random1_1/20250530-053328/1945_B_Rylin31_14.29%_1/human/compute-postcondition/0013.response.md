Output: **t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, a is an integer between 1 and 10^18, b is an integer between 1 and 10^18, m is an integer between 1 and 10^18, mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m, and this is printed: mn // a + mn // b + 1 (where mn is the minimum of a and b plus m, a is an integer between 1 and 10^18, b is an integer between 1 and 10^18)**
