The code prints the sum of the integer divisions of `mn` by `a` and `mn` by `b`. Where `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, and `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18.
Output: **t is an integer greater than 1, i is 2, a is an integer between 1 and 10^18, b is an integer between 1 and 10^18, m is an integer between 1 and 10^18, mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m, and the sum of the integer divisions of mn by a and mn by b is being printed**
