The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18).

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**
