Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, i is 2, a is an integer between 1 and 10^18, b is an integer between 1 and 10^18, m is an integer between 1 and 10^18, mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m.**

The code reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `m`. The value of `mn` is then calculated as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The number of lines in stdin decreases by 1.
