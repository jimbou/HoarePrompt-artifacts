Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), a is an integer between 1 and 10^18, b is an integer between 1 and 10^18, m is an integer between 1 and 10^18, mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m.**

Explanation: The first line reads three integers from the first line of stdin and assigns them to a, b, and m, respectively. Since t is greater than 0, stdin is not empty, and each line contains three integers between 1 and 10^18. After this line, stdin contains t-1 lines. The second line calculates the minimum of a and b, adds m to it, and assigns the result to mn. The value of mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m. The values of t and i remain unchanged.
