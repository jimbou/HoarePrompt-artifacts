Output: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), a is an integer between 1 and 10^18, b is an integer between 1 and 10^18, m is an integer between 1 and 10^18, mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m. Additionally, either m is not divisible by a, or m is not divisible by b, or a is 1, or b is 1, and the sum of the integer division of mn by a and the integer division of mn by b is being printed**
