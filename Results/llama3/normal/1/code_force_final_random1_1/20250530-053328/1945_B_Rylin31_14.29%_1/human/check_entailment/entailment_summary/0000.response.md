Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

Here's why:

* The program first calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`, which represents the maximum time a firework can be visible in the sky.
* It then calculates the sum of the integer divisions of this result by `a` and `b`, which represents the maximum number of fireworks that can be launched by each installation within the maximum visible time.
* If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and both `a` and `b` are not equal to 1, it adds 1 to the result. This is because in this case, both installations will launch a firework at the same time, and both fireworks will be visible for one minute.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

Correctness: **True**
