Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. 

The key insight is that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the sum of the integer divisions of the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m` by `a` and `b`. This is because the fireworks from the same installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time if the time between launches is greater than the time the firework is visible in the sky.

The program also correctly handles the edge case where `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, and both `a` and `b` are not equal to 1. In this case, it adds 1 to the result because the fireworks from both installations will be visible in the sky at the same time.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required calculation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
