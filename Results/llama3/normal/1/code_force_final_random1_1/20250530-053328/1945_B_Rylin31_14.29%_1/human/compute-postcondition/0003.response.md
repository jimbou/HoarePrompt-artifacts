Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), a is an integer between 1 and 10^18, b is an integer between 1 and 10^18, m is an integer between 1 and 10^18, mn is an integer equal to the minimum of a and b plus m. The current values of a, b, and m are such that m is divisible by both a and b, and both a and b are greater than 1.**
