The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). The integer `t` is assigned to `t`, and the remaining input is still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**
