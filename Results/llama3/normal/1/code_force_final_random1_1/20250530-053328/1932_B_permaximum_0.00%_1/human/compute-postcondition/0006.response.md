Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`, `year` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus the first element of the list `a` modulo the second element of the list `a` or the second element of the list `a`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `year` has been updated to be the sum of its original value (which is the first element of the list `a`) and the result of the expression `year % ai or ai`. The other variables remain unchanged. The expression `year % ai or ai` evaluates to the remainder of `year` divided by `ai` if `ai` is not zero, otherwise it evaluates to `ai`. This updated value of `year` is then added to its original value, resulting in a new value for `year`.
