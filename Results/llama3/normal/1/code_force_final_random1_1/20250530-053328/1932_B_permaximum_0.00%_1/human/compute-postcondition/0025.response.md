To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `ai` and the list `a`. The loop will execute if the list `a` has at least one element. Since `ai` is an element of `a`, we can adjust its state to be the first element of `a`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `year`, and `_` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element of `a`, `year` is 0, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases**
