To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `ai` and the list `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ai` is the second element of `a`, and `a` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `ai` should be the third element of `a`.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `year`, and `_` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element of `a`, `year` is either 0 + (0 or `ai`) if `ai` is odd, or `ai` + (`ai` or 0) if `ai` is even, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-6 test cases.**
