Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The program iterates over each sign's periodicity, adding the time it takes for the sign to occur to the total year. The `year % ai or ai` expression is used to calculate the time it takes for the sign to occur, which is the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is greater than the current year.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the case where the current year is already a multiple of the sign's periodicity, in which case the sign will occur in the next year.

Correctness: **True**
