Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`, `year` is either 0 or `ai` (if `ai` is odd), or `ai` (if `ai` is even), `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `year` is updated to `year + (year % ai or ai)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `year` is updated by adding the result of the expression `year % ai or ai` to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. The expression `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai` if `year` is a multiple of `ai`, and to the remainder of `year` divided by `ai` otherwise. This means that `year` is either incremented by `ai` or by its own remainder when divided by `ai`.
