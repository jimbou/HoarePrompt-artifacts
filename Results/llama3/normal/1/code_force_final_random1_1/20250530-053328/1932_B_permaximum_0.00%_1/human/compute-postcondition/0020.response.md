Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `ai` is not defined, `year` is the sum of all elements in the initial list `a`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` will be exhausted and become empty, `ai` will no longer be defined, and `year` will be the sum of all elements in the initial list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
