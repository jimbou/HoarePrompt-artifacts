To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `ai` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `a` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, and `ai` is the first element of `a`. For the loop to execute again, `ai` should be the next element in the list `a`, and `a` should have at least one more element.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element of `a`, `year` is either 0 or `ai` if `ai` is odd, or `ai` if `ai` is even, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**
