Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `ai` is not defined, `year` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a` plus the sum of all elements in the list `a` modulo each element in the list `a` or each element in the list `a`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, and the value of `year` is being printed which is equal to 0 because the sum of an empty list is 0 and the modulo operation of 0 with any number is 0**
