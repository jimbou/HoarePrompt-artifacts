Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer, a is a list of integers, ai is not defined, year is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

The code block reads an integer `n` from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, splits them into individual integers using the `split()` function, converts them to integers using the `map()` function, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The variable `year` is assigned the value 0. 

The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `ai` remains undefined as it is not defined or modified by the code. The value of `year` is set to 0, which is the sum of an empty list (initial value of `a`) plus the sum of all elements in the list `a` modulo each element in the list `a` (which is also 0). 

The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2, as two inputs are read from stdin.
