Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list of integers, `ai` is not defined, `year` is the least common multiple of all elements in the original list `a`, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty, and the variable `ai` will not be defined. The value of `year` will be the least common multiple of all the elements in the original list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the number of test cases in stdin decreases by 5.
