Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a`.
3. It initializes the `year` variable to 0.
4. It iterates over each sign's periodicity `ai` in `a`. For each `ai`, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur by adding the remainder of `year` divided by `ai` (or `ai` if the remainder is 0) to `year`. This effectively "waits" for the sign to occur in the next year that is a multiple of `ai`.
5. After iterating over all signs, it prints the final `year` value, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately models the problem's requirements:

* It waits for each sign to occur in the next year that is a multiple of its periodicity.
* It ensures that each sign occurs after the previous sign has occurred.

The execution summary is also accurate, as the program does indeed calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in each test case and prints the LCM.

Correctness: **True**
