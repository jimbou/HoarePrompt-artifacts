Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the list of signs and for each sign, it calculates the year in which the sign will occur by adding the remainder of the current year divided by the periodicity of the sign (or the periodicity itself if the remainder is 0) to the current year. This ensures that the signs occur sequentially and the apocalypse happens in the year calculated by the program.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the cases where the periodicity of a sign is 1 (in which case the sign will occur in the next year) and the cases where the periodicity of a sign is greater than 1 (in which case the sign will occur in the year that is a multiple of the periodicity).

The program also handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the number of signs is 1 (in which case the apocalypse will happen in the year that is equal to the periodicity of the sign) and when the number of signs is greater than 1 (in which case the apocalypse will happen in the year that is calculated by iterating over the list of signs).

Overall, the program is correct and it will produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
