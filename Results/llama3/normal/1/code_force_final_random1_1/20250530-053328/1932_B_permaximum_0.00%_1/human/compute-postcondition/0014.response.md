To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ai` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `ai` is not defined before the loop, we can define it as the first element of the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element of the list `a`, `year` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases**
