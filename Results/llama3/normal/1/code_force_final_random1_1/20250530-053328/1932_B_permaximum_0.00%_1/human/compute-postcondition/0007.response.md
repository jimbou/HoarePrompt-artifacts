To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ai` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`, and `a` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `ai` should be the next element in the list `a`, and `a` should have at least 3 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`, `year` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus the first element of the list `a` modulo the second element of the list `a` or the second element of the list `a`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases**
