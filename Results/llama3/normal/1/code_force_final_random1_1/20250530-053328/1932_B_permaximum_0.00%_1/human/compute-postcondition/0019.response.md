Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `year` is either `2*ai` (if `ai` is odd), or `ai + ai/2` (if `ai` is even).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still between 2 and 1000, `n` is still an integer, `a` is still a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `ai` is still the third element of the list `a`, and `_` is still 2. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still `t-4`. The value of `year` has been updated to either twice the value of `ai` if `ai` is odd, or the sum of `ai` and half of `ai` if `ai` is even.
