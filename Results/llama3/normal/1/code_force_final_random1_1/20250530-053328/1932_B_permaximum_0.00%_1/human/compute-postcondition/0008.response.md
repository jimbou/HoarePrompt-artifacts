Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element of the list `a`, `year` is equal to the first element of the list `a` plus the first element of the list `a` modulo the second element of the list `a` or the second element of the list `a` plus the first element of the list `a` plus the first element of the list `a` modulo the second element of the list `a` or the second element of the list `a` modulo the third element of the list `a` or the third element of the list `a`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `year` is updated by adding the result of the modulo operation between the first element of the list `a` and the third element of the list `a` (or the third element of the list `a` if the result of the modulo operation is zero). The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
