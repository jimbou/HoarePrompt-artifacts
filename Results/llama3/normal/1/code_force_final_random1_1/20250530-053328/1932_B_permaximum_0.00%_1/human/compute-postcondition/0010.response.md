The code prints the value of `year` which is the sum of all elements in the list `a` plus the sum of all elements in the list `a` modulo each element in the list `a` or each element in the list `a`. Since `a` is an empty list, the sum of all elements in the list `a` is 0. The sum of all elements in the list `a` modulo each element in the list `a` or each element in the list `a` is also 0 because there are no elements in the list `a` to perform the modulo operation. Therefore, the value of `year` is 0.
Output: **0**
