Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    year = 0
    for ai in a:
        year += year % ai or ai
    print(year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `ai` is not defined, `year` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a` plus the sum of all elements in the list `a` modulo each element in the list `a` or each element in the list `a`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, and the value of `year` is being printed which is equal to 0 because the sum of an empty list is 0 and the modulo operation of 0 with any number is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `ai` is not defined, `year` is the sum of all elements in the initial list `a`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, and the year which is equal to 0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list of integers, `ai` is not defined, `year` is the least common multiple of all elements in the original list `a`, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and the least common multiple of all elements in the original list `a` which is `year` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
