Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer, a is a list of integers, year is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to an integer value read from the input. The list `a` is populated with a list of integers read from the input. The variable `year` is reset to 0. The value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 2, as two inputs are read from `stdin` by the code.
