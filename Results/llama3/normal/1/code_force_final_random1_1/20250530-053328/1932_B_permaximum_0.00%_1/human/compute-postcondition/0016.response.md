To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ai` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element of the list `a`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `ai` must be the second element of the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`, `year` is either 0 or `ai` (if `ai` is odd), or `ai` (if `ai` is even), `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases**
