Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element of `a`, `year` is either 2 * `ai` if `ai` is odd, or 2 * `ai` if `ai` is even, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-6 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `year` has been updated based on the value of `ai`. If `ai` is odd, `year` is now equal to 2 times `ai`. If `ai` is even, `year` is also equal to 2 times `ai`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
