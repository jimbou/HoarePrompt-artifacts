Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `ai` is not defined, `year` is equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a` plus the sum of all elements in the list `a` modulo each element in the list `a` or each element in the list `a`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` is empty, the variable `ai` is no longer defined, and the variable `year` has been updated to be the sum of all elements in the list `a` plus the sum of all elements in the list `a` modulo each element in the list `a` or each element in the list `a`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
