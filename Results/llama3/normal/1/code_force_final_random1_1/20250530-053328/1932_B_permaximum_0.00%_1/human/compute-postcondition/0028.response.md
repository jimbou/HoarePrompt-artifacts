Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element of `a`, `year` is either 0 + (0 or `ai`) if `ai` is odd, or `ai` + (`ai` or 0) if `ai` is even, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-6 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `year` has been updated based on its previous value and the value of `ai`. If `ai` is odd, `year` is now 0 plus either 0 or `ai`, and if `ai` is even, `year` is now `ai` plus either `ai` or 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ai`, and `_` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
