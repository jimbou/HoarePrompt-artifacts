You will be given an **initial state** (precondition) and a **Python code snippet** containing a `print` statement. Your task is to **determine exactly what will be printed** when the statement executes.

If a variable or object has a known **explicit value**, use that value in the output.
If a variable or object is defined by a **formula or condition**, describe its value using the given information.
Always provide the most **precise** description possible based on the precondition.
Format the final output as:  Output: **what is printed**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task:


Example1:
Initial State: `arr` is a list containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 'sum' is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`
```
print(arr[2], sum)
```
Example Answer:
The code prints the element at index 2 of the list `arr` which is 3, and the value of `sum` which is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`.
Output: **3(the 3rd element of the list arr), 15 (which is the sum is the sum of all elements in list)**

Example2:
Initial State: The points list is a list of points. The `shoelace_sum` is the sum of all terms calculated as \(x_1 * y_2 - y_1 * x_2\) for each consecutive pair of points in the `points` list, the `area` is the absolute value of `shoelace_sum` divided by 2.0, `i` is equal to `len(points) - 2`, and `x1` is the first element of `points[i]`, `y1` is the second element of `points[i]`, while `x2` is the first element of `points[i + 1]`, and `y2` is the second element of `points[i + 1]`.
```
print(area)
```
Example Answer:
The `print(area)` statement will print the calculated area of the polygon formed by the points in the `points` list.
Since the exact `points` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `area`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated area.
Output: **area (where area is the area of the polygon formed by the points in the `points` list)**

Example3:
Initial State: `balances` is a list of integers, `A` is the first element of the balances list, `B` is the second element of the balances list, and the amount is an integer  less than or equal to A.
```
print(f"The amount amount is less than or equal to A")
```
Example Answer:
The code prints a formatted string indicating whether the amount is less than or equal to A. Where A is the first element of the balances list and amount is an integer less than or equal to A.
Output: **The amount [amount] is less than or equal to [A] (where amount is the value of amount and A is the first element of the balances list)**
Your Task:
Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in range(len(line)) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is True if `line[ind]` is 'Q' or `line[ind]` is `obj`, and False if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two elements where the element at index team is increased by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, otherwise it is [10, 0] if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is [0, 10], `t` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`, `time` is `t-1`, `obj` is the last string of the last line of stdin, `com` is the second last string of the last line of stdin, `el` is the last string of the last line of stdin, `comand` is the list of strings split from the last line of stdin, and stdin contains at least `t` lines of input. If `len(comand)` is 3, then if `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is True. If `el` is not '.Q', then `points` is a list containing two elements where the element at index team is increased by 10 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is increased by 10 at index 0. If `el` is '.S', then this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is `t-1` and GoalName[team] is the name of the team that caught the golden snitch. If `len(comand)` is not 3, then `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or (`isPlayer(obj)` and `elements['.B']` == `nxt`), then player is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and this is printed: "[time] [player] ELIMINATED". Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', then `allPlayers[obj]` is False and if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, then team is the value of `goalIn(pos)` and the following is printed: "[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL". If `com` is not 'T', then `elements[obj]` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])` if `obj` is a player, otherwise `elements[obj]` remains unchanged.
```
print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))

```
Now, please think step by step. Based on the precondition which describes the state of the program, variables , objects etc before the code is executed, calculate what will be printed when the print statement is executed. Explain the values of the variables, objects etc. that are printed.
Use natural language to describe the output, easily understandable by a human and strictly adhere to the format Output: **what is printed**.
