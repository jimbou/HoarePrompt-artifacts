    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the scores of the two teams)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function simulates a game where players move around a grid and interact with each other and the environment. The game state is read from standard input, which contains the grid dimensions, the grid itself, and a series of commands. The function processes these commands, updating the game state accordingly, and prints out events such as player eliminations, goals, and the final score. The game continues until all commands have been processed, at which point the final score is printed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pos is a pair of integers representing a position on the field, and goal is a list of two lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents a goal position on the field, with the first list representing the goals of the red team and the second list representing the goals of the blue team.
    res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
    return res
    #The program returns res which is 0 if pos is in the goals of the red team, 1 if pos is in the goals of the blue team, and -1 otherwise.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the team affiliation of a given position on the field, returning 0 if the position is a goal of the red team, 1 if it's a goal of the blue team, and -1 if it's neither.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: el is a string of length 2, where the first character is either 'B', 'R', or '.' and the second character is either a digit (0-9) or 'G' or 'Q'.
    res = (el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'
    return res
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the first character of the string 'el' is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether a given 2-character string meets specific conditions, returning True if the first character is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', and False otherwise.
