The code prints a string indicating that a goal has been scored, including the current time and the name of the team that scored the goal.

The time is the current value of the `time` variable, which is 0.

The team name is the value of `GoalName[team]`, where `team` is the value returned by the `goalIn(pos)` function. Since `pos` is the current position and it is in a goal, `goalIn(pos)` returns a value other than -1, which corresponds to a team. The exact team name is not provided, but it is the value associated with the `team` index in the `GoalName` list.

Output: **0 [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where GoalName[team] is the name of the team that scored the goal)**
