Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than 2, m is an integer, grid is a list containing at least four lists of m pairs of characters separated by spaces, elements is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of line[ind] and the value is the tuple (i, ind) for each ind in range(len(line)) if line[ind] is not '..', allPlayers is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of line[ind] and the value is False if line[ind] is a player and not '..', goal is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B' and the second character of line[ind] is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple (i, ind) if the second character of line[ind] is 'G', otherwise it is empty, points is a list containing two zeros, stdin contains at least 1 line of input: the next n-4 lines contain a string of m pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer t, i is 2, line must have at least m characters, ind is m-1
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing at least four lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in `range(len(line))` if `line[ind]` is not '..', and the key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(2, 0)`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is `False` if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input: the next `n-4` lines contain a string of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer `t`, `i` is 2, `line` must have at least 1 character, `ind` is 0. If `line[ind]` is a player, then the value of `line[ind]` is set to `False`. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is '..', then no changes are made to `elements`, `allPlayers`, or `goal`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing at least four lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in `range(len(line))` if `line[ind]` is not '..', and the key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(2, 0)`, and the key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is `False` if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', if `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input: the next `n-4` lines contain a string of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer `t`, `i` is 2, `line` must have at least 2 characters, `ind` is 1. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `elements` and `allPlayers` are updated accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing at least four lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in `range(len(line))` if `line[ind]` is not '..', and the key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(2, 0)`, and the key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is `False` if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', if `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input: the next `n-4` lines contain a string of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer `t`, `i` is 2, `line` must have at least 3 characters, `ind` is 2. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `elements` and `allPlayers` are updated accordingly. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' else 1, `goal[tmp]` has an additional tuple `(i, ind)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
