Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, grid is a list containing n lists of m pairs of characters separated by spaces, elements is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of line[ind] and the value is the tuple (i, ind) for each ind in range(len(line)) if line[ind] is not '..', allPlayers is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of line[ind] and the value is False if line[ind] is a player and not '..', goal is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B' and the second character of line[ind] is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple (i, ind) if the second character of line[ind] is 'G', otherwise it is empty, points is a list containing two zeros, t must be greater than 0, i is n-1, line must have at least m characters, ind is m-1, time is 0, comand is a list of strings split from the first line of stdin, stdin contains at least -1 lines of input, obj is the first element of comand, com is the second element of comand, pos is the value of elements[obj], and nxt is the tuple (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]).**

In this output state, the values of `obj`, `com`, `pos`, and `nxt` have been updated based on the code execution. The value of `obj` is now the first element of `comand`, and the value of `com` is the second element of `comand`. The value of `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, which is a tuple containing the position of the object in the grid. The value of `nxt` is the tuple containing the new position of the object after moving in the direction specified by `com`. All other variables remain unchanged.
