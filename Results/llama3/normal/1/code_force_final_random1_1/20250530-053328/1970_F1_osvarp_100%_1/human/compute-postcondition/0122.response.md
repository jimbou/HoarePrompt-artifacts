Postcondition: **The program updates the game state based on the given command and object. If the object is '.B' and the next position is a player, or if the object is a player and the next position is '.B', the program prints "0 [player] ELIMINATED" and updates the game state accordingly. Otherwise, if the command is 'T', the program checks if the current position is in a goal and updates the points list accordingly. If the command is not 'T', the program updates the value of elements[obj] to nxt if obj is a player. In all cases, the program maintains the integrity of the game state, ensuring that the elements dictionary, allPlayers dictionary, goal list, and points list are updated correctly based on the game logic.**
