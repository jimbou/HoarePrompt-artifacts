Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing a single list of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is False, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input: the next `n-1` lines contain a string of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer `t`, `i` is 0, `line` must have at least 1 character, `ind` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `allPlayers` has been updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is the current player (i.e., the value of `line[ind]`) and the value is False. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the same input lines.
