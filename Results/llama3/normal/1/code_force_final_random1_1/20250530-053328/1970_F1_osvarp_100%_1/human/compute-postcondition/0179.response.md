Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in range(len(line)) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is True if `line[ind]` is 'Q' or `line[ind]` is `obj`, and False if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two elements where the element at index team is increased by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, otherwise it is [10, 0] if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is [0, 10], `t` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`, `time` is `t-1`, `obj` is the last string of the last line of stdin, `com` is the second last string of the last line of stdin, `el` is the last string of the last line of stdin, `comand` is the list of strings split from the last line of stdin, and stdin contains at least `t` lines of input. If `len(comand)` is 3, then if `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is True. If `el` is not '.Q', then `points` is a list containing two elements where the element at index team is increased by 10 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is increased by 10 at index 0. If `el` is '.S', then this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is `t-1` and GoalName[team] is the name of the team that caught the golden snitch. If `len(comand)` is not 3, then `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or (`isPlayer(obj)` and `elements['.B']` == `nxt`), then player is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and this is printed: "[time] [player] ELIMINATED". Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', then `allPlayers[obj]` is False and if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, then team is the value of `goalIn(pos)` and the following is printed: "[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL". If `com` is not 'T', then `elements[obj]` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])` if `obj` is a player, otherwise `elements[obj]` remains unchanged.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the game has been fully played out. The `t` variable is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The `time` variable is `t-1`, which is the last time step of the game. The `obj`, `com`, and `el` variables are the last command and object processed by the loop. The `points` list contains the final scores of the game, with the element at index team increased by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, otherwise it is [10, 0] if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is [0, 10]. The `allPlayers` dictionary contains the final state of the players, with the value True if the player is 'Q' or `obj`, and False if the player is not '..'. The `elements` dictionary contains the final positions of the objects, with the value of `elements[obj]` updated to `nxt` if `obj` is a player and `com` is not 'T'. The `goal` list contains the final state of the goals, with the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty. The `grid` list contains the final state of the game board, with each element being a pair of characters separated by spaces. The `m` and `n` variables remain unchanged, indicating the size of the game board. The `i` and `ind` variables remain unchanged, indicating the last row and column of the game board. The `line` variable must have at least `m` characters, indicating the last line of the game board. The `stdin` variable contains at least `t` lines of input, indicating the number of commands processed by the loop.
