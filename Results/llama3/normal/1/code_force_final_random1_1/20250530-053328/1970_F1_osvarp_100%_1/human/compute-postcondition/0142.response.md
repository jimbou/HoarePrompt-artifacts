The code prints a formatted string indicating the time and the goal name based on the team. The time is 1, and the team is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`, which is not explicitly defined in the precondition. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `goalIn(pos)` function likely determines the team based on the position `pos`.

Since the exact value of `pos` and the implementation of `goalIn(pos)` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `team`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the time and the corresponding goal name.

Output: **1 [GoalName[team]] (where GoalName[team] is the goal name corresponding to the team determined by the goalIn(pos) function)**
