Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in range(len(line)) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is False if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `t` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`, and stdin contains at least 0 lines of input.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in range(len(line)) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is True if `line[ind]` is 'Q' and False if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two zeros if `el` is '.Q', otherwise it is [10, 0] if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is [0, 10], `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`, `time` is 0, `obj` is the first string of the first line of stdin, `com` is the second string of the first line of stdin, `el` is the third string of the first line of stdin, and stdin contains at least -1 lines of input. If `el` is equal to '.S', then "0 [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH" is printed. If the length of the command is not equal to 3, the game state has been updated based on the given command and object. If the object is '.B', the elements dictionary has been updated such that the value of elements['.B'] is now nxt, and the allPlayers dictionary, goal list, and points list remain unchanged. If the object is not '.B', the program has checked if the current position is in a goal and updated the points list accordingly if the command is 'T', or updated the value of elements[obj] to nxt if the command is not 'T' and obj is a player. In all cases, the program maintains the integrity of the game state, ensuring that the elements dictionary, allPlayers dictionary, goal list, and points list are updated correctly based on the game logic.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in range(len(line)) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is True if `line[ind]` is 'Q' or `line[ind]` is `obj`, and False if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two elements where the element at index team is increased by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, otherwise it is [10, 0] if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is [0, 10], `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`, `time` is 1, `obj` is the second string of the first line of stdin, `com` is the third string of the first line of stdin, `el` is the first string of the first line of stdin, and stdin contains at least -1 lines of input. `comand` is a list of strings split from the first line of stdin. If `len(comand)` is 3, then if `el` is '.S', the program updates the points list to [10, 0] if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is [0, 20], sets the team to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is 0, and prints '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is 1 and GoalName[team] is the name of the team with index team in the GoalName list. If `el` is not '.S', the program does not perform any actions. If `len(comand)` is not 3, then pos is the value of elements[obj], nxt is the tuple (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt), then player is obj if isPlayer(obj) is True, otherwise it is grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]], and this is printed: "1 [player] ELIMINATED". Otherwise, allPlayers[obj] is False, and if goalIn(pos) is not -1, then this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' where time is 1 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal team. If com is 'T', then elements[obj] is updated to nxt if obj is a player.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in range(len(line)) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is True if `line[ind]` is 'Q' or `line[ind]` is `obj`, and False if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two elements where the element at index team is increased by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, otherwise it is [10, 0] if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is [0, 10], `t` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`, `time` is 2, `obj` is the second string of the first line of stdin, `com` is the third string of the first line of stdin, `el` is the first string of the first line of stdin, `comand` is the list of strings split from the first line of stdin, and stdin contains at least -1 lines of input. If `len(comand)` is 3, then if `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is True. If `el` is not '.Q', then `points` is a list containing two elements where the element at index team is increased by 10 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is increased by 10 at index 0. If `el` is '.S', then this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is 2 and GoalName[team] is the name of the team that caught the golden snitch. If `len(comand)` is not 3, then `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or (`isPlayer(obj)` and `elements['.B']` == `nxt`), then player is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and this is printed: "2 [player] ELIMINATED". Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', then `allPlayers[obj]` is False and if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, then team is the value of `goalIn(pos)` and the following is printed: "2 [GoalName[team]] GOAL". If `com` is not 'T', then `elements[obj]` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])` if `obj` is a player, otherwise `elements[obj]` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
