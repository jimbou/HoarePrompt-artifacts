Output State: **n is greater than 2, m is an integer, grid is a list containing at least four lists of m pairs of characters separated by spaces, elements is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of line[ind] and the value is the tuple (i, ind) for each ind in range(len(line)) if line[ind] is not '..', allPlayers is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of line[ind] and the value is False if line[ind] is a player and not '..', goal is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B' and the second character of line[ind] is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple (i, ind) if the second character of line[ind] is 'G', otherwise it is empty, points is a list containing two zeros, stdin contains at least 1 line of input: the next n-4 lines contain a string of m pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer t, i is 2, line must have at least m characters, ind is m-1**

The code reads a line from stdin and appends it to the grid. The grid now contains at least four lists of m pairs of characters separated by spaces. The elements dictionary is updated with new key-value pairs for each character in the line, except for '..'. The allPlayers dictionary is also updated with new key-value pairs for each player in the line, except for '..'. The goal list is updated with new tuples for each character in the line that meets the conditions. The points list remains unchanged. The stdin now contains at least 1 line of input: the next n-4 lines contain a string of m pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer t. The value of i and ind remains the same.
