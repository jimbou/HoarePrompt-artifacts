stdin contains at least 3 lines of input: the first line contains two integers n and m, the next n lines contain a string of m pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer t. The pairs of characters can be "..", "R0" to "R9", "B0" to "B9", "RG", "BG", or ".Q". The integer t is followed by t lines, each containing a pair of characters and a command, where the command can be "U", "D", "L", "R", "C", or "T".
