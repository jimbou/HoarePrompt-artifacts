Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and m are integers, grid is an empty list, elements is a dictionary with a single key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1), allPlayers is an empty dictionary, goal is a list containing two empty lists, points is a list containing two zeros, stdin contains at least 2 lines of input: the next n lines contain a string of m pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer t.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing a single list of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in `range(len(line))` if `line[ind]` is not '..'. If `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is False. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G' and `line[ind]` is not '..', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)`. Otherwise, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists. `points` is a list containing two zeros, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input: the next `n-1` lines contain a string of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer `t`, `i` is 0, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing at least three lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in range(len(line)) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is False if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input: the next `n-3` lines contain a string of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer `t`, `i` is 1, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing at least four lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in `range(len(line))` if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is `False` if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input: the next `n-4` lines contain a string of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer `t`, `i` is 2, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
