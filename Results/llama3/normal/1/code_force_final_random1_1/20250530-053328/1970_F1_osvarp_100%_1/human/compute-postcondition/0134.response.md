Postcondition: **The program executes based on the value of `el`. If `el` is '.S', the program updates the points list to [10, 0] if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is [0, 20], sets the team to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is 0, and prints '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is 1 and GoalName[team] is the name of the team with index team in the GoalName list. If `el` is not '.S', the program does not perform any actions.**
