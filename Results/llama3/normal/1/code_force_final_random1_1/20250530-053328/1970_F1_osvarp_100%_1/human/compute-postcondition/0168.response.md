The code prints a formatted string containing the value of `time`, the value of `GoalName[team]`, and the string 'GOAL'. 

Here, `time` is 2, `GoalName[team]` is the value of `GoalName` at the index equal to the value of `team`, and `team` is the value of `goalIn(pos)`.

Output: **2 [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where GoalName[team] is the value of GoalName at the index equal to the value of team)**
