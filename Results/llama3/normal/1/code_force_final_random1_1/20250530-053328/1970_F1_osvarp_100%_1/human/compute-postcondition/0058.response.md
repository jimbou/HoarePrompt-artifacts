Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing at least three lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in range(len(line)) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is False if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input: the next `n-3` lines contain a string of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer `t`, `i` is 1, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `elements` dictionary will contain key-value pairs for all non-'..' elements in the `line` list, where the key is the element and the value is its index in the list. The `allPlayers` dictionary will contain key-value pairs for all player elements in the `line` list, where the key is the player and the value is False. The `goal` list will contain two lists, the first list containing the indices of 'B' elements with 'G' as their second character, and the second list containing the indices of all elements with 'G' as their second character. The `points` list will still contain two zeros. The `stdin` will still contain at least one line of input, and the `i` variable will still be 1. The `line` list will still have at least `m` characters, and the `ind` variable will be `m-1`.
