Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple (`i`, `ind`) for each `ind` in range(len(`line`)) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is False if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple (`i`, `ind`) if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple (`i`, `ind`) if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`, `time` is 0, `comand` is a list of strings split from the first line of stdin, stdin contains at least -1 lines of input, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is the tuple (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`), and `player` is the value of `obj` if `obj` is a player, otherwise it is the value of `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and this is printed: "0 [player] ELIMINATED"**
