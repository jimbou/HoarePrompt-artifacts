To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for ind in range(len(line)):`.

The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `ind`. According to the code, `ind` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ind` is 0. To execute the loop again, `ind` must be incremented to 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing at least three lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in range(len(line)) if `line[ind]` is not '..', if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is False, if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G' and `line[ind]` is not '..', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)`, otherwise, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input: the next `n-3` lines contain a string of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer `t`, `i` is 1, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is 1. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..'. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False. If `line[ind]` is not a player and not '..', then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is False. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G' and `line[ind]` is not '..', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)`, otherwise, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.**
