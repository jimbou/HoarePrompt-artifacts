Based on the given initial state, let's break down the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

1. `time`: This variable is explicitly stated to be 2.
2. `GoalName[team]`: The `team` variable is determined based on the value of `obj[0]`. If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1; otherwise, it is 0. Since `obj` is the first string of the first line of stdin, and the first line of stdin is split into a list of strings (`comand`), we can infer that `obj` is the first element of `comand`. However, the exact value of `obj[0]` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `team` or `GoalName[team]`.

Given the information, the print statement will output the value of `time` (which is 2) and the value of `GoalName[team]`, which depends on the value of `obj[0]`.

Output: **2 [GoalName[team]] (where GoalName[team] is the value of GoalName at index team, which is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of obj[0])**
