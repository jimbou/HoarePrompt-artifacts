Output State: **n is greater than 1, m is an integer, grid is a list containing at least three lists of m pairs of characters separated by spaces, elements is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of line[ind] and the value is the tuple (i, ind) for each ind in range(len(line)) if line[ind] is not '..', if line[ind] is a player and not '..', then allPlayers is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of line[ind] and the value is False, if the second character of line[ind] is 'G' and line[ind] is not '..', then goal is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple (i, ind), otherwise, goal is a list containing two empty lists, points is a list containing two zeros, stdin contains at least 1 line of input: the next n-3 lines contain a string of m pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer t, i is 1, line must have at least m characters, ind is m-1**

The code reads a line from stdin, splits it into a list of pairs of characters separated by spaces, and appends this list to the grid. This operation does not affect the values of n, m, elements, allPlayers, goal, points, i, or ind. The only change is that the grid now contains an additional list of pairs of characters, and stdin has one less line of input.
