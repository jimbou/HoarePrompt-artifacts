The code prints a formatted string indicating the time and the player that has been eliminated. The time is given by the variable `time`, which is 2. The player is given by the variable `player`, which is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is True, or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` otherwise.

Since the exact value of `obj` and the result of `isPlayer(obj)` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `player`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the time and the player that has been eliminated.

Output: **2 [player] ELIMINATED (where player is either obj if isPlayer(obj) is True, or grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] otherwise)**
