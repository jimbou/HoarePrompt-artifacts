Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing a single list of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input: the next `n-1` lines contain a string of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer `t`, `i` is 0, `line` must have at least 1 character, `ind` is 0, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..' and is not a player. If the second character of the current value of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list is empty and the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)`. Otherwise, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists.***
