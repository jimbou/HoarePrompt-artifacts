You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in range(len(line)) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is True if `line[ind]` is 'Q' or `line[ind]` is `obj`, and False if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two elements where the element at index team is increased by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, otherwise it is [10, 0] if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is [0, 10], `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`, `time` is 1, `obj` is the second string of the first line of stdin, `com` is the third string of the first line of stdin, `el` is the first string of the first line of stdin, and stdin contains at least -1 lines of input. `comand` is a list of strings split from the first line of stdin. If `len(comand)` is 3, then if `el` is '.S', the program updates the points list to [10, 0] if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is [0, 20], sets the team to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is 0, and prints '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is 1 and GoalName[team] is the name of the team with index team in the GoalName list. If `el` is not '.S', the program does not perform any actions. If `len(comand)` is not 3, then pos is the value of elements[obj], nxt is the tuple (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt), then player is obj if isPlayer(obj) is True, otherwise it is grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]], and this is printed: "1 [player] ELIMINATED". Otherwise, allPlayers[obj] is False, and if goalIn(pos) is not -1, then this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' where time is 1 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal team. If com is 'T', then elements[obj] is updated to nxt if obj is a player.
```
for time in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
