Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in range(len(line)) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is True if `line[ind]` is 'Q' or `line[ind]` is `obj`, and False if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', and `allPlayers[obj]` is False, `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two elements where the element at index `team` is increased by 1 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, otherwise it is [10, 0] if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise it is [0, 10], `t` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is `m-1`, `time` is 2, `obj` is the second string of the first line of stdin, `com` is the third string of the first line of stdin, `el` is the first string of the first line of stdin, `comand` is the list of strings split from the first line of stdin, stdin contains at least -1 lines of input, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, then `team` is the value of `goalIn(pos)` and the following is printed: "2 [GoalName[team]] GOAL".***
