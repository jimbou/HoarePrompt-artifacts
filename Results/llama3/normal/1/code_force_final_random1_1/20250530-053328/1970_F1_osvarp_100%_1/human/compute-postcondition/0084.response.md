Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing at least four lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in `range(len(line))` if `line[ind]` is not '..', and the key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(2, 0)`, and the key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is `False` if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', if `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input: the next `n-4` lines contain a string of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer `t`, `i` is 2, `line` must have at least 3 characters, `ind` is 2. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `elements` and `allPlayers` are updated accordingly. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' else 1, `goal[tmp]` has an additional tuple `(i, ind)`.***
