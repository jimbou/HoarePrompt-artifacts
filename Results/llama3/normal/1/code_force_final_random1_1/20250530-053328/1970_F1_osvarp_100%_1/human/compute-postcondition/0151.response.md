Postcondition: ***n is greater than or equal to 0, m is an integer, grid is a list containing n lists of m pairs of characters separated by spaces, elements is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of line[ind] and the value is the tuple (i, ind) for each ind in range(len(line)) if line[ind] is not '..', allPlayers is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of line[ind] and the value is True if line[ind] is 'Q' and False if line[ind] is a player and not '..', goal is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple (i, ind) if line[ind][0] is 'B' and the second character of line[ind] is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple (i, ind) if the second character of line[ind] is 'G', otherwise it is empty, points is a list containing two elements where the element at index team is increased by 1 if goalIn(pos) is not -1, otherwise it is [10, 0] if obj[0] is 'B', otherwise it is [0, 10], t must be greater than 1, i is n-1, line must have at least m characters, ind is m-1, time is 1, obj is the first string of the first line of stdin, com is the second string of the first line of stdin, el is the third string of the first line of stdin, and stdin contains at least -1 lines of input, comand is a list of strings split from the first line of stdin, pos is the value of elements[obj], nxt is the tuple (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt), then player is obj if isPlayer(obj) is True, otherwise it is grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]], and this is printed: "1 [player] ELIMINATED". Otherwise, allPlayers[obj] is False, and if goalIn(pos) is not -1, then this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' where time is 1 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal team. If com is 'T', then elements[obj] is updated to nxt if obj is a player.***
