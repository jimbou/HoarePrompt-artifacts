Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing at least three lists of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in range(len(line)) if `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is False if `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', otherwise it is empty, `points` is a list containing two zeros, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input: the next `n-3` lines contain a string of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer `t`, `i` is 1, `line` must have at least `m` characters, `ind` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `elements[line[ind]]` has been updated to `(i, ind)`, where `i` is 1 and `ind` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `elements` now contains an additional key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)`. The rest of the variables and their values remain the same as in the initial state.
