Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `grid` is a list containing a single list of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, `elements` is a dictionary with a key-value pair '.B': (-1, -1) and another key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is the tuple `(i, ind)` if `line[ind]` is not '..'. If `line[ind]` is a player and not '..', then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the value of `line[ind]` and the value is False. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G' and `line[ind]` is not '..', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, the first list is empty and the second list contains the tuple `(i, ind)`. Otherwise, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists. `points` is a list containing two zeros, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input: the next `n-1` lines contain a string of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the next line contains an integer `t`, `i` is 0, `line` must have at least 2 characters, `ind` is 1, and `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False. If `line[ind]` is not a player, then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' otherwise 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.***
