This function simulates a game where players move around a grid and interact with each other and the environment. The game state is read from standard input, which contains the grid dimensions, the grid itself, and a series of commands. The function processes these commands, updating the game state accordingly, and prints out events such as player eliminations, goals, and the final score. The game continues until all commands have been processed, at which point the final score is printed.
