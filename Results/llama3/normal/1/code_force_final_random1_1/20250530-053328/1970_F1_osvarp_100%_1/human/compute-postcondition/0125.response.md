Postcondition: **The game state has been updated based on the given command and object. If the object is '.B', the elements dictionary has been updated such that the value of elements['.B'] is now nxt, and the allPlayers dictionary, goal list, and points list remain unchanged. If the object is not '.B', the program has checked if the current position is in a goal and updated the points list accordingly if the command is 'T', or updated the value of elements[obj] to nxt if the command is not 'T' and obj is a player. In all cases, the program maintains the integrity of the game state, ensuring that the elements dictionary, allPlayers dictionary, goal list, and points list are updated correctly based on the game logic.**
