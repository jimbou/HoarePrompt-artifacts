Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length of at least 2, `i` is 0, and `count` is 1 if the current value of `s[i]` is greater than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, otherwise `count` remains 0.***
