Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
* For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and initializes a counter `count` to 0.
* It then iterates over the characters in the string, checking if the current character is greater than the next character. If it is, it increments the `count` variable.
* After iterating over all characters, it prints the `count` plus 1. This is because the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string is equal to the number of times a character is greater than the next character, plus 1 (since the first piece is always needed).

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the output matches the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
