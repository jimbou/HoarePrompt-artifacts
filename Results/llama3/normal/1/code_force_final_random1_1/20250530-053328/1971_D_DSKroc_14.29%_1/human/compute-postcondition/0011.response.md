Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length of at least 3 and at most 500 inclusive, `i` is 2. If the current value of `s[i]` is greater than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is 3. Otherwise, `count` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `s[i]` is greater than the current value of `s[i + 1]`, then `count` is now 3. Otherwise, `count` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
