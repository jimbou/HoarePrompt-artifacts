To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. The loop will execute if `s` has at least 2 characters, since the loop iterates over the range of `len(s) - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length of at least 2 and at most 500 inclusive, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
