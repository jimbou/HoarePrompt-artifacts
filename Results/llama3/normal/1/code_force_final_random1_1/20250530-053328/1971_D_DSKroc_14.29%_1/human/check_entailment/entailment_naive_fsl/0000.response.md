Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program iterates through the string and counts the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0'. This is because each such occurrence requires a cut to separate the '1' and '0' into different pieces, which can then be rearranged to form a sorted binary string. The program then adds 1 to this count, because the remaining piece (which may be a single character) also needs to be counted.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When the string is already sorted (e.g., "00000000" or "11111111"), the program correctly outputs 1.
* When the string has alternating '0's and '1's (e.g., "01010101"), the program correctly outputs the number of cuts needed to separate the '0's and '1's.
* When the string has a mix of consecutive '0's and '1's (e.g., "11010"), the program correctly outputs the number of cuts needed to separate the '0's and '1's.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
