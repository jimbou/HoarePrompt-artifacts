Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :

Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  Reads two space-separated integers from the standard input and returns them as a map object containing two integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  Reads a line from standard input, splits it into two space-separated integers, and returns them as a list of two integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  This function generates a list of a specified length, where each element is the result of calling the function 'func_3()'. The length of the returned list is equal to the input 'rows_number', which is a positive integer.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  Reads a line from standard input, removes trailing bytes, and returns the resulting byte string, which is expected to contain a decodable string representing a valid input for the problem.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads a single line of text from standard input, removes any trailing newline characters, and decodes the bytes to a string using the default encoding, returning the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads a single line of input from stdin, expecting a space-separated list of two integers, and returns them as a list of two integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function generates a list of a specified length ('rows') by repeatedly calling another function ('func_7()') and returns this list. The list's length is equal to the input 'rows', but the exact values of its elements are determined by 'func_7()' and are not specified.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function reads a string from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or transformations, effectively echoing the input string.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function reads a positive integer from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or additional processing.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  Reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into two parts at the space character, and returns the resulting list of two strings.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key in a dictionary. It takes a dictionary `d` where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. If the list associated with the key `da` in `d` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list associated with the key `da` in `d`, updates the `processing` list, and recursively calls another function `func_12` to calculate the minimum rank. The function then updates the `rank` list with the calculated minimum rank and returns the minimum rank plus one.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b, and returns the GCD along with the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which are integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns 1, 0, and a. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function (func_13) to compute the GCD and coefficients.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function takes a list of integers `a`, its length `n`, and two non-negative integers `m` and `k` as input. It iterates through the list `a` and for each element less than `m`, it subtracts the difference from `k`. After the iteration, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function effectively checks if the total "deficit" of elements in `a` that are less than `m` can be compensated by `k`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  Calculates the sum of integer divisions of (n + k) by k squared for k from 1 to the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, and returns the result minus 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function writes the output of `func_15()` to the console, followed by a newline character, a number of times equal to the positive integer returned by `func_10()`.
