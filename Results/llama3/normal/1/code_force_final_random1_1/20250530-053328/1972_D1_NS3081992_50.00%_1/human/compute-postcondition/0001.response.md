Output State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, and the output of `func_15()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character.**

In this output state, the values of `func_10()` and `_` remain unchanged. The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` only affects the console output, printing the result of `func_15()` followed by a newline character. The return value of `func_15()` is not stored in any variable, so it is not included in the output state.
