Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n-1`. If the `n-1`th element of `a` is less than `m`, then the current value of `k` is `k` decreased by `m - a[n-1]`. The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 0.***
