Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a list of a specified length ('rows') by repeatedly calling another function ('func_7()') and returns this list.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, processing is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in d, da is an integer representing a key in d, and rank is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in d.

    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State: *`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `da` is an integer representing a key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, and `tmp` is 1000000000. The length of the list associated with the key `da` in `d` is more than 1.
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1

If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, then `tmp` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns an integer that is one more than the minimum of the original value of `tmp` and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, where `tmp` is an integer and `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` is a function that takes a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `di`, and a list `rank` as arguments.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key in a dictionary. It takes a dictionary `d` where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. If the list associated with the key `da` in `d` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list associated with the key `da` in `d`, updates the `processing` list, and recursively calls another function `func_12` to calculate the minimum rank. The function then updates the `rank` list with the calculated minimum rank and returns the minimum rank plus one.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return x, y, a
        #The program returns x which is 1, y which is 0, and a which is a positive integer.
    #State: a and b are positive integers, and b is not equal to 0
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns three values: y, x - a // b * y, and g. Here, y, x, and g are the return values of func_13(b, a % b), where a is a positive integer and b is a positive integer not equal to 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b, and returns the GCD along with the coefficients of Bézout's identity, which are integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns 1, 0, and a. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function (func_13) to compute the GCD and coefficients.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n is the length of the list a, m is a non-negative integer, and k is a non-negative integer.

        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n-1`. If the `n-1`th element of `a` is less than `m`, then `k` is decreased by `m - a[n-1]`.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: *`a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `m` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is less than 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers `a`, its length `n`, and two non-negative integers `m` and `k` as input. It iterates through the list `a` and for each element less than `m`, it subtracts the difference from `k`. After the iteration, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function effectively checks if the total "deficit" of elements in `a` that are less than `m` can be compensated by `k`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and m is a positive integer
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, i is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, ans is the original value of ans plus the sum of the integer divisions of (n + k) by k squared for k from 1 to the smallest integer greater than the square root of n.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the original value of ans plus the sum of the integer divisions of (n + k) by k squared for k from 1 to the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, minus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the sum of integer divisions of (n + k) by k squared for k from 1 to the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, and returns the result minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function func_10() returns a positive integer, and the function func_15() returns a value that can be converted to a string.
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The output of `func_15()` is written to the console followed by a newline character, `func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `_` is equal to the number of iterations minus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function writes the output of `func_15()` to the console, followed by a newline character, a number of times equal to the positive integer returned by `func_10()`.
