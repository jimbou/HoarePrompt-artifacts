Output State: **The program returns the original value of ans plus the sum of the integer divisions of (n + k) by k squared for k from 1 to the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, minus 1.**

In this output state, `ans` is the result of adding the original value of `ans` to the sum of the integer divisions of `(n + k)` by `k` squared, where `k` ranges from 1 to the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`. This result is then subtracted by 1.
