This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key in a dictionary. It takes a dictionary `d` where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, a list `processing` of integers, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers. If the list associated with the key `da` in `d` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list associated with the key `da` in `d`, updates the `processing` list, and recursively calls another function `func_12` to calculate the minimum rank. The function then updates the `rank` list with the calculated minimum rank and returns the minimum rank plus one.
