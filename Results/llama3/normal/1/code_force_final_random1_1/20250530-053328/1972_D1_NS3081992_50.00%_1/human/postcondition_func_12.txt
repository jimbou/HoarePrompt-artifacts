This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b, and returns the GCD along with the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns 1, 0, and a. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function (func_13) to compute the GCD and coefficients.
