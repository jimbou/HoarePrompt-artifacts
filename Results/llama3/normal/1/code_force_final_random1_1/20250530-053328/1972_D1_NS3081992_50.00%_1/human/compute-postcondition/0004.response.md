The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `func_10()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1. So for the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `func_10()` must return a positive integer greater than 2.
State: **The output of `func_15()` is written to the console followed by a newline character, `func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 2, and `_` is 2**
