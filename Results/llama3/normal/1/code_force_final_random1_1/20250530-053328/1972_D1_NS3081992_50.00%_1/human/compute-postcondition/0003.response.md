The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the output of `func_15()` to the console followed by a newline character. The initial state mentions that the output of `func_15()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character, which means this code does not change the output of `func_15()` but rather writes it to the console.

Output State: **The output of `func_15()` is written to the console followed by a newline character, `func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 1, and `_` is 1.**
