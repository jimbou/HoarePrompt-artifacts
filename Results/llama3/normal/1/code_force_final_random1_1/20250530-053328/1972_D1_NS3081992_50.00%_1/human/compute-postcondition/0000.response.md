The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and the function `func_10()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `func_10()` returns a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, the state of `_` is 0 (the first iteration) and `func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0**
