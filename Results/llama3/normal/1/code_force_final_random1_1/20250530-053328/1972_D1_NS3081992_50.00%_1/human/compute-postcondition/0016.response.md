Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `da` is an integer representing a key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d` where `rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`, `tmp` is an integer, and `di` is the last element in the list `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, then `tmp` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The dictionary `d`, the list `processing`, the key `da`, and the last element `di` in the list `d[da]` remain unchanged. The list `rank` is updated at index `da - 1` to be `tmp + 1`. The value of `tmp` is still an integer, and its value is updated to the minimum of its original value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` if `processing[di - 1]` is 0.
