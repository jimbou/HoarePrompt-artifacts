Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly handle the case when a and b are not coprime.

For example, when n = 10 and m = 8, the program returns 14, but the correct answer is 15. The pair (10, 2) is not counted by the program, but it satisfies the conditions.

The program only checks if a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b), but it does not check if a and b are coprime. If a and b are not coprime, the program will not count the pair (a, b) even if it satisfies the conditions.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when a and b are not coprime. One possible solution is to use the concept of the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b, and check if a + b is a multiple of the LCM of a and b.
