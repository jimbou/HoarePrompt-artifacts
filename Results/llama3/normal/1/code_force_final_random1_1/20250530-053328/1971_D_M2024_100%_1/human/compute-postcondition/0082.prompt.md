Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a = input()
    cut0 = 0
    cut1 = 0
    for i in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
            cut1 += 1
        if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
            cut0 += 1
    if cut0 == 0:
        print(cut1 + 1)
    else:
        print(cut0 + cut1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0. If the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a` is 0, then the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a` plus 1 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the number of times '0' is followed by '1' and the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a`, `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is not defined, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is not defined. If `cut0` is 0, the value of `cut1 + 1` is printed. Otherwise, the sum of `cut0` and `cut1` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), cut0 is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in a, cut1 is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a, i is len(a) - 1, _ is 1, t is not defined, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). If '0' is never followed by '1' in the string a, then the value of cut1 + 1 (which is equal to 1) is being printed. Otherwise, the sum of cut0 and cut1 (where cut0 is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in a, and cut1 is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a) is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
