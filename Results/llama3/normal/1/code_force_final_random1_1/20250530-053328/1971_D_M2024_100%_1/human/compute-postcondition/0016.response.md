Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 3, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `cut0` remains unchanged, `cut1` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `a` still consists of '0's and '1's with a length of at least 3. The value of `i` remains 2. The value of `t` is still between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The stdin still contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The value of `_` is still 0. The value of `cut0` remains unchanged. The value of `cut1` is increased by 1.
