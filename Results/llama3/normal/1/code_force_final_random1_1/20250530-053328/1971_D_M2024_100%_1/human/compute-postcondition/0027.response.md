Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0. If the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a` is 0, then the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a` plus 1 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the number of times '0' is followed by '1' and the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a` is printed.***
