Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `cut0` is 1, `cut1` is 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `t` is not defined, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cut0` being 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The current values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]` are still '0' and '1', respectively.
