Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 4 and 500 (inclusive). If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is 1 plus its previous value. If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 2 plus its previous value. Otherwise, `cut0` remains unchanged. `i` is 3, `_` is 1, `t` is not defined, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive).**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `a` remains unchanged, with a length between 4 and 500, consisting of '0's and '1's. The value of `cut0` is incremented by 1, regardless of the values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]`. The value of `cut1` remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `_`, and `t` remain the same, and the input in `stdin` remains unchanged.
