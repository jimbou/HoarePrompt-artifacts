Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 2, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 1 and `cut1` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `cut0` and `cut1` remain unchanged.***
