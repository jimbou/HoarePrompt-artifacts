Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 4 and 500 (inclusive). If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 1 plus its previous value. Otherwise, `cut0` remains unchanged. `cut1` is 1 plus its previous value, `i` is 3, `_` is 1, `t` is not defined, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive).**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `a` remains unchanged, with a length between 4 and 500 characters, consisting of '0's and '1's. The value of `cut0` is still dependent on the sequence of '0's and '1's in `a`. The value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1. The value of `i` is still 3, and the value of `_` is still 1. The variable `t` is still not defined. The standard input `stdin` still contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of '0's and '1's with a length between 1 and 500 characters.
