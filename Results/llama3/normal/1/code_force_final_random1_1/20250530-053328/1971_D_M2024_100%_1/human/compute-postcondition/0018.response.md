Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 3, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `cut0` is increased by 1, `cut1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged depending on the values of `a` at index `i` and `i+1`.**

In this output state, the value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `cut1` is still dependent on the values of `a` at index `i` and `i+1`, so its value may or may not have changed.
