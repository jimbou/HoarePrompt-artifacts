Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0. `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a`, and `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged. The loop variable `i` reaches the last index of the string `a`. The variables `cut0` and `cut1` are updated to count the total number of occurrences of '0' followed by '1' and '1' followed by '0' in the string `a`, respectively.
