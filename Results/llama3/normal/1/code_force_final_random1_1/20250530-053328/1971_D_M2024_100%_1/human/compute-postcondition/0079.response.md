The code prints the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`. `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in the string `a`, and `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`. Since `cut0` is not equal to 0, we know that there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in the string `a`. However, we cannot determine the exact values of `cut0` and `cut1` without knowing the specific string `a`. Therefore, the output will be the sum of these two counts.

Output: **the sum of the number of times '0' is followed by '1' and the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string a**
