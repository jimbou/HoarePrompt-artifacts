Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 2, `cut0` is 0, `cut1` is 1, `i` is 0, `t` is not defined, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is not defined. The current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cut1` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `a` still has a length of at least 2, with `a[i]` being '1' and `a[i + 1]` being '0'. The values of `cut0`, `i`, `t`, and the contents of stdin remain the same.
