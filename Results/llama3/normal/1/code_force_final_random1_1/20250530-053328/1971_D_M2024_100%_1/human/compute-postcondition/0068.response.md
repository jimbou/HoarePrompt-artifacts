Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 3 and 500 (inclusive). If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 1 plus its previous value. Otherwise, `cut0` remains unchanged. `cut1` is 1 if `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', otherwise `cut1` is 0. `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `t` is not defined, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive).***
