Postcondition: **a is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), cut0 is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in a, cut1 is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a, i is len(a) - 1, _ is 1, t is not defined, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). If '0' is never followed by '1' in the string a, then the value of cut1 + 1 (which is equal to 1) is being printed. Otherwise, the sum of cut0 and cut1 (where cut0 is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in a, and cut1 is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a) is being printed.**
