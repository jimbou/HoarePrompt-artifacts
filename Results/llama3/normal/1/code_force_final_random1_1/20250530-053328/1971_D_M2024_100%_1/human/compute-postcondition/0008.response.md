Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 2, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `cut0` is 1, `cut1` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cut0` being 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The current values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]` are still '0' and '1', respectively. The stdin still contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
