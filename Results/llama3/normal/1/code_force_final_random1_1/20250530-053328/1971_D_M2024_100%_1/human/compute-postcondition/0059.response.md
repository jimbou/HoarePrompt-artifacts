Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `cut0` is 0, `cut1` is 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `t` is not defined, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
