Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 3, `cut0` is 2 if the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', otherwise `cut0` is 1, `i` is 2, `t` is not defined, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is not defined, `cut1` is 1 plus its previous value if `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1 if the current character in string `a` is '1' and the next character is '0', otherwise it remains the same.
