Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program iterates through the string and counts the number of times '0' is followed by '1' (cut0) and the number of times '1' is followed by '0' (cut1). If cut0 is 0, it means the string is already sorted, so it prints cut1 + 1. Otherwise, it prints the sum of cut0 and cut1.

This logic is correct because the minimum number of pieces needed is equal to the number of times the string needs to be cut to separate the '0's and '1's, plus one (because the last piece is not a cut, but the remaining string). The program correctly calculates this number.

Correctness: **True**
