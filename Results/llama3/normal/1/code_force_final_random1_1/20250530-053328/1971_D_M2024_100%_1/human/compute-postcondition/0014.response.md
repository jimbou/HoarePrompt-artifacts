Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 3, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut0` is 2 and `cut1` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 2 and `cut1` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 1 and `cut1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cut0` and `cut1` remain unchanged.***
