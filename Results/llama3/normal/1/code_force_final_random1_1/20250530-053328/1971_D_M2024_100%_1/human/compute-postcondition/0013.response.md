Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 3, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut0` is 2 and `cut1` is 1. Otherwise, if the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 2 and `cut1` is 0. Otherwise, `cut0` is 1 and `cut1` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1, regardless of the previous values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `cut0` and `cut1` are still dependent on the values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]`, but `cut0` is now at least 1, and if the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut0` is 2.
