Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 3, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0. If `a` at index `i` is '0' and `a` at index `i+1` is '1', then `cut0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `cut0` remains unchanged. `cut1` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged depending on the values of `a` at index `i` and `i+1`.***
