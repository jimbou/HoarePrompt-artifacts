Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 3, `cut0` is 3 if the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', otherwise `cut0` is 2, `i` is 2, `t` is not defined, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is not defined. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is 1 plus its previous value. Otherwise, `cut1` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `a` remains unchanged, the value of `cut0` is incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cut0` is now 3 if the current character in `a` is '0' and the next character is '1', otherwise it is 2. The value of `cut1` remains the same as before, unless the current character in `a` is '1' and the next character is '0', in which case it is incremented by 1. The input stream `stdin` still contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
