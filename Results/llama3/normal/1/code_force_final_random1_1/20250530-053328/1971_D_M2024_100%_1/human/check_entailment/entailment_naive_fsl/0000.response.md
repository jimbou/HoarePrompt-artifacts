Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program iterates through the string and counts the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' (cut1) and the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' (cut0). If cut0 is 0, it means that the string is already sorted, so the program prints cut1 + 1, which is the minimum number of pieces needed. Otherwise, the program prints cut0 + cut1, which is the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the cases where the string is already sorted, where the string has only one '0' or one '1', and where the string has multiple '0's and '1's. The program also correctly handles the edge cases where the string has only one character or where the string is empty.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
