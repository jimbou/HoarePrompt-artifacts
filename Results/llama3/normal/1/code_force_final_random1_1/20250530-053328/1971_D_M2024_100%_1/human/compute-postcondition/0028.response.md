To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` needs to remain the same.

So, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 1
* `t` is still an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)

The other variables, `a`, `i`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1**
