Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 3 and 500 (inclusive), `cut0` is 1 if `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', otherwise `cut0` is 0, `cut1` is 1 if `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', otherwise `cut1` is 1 plus its previous value, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `t` is not defined, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive)**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `a` remains unchanged, the conditions for `cut0` and `cut1` are still the same, but the value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `_`, and `t` are unchanged, and the input in `stdin` remains the same.
