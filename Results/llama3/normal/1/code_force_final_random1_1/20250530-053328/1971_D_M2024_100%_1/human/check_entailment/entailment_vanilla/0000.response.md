Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the input string and counting the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' (cut1) and the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' (cut0). 

However, the program has a logical error. The correct approach should be to count the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' or a '0' is followed by a '1', because these are the points where a cut is needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

The program also incorrectly handles the case when cut0 is 0. In this case, it prints cut1 + 1, which is incorrect because it doesn't account for the case when the string is already sorted.

A correct approach would be to count the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' or a '0' is followed by a '1', and then print the total count plus 1, because we need at least one piece even if no cuts are needed.

Correctness: **False**
