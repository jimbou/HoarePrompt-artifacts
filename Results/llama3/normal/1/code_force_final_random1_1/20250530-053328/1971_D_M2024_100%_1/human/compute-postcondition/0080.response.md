The code prints the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`, where `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in the string `a`, and `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`. Since the exact string `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cut0` and `cut1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the total number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' or a '1' is followed by a '0' in the string `a`.

Output: **a is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), cut0 is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in a, cut1 is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a, i is len(a) - 1, _ is 1, t is not defined, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). cut0 is not equal to 0, and the sum of cut0 and cut1 (where cut0 is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in a, and cut1 is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a) is being printed**
