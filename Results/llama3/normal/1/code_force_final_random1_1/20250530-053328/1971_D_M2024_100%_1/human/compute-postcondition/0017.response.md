Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 3, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `cut0` remains unchanged. If `a` at index `i` is '1' and `a` at index `i+1` is '0', then `cut1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `cut1` remains unchanged.***
