Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 3 and 500 (inclusive), `cut0` is 1 plus its previous value, `cut1` is 1 if `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', otherwise `cut1` is 0, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `t` is not defined, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is 1 plus its previous value. Otherwise, `cut1` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `a` remains unchanged, `cut0` is incremented by 1, the value of `cut1` depends on the values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]`, the values of `i`, `_`, and `t` remain unchanged, and the input in `stdin` remains the same.
