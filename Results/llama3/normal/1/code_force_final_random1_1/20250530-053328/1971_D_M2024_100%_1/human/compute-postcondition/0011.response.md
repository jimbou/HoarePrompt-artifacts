Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 3, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 1 and `cut1` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `cut0` and `cut1` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `a` remains unchanged, the index `i` is still 1, the number of test cases `t` is still between 1 and 500, and the input buffer still contains `t-1` strings of '0's and '1's. The variable `_` is still 0. The values of `cut0` and `cut1` are updated based on the current values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]`. If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 1 and `cut1` is now 1 (because it was incremented by 1). Otherwise, the values of `cut0` and `cut1` remain the same.
