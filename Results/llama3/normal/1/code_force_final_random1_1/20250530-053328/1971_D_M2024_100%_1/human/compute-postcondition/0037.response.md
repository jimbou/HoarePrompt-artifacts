The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `a` must still be a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 2.
State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 2, `cut0` is 1 if the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', otherwise `cut0` is 0, `cut1` is 1 if the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', otherwise `cut1` is 0, `i` is 1, `t` is not defined, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is not defined.**
