Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 2, `cut0` is 1 if the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', otherwise `cut0` is 0, `i` is 1, `t` is not defined, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is not defined. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is 1 plus the value it had before. Otherwise, `cut1` remains unchanged.***
