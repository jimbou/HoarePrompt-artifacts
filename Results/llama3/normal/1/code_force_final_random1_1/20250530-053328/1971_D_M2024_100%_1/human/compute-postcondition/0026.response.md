The code prints the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`, where `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in the string `a`, and `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`. Since `cut0` is not equal to 0, the sum will be at least 1.
Output: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0. `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a`, and `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`. `cut0` is not equal to 0, and the sum of cut0 and cut1 is being printed**
