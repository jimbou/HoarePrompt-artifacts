The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not defined, `t` is not defined, stdin contains t-2 strings. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 1 and stdin contains t-1 strings.
State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a`, `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `_` is 1, `t` is not defined, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive)**
