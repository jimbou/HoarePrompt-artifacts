Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `a` is a string of '0's and '1's with a length between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
* `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a`.
* `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`.
* `i` is `len(a) - 1`, which means it's the index of the last character in the string `a`.
* `t` is not defined, but it's not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
* `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), but this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* `_` is not defined, but it's not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
* `cut0` is larger than 0, which means there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in the string `a`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(cut0 + cut1)`

The print statement adds the values of `cut0` and `cut1` and prints the result.

Since `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a`, and `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`, the sum `cut0 + cut1` represents the total number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' or a '1' is followed by a '0' in the string `a`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the total number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' or a '1' is followed by a '0' in the string `a`.

Output: **the total number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' or a '1' is followed by a '0' in the string a**
