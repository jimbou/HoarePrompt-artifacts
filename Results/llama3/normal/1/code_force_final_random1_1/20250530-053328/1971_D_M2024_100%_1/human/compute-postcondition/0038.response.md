Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 2, `cut0` is 1 if the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', otherwise `cut0` is 0, `cut1` is 1 plus the value it had before, `i` is 1, `t` is not defined, stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `a` remains unchanged, the value of `cut0` is still dependent on the current and next characters in `a`, the value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1, the index `i` is still 1, the variable `t` is still undefined, and the input buffer still contains t-2 strings of '0's and '1's.
