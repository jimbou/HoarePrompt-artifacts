The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least 3 characters.
State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's with length at least 3, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 1 and `cut1` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `cut0` and `cut1` remain unchanged.**
