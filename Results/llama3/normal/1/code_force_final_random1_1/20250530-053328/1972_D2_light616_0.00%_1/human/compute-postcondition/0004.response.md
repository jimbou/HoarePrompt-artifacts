Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, stdin is empty, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

The code snippet is empty, so there are no changes to the variables or the state of the program. The function `func_1()` has already been executed, and its effects are still present. The values of `t` and `_` remain the same, and the stdin is still empty.
