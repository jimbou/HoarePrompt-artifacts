The value of `y` is incremented by 1, so `y` is now 3. The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is now 1. The minimum of `n / ((1 + 2) * 1)` and `m // ((1 + 2) * 2)` is calculated as `min(n / 3, m // 6)`. The value of `cnt` is increased by this minimum value. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 6, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is increased by `min(n / 3, m // 6)`.**
