The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, stdin is empty, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**
