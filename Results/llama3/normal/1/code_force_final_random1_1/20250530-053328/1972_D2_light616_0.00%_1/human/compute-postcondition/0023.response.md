Postcondition: ***`cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`, and `x` is increased by 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, and `y` is 1, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Additionally, if the current value of `x` and `y` are relatively prime, `cnt` is also increased by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.***
