Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`, and `x` is increased by 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, and `y` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `cnt` remains the same as it was before, which is the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`. The value of `x` is still increased by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`. Additionally, a new variable `y` is introduced and assigned the value 1.
