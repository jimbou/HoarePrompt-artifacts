Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1, and if the current value of `x` and `y` are coprime, `cnt` is increased by min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)), `x` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, `y` is 2, and `m` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` is increased by the sum of the minimum of `n` divided by `k` and `m` divided by the product of `k` and `k-1`, for all positive integers `k` that are less than or equal to the minimum of the square roots of `n` and `m`, and are relatively prime to `k-1`. Additionally, if `x` and `y` are coprime, `cnt` is further increased by the minimum of `n` divided by the product of `x+y` and `x`, and `m` divided by the product of `x+y` and `y`. The value of `x` is increased by 1, and `n` is still greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`. The value of `y` is now 2, and `m` is still greater than or equal to `x+1`.
