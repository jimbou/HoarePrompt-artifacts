To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `x` and `n` in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `x * x <= n`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is increased by 1. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`.

State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`, and `x` is increased by 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`**
