Output State: **cnt** is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1. `x` is increased by the number of times `x` and `y` are coprime, `y` is increased by the number of times the loop executes, `n` is greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x` plus `x`, and `m` is greater than or equal to `x + 1` plus `y`.

This output state means that the loop will continue to execute until the conditions in the loop head are no longer met. During each iteration, the value of `cnt` will be increased by the sum of the minimum of `n` divided by `k` and `m` divided by `k * (k - 1)`, where `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`. The value of `x` will be increased by 1 each time `x` and `y` are coprime, and the value of `y` will be increased by 1 each time the loop executes. The values of `n` and `m` will be updated to be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x` plus `x`, and `x + 1` plus `y`, respectively.
