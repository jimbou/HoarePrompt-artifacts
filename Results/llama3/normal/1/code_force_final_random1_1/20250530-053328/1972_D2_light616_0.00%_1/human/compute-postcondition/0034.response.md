Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1, `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, and `y` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` has been incremented by 1. The value of `cnt` remains the same as it was before the execution of the code. The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`. The value of `y` is still equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus 1.
