To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `x` and `n`. The loop condition is `x * x <= n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cnt` is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1.
- `x` is increased by 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`.
- `y` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus 1.

Since `x` has been increased by 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of this new value of `x`. The condition `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x` already ensures this, so no further adjustments are needed for `n` based on the given information.

However, to ensure clarity and adherence to the format, we should explicitly state that `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, which is now `x+1`. But since the statement about `n` already implies this condition for the new value of `x`, we don't need to adjust the description of `n`'s state.

Therefore, the state that allows the loop to execute one more time, focusing only on adjustments necessary for the loop head variables (`x` and `n`), is as follows:

State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1, `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, and `y` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus 1.**
