Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1, `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, and `y` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been reset to 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is still dependent on the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1. The value of `x` is still increased by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`.
