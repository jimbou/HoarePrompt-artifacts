Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`, plus `min(n / ((x + 3) * x), m // ((x + 3) * 3))`, `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `(x + 2)^2 + (x + 2) * 3`, `y` is 3, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `(x + 5) * 3`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n` divided by the product of `x` and the sum of `x` and `y`, and `m` divided by the product of `y` and the sum of `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is increased by 1. The constraints on `n` and `m` are updated to reflect the new value of `x`. The value of `y` remains unchanged at 3.
