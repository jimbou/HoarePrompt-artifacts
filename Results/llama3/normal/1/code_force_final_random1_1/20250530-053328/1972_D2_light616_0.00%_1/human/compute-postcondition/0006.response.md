Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, stdin is empty, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

The code snippet provided is an empty function call `func_1()`. Since the function has already been executed, there is no additional impact on the program state. The values of the variables `t` and `_` remain unchanged, and the stdin remains empty. The function `func_1()` has already been executed, so its execution does not affect the state.
