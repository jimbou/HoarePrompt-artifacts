Output State: **cnt is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1. x is increased by the number of iterations of the loop, n must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of x, and y is equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of cnt is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1. The value of x is increased by the number of iterations of the loop, and n must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of x. The value of y is equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus 1.
