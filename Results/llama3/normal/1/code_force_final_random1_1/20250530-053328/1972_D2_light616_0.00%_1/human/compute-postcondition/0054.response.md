The code prints the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`. The value of `cnt` depends on the values of `n` and `m`, which are not explicitly provided in the initial state.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1)**
