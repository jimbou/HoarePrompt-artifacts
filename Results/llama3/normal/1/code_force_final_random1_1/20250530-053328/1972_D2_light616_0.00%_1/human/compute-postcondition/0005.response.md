To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The objects involved are `_` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` needs to be greater than the new value of `_`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `_` is 2, and `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive).

The other variables, `stdin` and the function `func_1()`, are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, stdin is empty, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**
