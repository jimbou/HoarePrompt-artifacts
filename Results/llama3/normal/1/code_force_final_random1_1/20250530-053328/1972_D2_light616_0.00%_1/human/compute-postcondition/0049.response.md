Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1. If `x` and `y` are coprime, `cnt` is increased by min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)). `x` is increased by 1, `y` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x` plus `x`, `m` is greater than or equal to `x + 1` plus `y`, and `x` and `y` are coprime. If `x` and `y` are not coprime, the values of `cnt`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. The values of `cnt`, `x`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The conditions for `cnt`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` are still valid, but `y` has been updated to 4.
