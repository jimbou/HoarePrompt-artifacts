Postcondition: ***`cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`. If `x` and `y` are relatively prime, `cnt` is further increased by `min(n / ((x + 3) * x), m // ((x + 3) * 3))`. `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `(x + 1)^2 + (x + 1) * 3` if `x` and `y` are not relatively prime, or `(x + 2)^2 + (x + 2) * 3` if they are. `y` is 3, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `(x + 4) * 3` if `x` and `y` are not relatively prime, or `(x + 5) * 3` if they are.***
