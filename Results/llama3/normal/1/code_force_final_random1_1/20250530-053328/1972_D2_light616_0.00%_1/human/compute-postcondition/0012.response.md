According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`. For the loop to execute again, the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` must be true.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `m` is greater than or equal to 6. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the states as follows:

* `n` must be greater than or equal to `(x + y) * x`, which is `(1 + 3) * 1 = 4`. So, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
* `m` must be greater than or equal to `(x + y) * y`, which is `(1 + 3) * 3 = 12`. So, `m` must be greater than or equal to 12.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is increased by `min(n / 3, m // 6)`**
