Postcondition: ***`cnt` is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1. If the current value of `x` and `y` are coprime, `cnt` is increased by min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)). `x` is increased by 1 if `x` and `y` are coprime, otherwise it remains unchanged. `n` is greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x` plus `x`, `y` is 2, and `m` is greater than or equal to `x + 1` plus `y`.***
