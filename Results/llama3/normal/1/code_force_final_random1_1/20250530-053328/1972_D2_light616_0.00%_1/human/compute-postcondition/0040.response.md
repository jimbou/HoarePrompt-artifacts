Postcondition: ***`cnt`, `x`, `n`, `y`, `m` are integers. `cnt` is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1. `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, `y` is 1, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If the current value of `x` and `y` are coprime, `cnt` is increased by min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)).***
