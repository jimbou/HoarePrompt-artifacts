Output State: **cnt is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1, and x is increased to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the count `cnt` is increased by the sum of the minimum of `n` divided by `k` and `m` divided by `k` times `k-1` for all positive integers `k` that are less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k-1`. The variable `x` is increased to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m` plus 1. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
