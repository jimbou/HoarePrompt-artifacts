Postcondition: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`. If `x` and `y` are relatively prime, `cnt` is also increased by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`. If `x` and `y` are relatively prime, `cnt` is further increased by `min(n / ((x + 2) * x), m // ((x + 2) * 2))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`. `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, `y` is 2, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `2x + 2`.**
