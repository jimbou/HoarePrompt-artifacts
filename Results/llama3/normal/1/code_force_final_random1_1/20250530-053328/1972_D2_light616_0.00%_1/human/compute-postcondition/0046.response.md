To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.

The loop head is: `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:`

We need to ensure that both conditions are still true after the previous iteration.

1. `(x + y) * x <= n`:
Since `x` is increased by 1 if `x` and `y` are coprime, we need to consider two cases:

a. If `x` and `y` are coprime, `x` is increased by 1. In this case, we need to ensure that `(x + 1 + y) * (x + 1) <= n`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x` plus `x`, we can conclude that `n` is greater than or equal to `(x + 1) * (x + 1) + (x + 1)`. This condition is already satisfied, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.

b. If `x` and `y` are not coprime, `x` remains unchanged. In this case, the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` is still true, and no adjustment is needed for `n`.

2. `(x + y) * y <= m`:
Since `y` is constant (3), we only need to ensure that `m` is still greater than or equal to `(x + y) * y`. Since `m` is greater than or equal to `x + 1` plus `y`, we can conclude that `m` is greater than or equal to `(x + 3) * 3`. This condition is already satisfied, so no adjustment is needed for `m`.

However, we need to ensure that `x` and `y` are still coprime, because if they are not, `x` will not be increased, and the loop condition might not be satisfied. To ensure this, we can add a constraint that `x` and `y` are coprime.

State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1. If the current value of `x` and `y` are coprime, `cnt` is increased by min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)). `x` is increased by 1, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x` plus `x`, `m` is greater than or equal to `x + 1` plus `y`, and `x` and `y` are coprime.**
