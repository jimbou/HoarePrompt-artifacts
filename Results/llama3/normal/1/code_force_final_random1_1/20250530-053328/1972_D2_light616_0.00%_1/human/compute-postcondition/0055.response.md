Output: **cnt is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1, and x is increased to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m plus 1, and cnt is printed**
