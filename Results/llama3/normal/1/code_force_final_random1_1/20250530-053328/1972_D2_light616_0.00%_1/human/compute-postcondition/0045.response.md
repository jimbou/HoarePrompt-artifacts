Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1. If the current value of `x` and `y` are coprime, `cnt` is increased by min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)). `x` is increased by 1 if `x` and `y` are coprime, otherwise it remains unchanged. `n` is greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x` plus `x`, `y` is 3, and `m` is greater than or equal to `x + 1` plus `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` has been increased by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged, but the conditions that were true before the code was executed are still true. The value of `cnt` is still increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1. If the current value of `x` and `y` are coprime, `cnt` is increased by min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)). The value of `x` is still increased by 1 if `x` and `y` are coprime, otherwise it remains unchanged. The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x` plus `x`, and the value of `m` is still greater than or equal to `x + 1` plus `y`.
