To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement and adjust the states accordingly.

The loop condition is `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`. Given the current states:

* `cnt` has been increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`. (This state doesn't affect the loop condition directly)
* `x` is increased by 1
* `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`
* `y` is 3
* `m` must be greater than or equal to `2x + 2`

We need to ensure that the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are still met.

Since `x` has been increased by 1, we need to adjust the states of `n` and `m` to ensure the conditions are still satisfied.

For the first condition `(x + y) * x <= n`, since `x` has increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x` plus the product of `y` and the new value of `x`. So, `n` must be greater than or equal to `(x + 1)^2 + (x + 1) * y`.

For the second condition `(x + y) * y <= m`, since `y` is constant (3), we only need to ensure that `m` is greater than or equal to `(x + 1 + y) * y`, which simplifies to `m` being greater than or equal to `(x + 4) * 3`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`. `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `(x + 1)^2 + (x + 1) * y`, `y` is 3, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `(x + 4) * 3`**
