Output State: `cnt` is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1. `x` is increased by the number of times the loop executes, `n` is greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, `y` is the number of times the loop executes plus 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to `x + 1` plus `y`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the counter `cnt` is increased by the sum of the minimum of `n` divided by `k` and `m` divided by `k` times `k-1` for all positive integers `k` less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k-1`. The value of `x` is increased by the number of times the loop executes, `n` is greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, `y` is the number of times the loop executes plus 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to `x + 1` plus `y`.
