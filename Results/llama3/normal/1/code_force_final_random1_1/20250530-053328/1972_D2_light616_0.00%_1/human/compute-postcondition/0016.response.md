Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `cnt` is increased by the sum of the minimum of `n` divided by `k` and `m` divided by `k` times `k - 1`, for all positive integers `k` that are less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`. This means that the loop will iterate over all possible values of `k` that satisfy the conditions, and for each `k`, it will add the minimum of `n / k` and `m // (k * (k - 1))` to `cnt`.
