Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`, and `x` is increased by 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, and `y` is 1, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `x + 1`. The current value of `x` and `y` are relatively prime, meaning their greatest common divisor is 1, and `cnt` is also increased by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been increased by the minimum of `n` divided by the product of `x` and `x + y`, and `m` divided by the product of `y` and `x + y`. The other conditions remain the same, including the relationship between `x` and `y` being relatively prime, and the constraints on `n` and `m` based on the value of `x`.
