Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is `t-1`, stdin is empty, and the function `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `t` will be the same as it was initially (since the loop doesn't modify `t`), the variable `_` will have the value of `t-1` (since it increments by 1 in each iteration), the standard input `stdin` remains empty (since the loop doesn't interact with it), and the function `func_1()` will have been executed a number of times equal to the initial value of `t`.
