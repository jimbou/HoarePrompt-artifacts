Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`, and `x` is increased by 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, and `y` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
        cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
    y += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`, and `x` is increased by 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, and `y` is 2, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Additionally, if the current value of `x` and `y` are relatively prime, `cnt` is also increased by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`. If `x` and `y` are relatively prime, `cnt` is also increased by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`. If `x` and `y` are relatively prime, `cnt` is further increased by `min(n / ((x + 2) * x), m // ((x + 2) * 2))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`. `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, `y` is 3, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `2x + 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`. If `x` and `y` are relatively prime, `cnt` is further increased by `min(n / ((x + 3) * x), m // ((x + 3) * 3))`. `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `(x + 1)^2 + (x + 1) * 3` if `x` and `y` are not relatively prime, or `(x + 2)^2 + (x + 2) * 3` if they are. `y` is 4, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `(x + 4) * 3` if `x` and `y` are not relatively prime, or `(x + 5) * 3` if they are.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
