Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / ((x + 2) * x), m // ((x + 2) * 2))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`, and if the current value of `x` and `y` are relatively prime, `cnt` is also increased by `min(n / ((x + 2) * x), m // ((x + 2) * 2))`, `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, `y` is 2, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `2x + 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n` divided by the product of `x + 2` and `x`, and `m` divided by the product of `x + 2` and 2, for all positive integers `k` that meet certain conditions. The value of `x` is increased by 1, and the values of `n` and `m` are constrained to be greater than or equal to certain expressions involving `x`. The value of `y` remains 2.
