Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1, plus min(n / ((x + 1) + 3) * (x + 1), m // ((x + 1) + 3) * 3). `x` is increased by 1, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x` plus `x`, `m` is greater than or equal to `x + 2` plus `y`, and `x + 1` and `y` are coprime.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been increased by the minimum of `n` divided by the product of `x + 1` and `x + 3`, and `m` divided by the product of `x + 1` and `3`, because `x` has been increased by 1 and `y` is 3. The values of `n` and `m` are still greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x` plus `x`, and `x + 2` plus `y`, respectively. The coprimality of `x + 1` and `y` is still maintained.
