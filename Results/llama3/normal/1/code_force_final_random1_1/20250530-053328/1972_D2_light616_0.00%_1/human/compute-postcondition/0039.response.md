Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1))) for all positive integers k such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of n and the square root of m, and k is relatively prime to k - 1, plus min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)), `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the square of the new value of `x`, `y` is 1, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `x + 1`. The current value of `x` and `y` are coprime, meaning they have no common divisors other than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been increased by the minimum of `n` divided by the product of `x` and `x+y`, and `m` divided by the product of `y` and `x+y`. The value of `x` has been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `y`, and `m` remain the same, but the constraints on them are still valid. The current values of `x` and `y` are still coprime.
