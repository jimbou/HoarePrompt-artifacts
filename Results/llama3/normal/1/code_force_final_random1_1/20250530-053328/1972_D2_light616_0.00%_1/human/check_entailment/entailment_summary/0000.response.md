Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b, given two positive integers n and m.

Function `func_1()` calculates and prints the sum of minimum values between n/k and m/(k*(k-1)) for all positive integers k less than or equal to the minimum of the square roots of n and m, where k is relatively prime to k-1. This is equivalent to counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

Function `func_2()` reads an integer from standard input and executes `func_1()` that many times. This is equivalent to running multiple test cases.

Since `func_1()` correctly calculates the desired count and `func_2()` runs `func_1()` the correct number of times, the program as a whole meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
