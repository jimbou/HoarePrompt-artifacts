Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a specific problem, which involves calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying certain conditions. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the sum of minimum values between `n/k` and `m/(k*(k-1))` for all positive integers `k` less than or equal to the minimum of the square roots of `n` and `m`, where `k` is relatively prime to `k-1`. This function takes two positive integers `n` and `m` as input and prints the calculated sum.

`func_2` reads an integer `t` from standard input and executes `func_1` that many times.

The problem statement guarantees that the sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases do not exceed `2 * 10^6`. This implies that the values of `n` and `m` are within the range of `1` to `2 * 10^6`.

The program uses a while loop to iterate over the possible values of `x` (which represents `k` in the problem statement) and calculates the sum of minimum values between `n/k` and `m/(k*(k-1))` for each `k`. The loop iterates until `x` exceeds the minimum of the square roots of `n` and `m`.

The program also uses the `math.gcd` function to check if `k` is relatively prime to `k-1`.

Based on the problem statement and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
