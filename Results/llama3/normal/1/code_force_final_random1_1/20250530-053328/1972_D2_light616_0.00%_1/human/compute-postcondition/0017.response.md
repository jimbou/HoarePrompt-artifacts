Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of `min(n / k, m // (k * (k - 1)))` for all positive integers `k` such that `k` is less than or equal to the minimum of the square root of `n` and the square root of `m`, and `k` is relatively prime to `k - 1`, and `x` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` remains the same as in the initial state, as the code does not modify it. The value of `x`, however, is incremented by 1. The other variables, `n` and `m`, are not affected by the code and their values remain unchanged.
