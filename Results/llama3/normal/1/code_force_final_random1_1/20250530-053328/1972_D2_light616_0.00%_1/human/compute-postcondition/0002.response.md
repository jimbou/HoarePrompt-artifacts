Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, stdin is empty, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

The code calls the function `func_1()`, which means that the function's body will be executed. However, since the function's definition is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables. Therefore, we can only state that the function has been executed, without specifying any changes to the variables. The values of `t` and `_` remain the same, and the stdin remains empty.
