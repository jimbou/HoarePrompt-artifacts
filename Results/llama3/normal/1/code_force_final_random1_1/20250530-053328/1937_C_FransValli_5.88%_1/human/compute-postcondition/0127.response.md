The code prints a string that starts with '?' followed by the value of `k` which is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `best` which is either 2 or 0 depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `k` again, and finally followed by the value of `i` which is 3.
Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 3 (where k is either n-1 or n-2 depending on the value of res, and best is either 2 or 0 depending on the value of res)**
