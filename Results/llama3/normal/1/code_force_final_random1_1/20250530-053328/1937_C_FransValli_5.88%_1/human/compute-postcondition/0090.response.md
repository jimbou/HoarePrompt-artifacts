To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not explicitly used in the given state. However, the loop condition depends on the value returned by `int(input())`, which is not directly mentioned in the state.

From the given state, we know that `stdin` contains at least 1 fewer test case. This implies that the input has been consumed partially, and there is at least one more test case left.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

* The loop variable `_` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, so we cannot adjust it directly.
* The loop condition depends on the value returned by `int(input())`, which is not directly mentioned in the state. However, we know that there is at least one more test case left in `stdin`.

Based on this analysis, the only adjustment we can make is to the state of `stdin`, which should reflect that there is at least one more test case left.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than its original value, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is a string from the input, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `k` is 1, `best` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case**
