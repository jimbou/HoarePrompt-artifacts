Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `res` is the input from stdin, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is "<" otherwise `k` is `n-2`, `best` is unknown, stdin contains at least 0 test case, and this is printed: "? 0 [k] 0 [i]" where [k] is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on whether `res` is "<" or not, and [i] is `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, the value of `k` will be either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the last input from stdin, and the loop will have printed a string in the format "? 0 [k] 0 [i]" where [k] is the value of `k` and [i] is `n`. The values of `n`, `best`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
