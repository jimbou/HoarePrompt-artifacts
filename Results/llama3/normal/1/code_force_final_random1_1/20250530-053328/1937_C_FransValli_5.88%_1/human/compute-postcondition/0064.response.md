Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `res` is a string from the input, `k` is 4, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case. If `res` is '<', then `k` was 3. Otherwise, `k` was 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 4, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the conditional statement about `k` being 3 or 1 based on the value of `res` is no longer applicable, as `k` has been reassigned to 4.
