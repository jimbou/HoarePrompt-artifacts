Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, if `res` is '<', then `k` is 2, otherwise `k` is 1, `res` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case, and this is printed: ? 0 1 0 2. If `res` is '<', then nothing is printed, otherwise ? 0 1 0 3 is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is updated to the input string. If `res` is '<', then `k` is updated to 2, otherwise `k` remains 1. The other variables `n` and `i` are not affected. The stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case because one input is consumed by the `input()` function. The printed output depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', nothing is printed, otherwise ? 0 1 0 3 is printed.
