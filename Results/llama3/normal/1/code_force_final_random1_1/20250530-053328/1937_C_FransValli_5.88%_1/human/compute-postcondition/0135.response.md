Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than its original value, `i` is `n`, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<' otherwise `k` is `n-2`, `best` is `n-1` if `res` is '<' otherwise `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 0 test case, and '?' followed by the value of `k` which is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `best` which is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `k` again, and finally followed by the value of `i` which is `n` has been printed, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `k` which is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `best` which is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times. The loop will continue to execute until there are no more test cases in stdin, at which point the loop will terminate. The final output state will reflect the values of the variables after the last iteration of the loop.
