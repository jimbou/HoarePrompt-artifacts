Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the input from stdin, `k` is 2 if `res` is "<" otherwise `k` is 1, `best` is unknown, stdin contains at least 1 test case, and this is printed: "? 0 [k] 0 [i]" where [k] is 2 if `res` is "<" otherwise [k] is 1 and [i] is 3**

The value of `res` is updated to the input from stdin, which can be any string. The value of `k` is still dependent on the value of `res`, so it remains either 2 or 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
