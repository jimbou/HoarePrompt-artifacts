To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than its original value and greater than 1.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, `res`, `k`, and `best`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

The state of `stdin` is also not part of the loop head, but we can infer that it still contains at least 1 fewer test case, as the loop has executed once.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than its original value and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `res` is a string from the input, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `k` is 1, `best` is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case.**
