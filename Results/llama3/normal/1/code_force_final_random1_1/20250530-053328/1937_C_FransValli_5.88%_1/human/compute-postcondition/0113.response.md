To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

Given that `i` is initially `n`, for the loop to start executing, `i` must be within the range defined by the loop, which means `i` should be 1 (the starting point of the range) for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is the input from stdin, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is "<" otherwise `k` is `n-2`, `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 0 test case**
