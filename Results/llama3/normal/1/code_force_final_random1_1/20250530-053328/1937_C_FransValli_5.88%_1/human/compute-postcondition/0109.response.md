Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `res` is the new input from stdin, `k` is 4, `best` is unknown, stdin contains at least 0 test case, and this is printed: ? 0 [4] 0 [4]**.

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 4, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The printed statement also reflects the new value of `k` and `i`, which are both 4.
