The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i`, followed by a flush operation to ensure the output is displayed immediately.

Based on the precondition, the value of `k` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `k` is `n-1`, otherwise `k` is 1. The value of `best` also depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 2, otherwise `best` is 0.

The value of `i` is given as 3.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `k` and `best`. However, we can describe their values based on the given conditions.

Output: **? (question mark), (n-1 if res is '<', otherwise 1), (2 if res is '<', otherwise 0), (n-1 if res is '<', otherwise 1), 3**
