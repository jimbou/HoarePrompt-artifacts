Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than its original value and greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is a string from the input, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `k` is 1, `best` is 2 if `res` is '<', otherwise `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to a new string from the input. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `best` remain the same as before, but their relationships with `res` have been updated. The stdin now contains at least one fewer test case, indicating that one test case has been processed.
