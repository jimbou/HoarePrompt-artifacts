Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `res` is a string from the input, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case. If `res` is '<', then `k` is 3. Otherwise, `k` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to a new string from the input. The values of `n`, `i`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains at least 1 fewer test case, indicating that one test case has been consumed by the input operation. The conditional relationship between `res` and `k` still holds, meaning that if `res` is '<', then `k` is 3, otherwise, `k` is 1.
