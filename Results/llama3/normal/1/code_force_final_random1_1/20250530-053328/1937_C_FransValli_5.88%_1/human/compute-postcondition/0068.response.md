The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1` does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than its original value and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is a string from the input, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `k` is 1, `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case.**
