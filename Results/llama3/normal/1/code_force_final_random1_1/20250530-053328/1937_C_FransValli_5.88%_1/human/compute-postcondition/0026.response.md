Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, `res` is a string from the input, `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case, and a series of ? 0 `k` 0 `i` is printed for each iteration of the loop, and this is printed: ? [k] [best] [k] [i]**.

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to a string from the input, which was previously unknown. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n`, `i`, `k`, and `best` are still valid. The stdin now contains at least one fewer test case, indicating that one test case has been processed. The printing of the series of ? 0 `k` 0 `i` and ? [k] [best] [k] [i] is still ongoing, with the same values of `k`, `best`, and `i`.
