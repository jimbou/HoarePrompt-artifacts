Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `res` is a string from the input, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case, `k` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `res`, and either ? 0 1 0 2 or ? 0 1 0 3 is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is updated to be the string from the input. The value of `k` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `k` is 2 and ? 0 1 0 2 is printed. Otherwise, `k` is 3 and ? 0 1 0 3 is printed. The values of `n` and `i` remain the same. The stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case since one test case has been read.
