Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n followed by a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, it finds the maximum and second maximum elements in the permutation and prints them in the format '! k best', where k is the maximum element and best is the second maximum element. The function also prints intermediate queries in the format '? k best k i' to determine the maximum and second maximum elements.**
