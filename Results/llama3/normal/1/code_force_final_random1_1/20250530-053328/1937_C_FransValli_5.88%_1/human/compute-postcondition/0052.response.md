Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `res` is '<', stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still at least 3, `i` is still 2, and `res` is still '<'. The stdin still contains at least 1 fewer test case.
