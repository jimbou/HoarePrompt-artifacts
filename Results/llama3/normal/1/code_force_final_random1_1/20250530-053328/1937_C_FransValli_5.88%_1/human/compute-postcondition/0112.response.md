Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `res` is the input from stdin, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is "<" otherwise `k` is `n-2`, `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 0 test case, and this is printed: "? 0 [k] 0 [i]" where [k] is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on whether `res` is "<" or not, and [i] is `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 0, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The print statement has been executed, displaying the specified message with the values of `k` and `i` inserted. The stdin still contains at least 0 test case.
