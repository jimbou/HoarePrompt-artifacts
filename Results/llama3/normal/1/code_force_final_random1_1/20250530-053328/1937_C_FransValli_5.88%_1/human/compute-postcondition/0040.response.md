Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, `res` is a string from the input, `best` is 3, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case. If `res` equals '<', then this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` which is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 4, `i` is still 3, `k` is still an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, and `res` is still a string from the input. However, the value of `best` has been updated to 3. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by at least 1. Additionally, if `res` equals '<', then a string is printed containing '?' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best` (which is 3), the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` (which is 3).
