Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than its original value and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is a string from the input and equals '<', `k` is `n-1`, `best` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships. The stdin still contains at least 1 fewer test case.
