Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is the new input from stdin which is '<', `k` is `n-1`, `best` is 0, stdin contains at least -1 test case, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k` which is `n-1`, followed by the value of `best` which is 0, followed by the value of `k` again, and finally followed by the value of `i` which is 1**
