Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than its original value and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `res` is a string from the input, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `k` is 1, `best` is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to a new string from the input, and the values of `k` and `best` are determined based on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `k` is `n-1` and `best` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is 1 and `best` is 0. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case because one test case has been processed.
