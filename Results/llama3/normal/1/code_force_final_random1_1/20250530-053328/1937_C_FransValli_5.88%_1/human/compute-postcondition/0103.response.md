Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the input from stdin, `k` is 3, `best` is unknown, stdin contains at least 1 test case, and this is printed: "? 0 [k] 0 [i]" where [k] is 3 and [i] is 3**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The print statement still shows the same format, but with the updated value of `k`.
