Output: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `res` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case, and this is printed: ? 0 1 0 2. If `res` is '<', then `k` is 2 and nothing is printed. Otherwise, `k` is 3 and ? 0 1 0 3 is printed. The code prints the string '?' followed by the numbers 0, the value of `k` which is either 2 or 3, 0, and the value of `i` which is 4.**
