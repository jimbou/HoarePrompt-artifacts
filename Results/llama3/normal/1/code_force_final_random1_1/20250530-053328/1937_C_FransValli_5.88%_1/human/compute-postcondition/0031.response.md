The code prints a string that starts with '?' and is followed by the values of `k`, `best`, `k`, and `i`, in that order. 

`k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, and it is printed twice. 
`best` is either 1 or 0, depending on whether `res` equals '<' or not. 
`i` is 2.

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 2 (where k is an integer between 2 and n-1 inclusive, and best is either 1 or 0, depending on whether res equals '<' or not)**
