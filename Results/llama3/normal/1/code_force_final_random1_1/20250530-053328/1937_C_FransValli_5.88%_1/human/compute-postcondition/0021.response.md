Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, `res` is a string from the input, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case, and a series of ? 0 `k` 0 `i` is printed for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated from 2 to `n-1`, and the value of `k` has been updated to the last value of `i` for which the input `res` was '<'. The loop has printed a series of strings in the format ? 0 `k` 0 `i` for each iteration, and the input `res` has been read and processed for each iteration. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as `n` and stdin, remains unchanged.
