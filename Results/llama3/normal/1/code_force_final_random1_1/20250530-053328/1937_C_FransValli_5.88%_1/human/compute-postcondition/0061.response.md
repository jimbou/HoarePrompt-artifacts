To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given information and the print statement itself.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is at least 5.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `res` is a string from the input.
   - stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case.
   - If `res` is '<', then `k` is 3. Otherwise, `k` is 1.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - `print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)`

Given the initial state and the print statement, let's analyze what will be printed:

- `?` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- `0` is an integer that will be printed as is, twice because it appears twice in the print statement.
- `k` is a variable whose value depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `k` is 3; otherwise, `k` is 1. Since we don't know the exact value of `res` from the given information, we can't determine the exact value of `k` without additional context. However, based on the condition, `k` will be either 3 or 1.
- `i` is 4, as given in the initial state.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string that includes a question mark, two zeros, the value of `k` (which is either 3 or 1 based on the condition related to `res`), and the value of `i` which is 4.

Output: **? 0 [k (which is either 3 or 1 based on the condition related to res)] 0 4**
