The code prints a string that starts with '?' followed by the value of `k`, then the value of `best`, then the value of `k` again, and finally the value of `i`. 

The value of `k` is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `k` is `n-1`, otherwise `k` is `n-2`.

The value of `best` is either 1 or 0 depending on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 1, otherwise `best` is 0.

The value of `i` is 2.

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 2 (where k is either n-1 or n-2 depending on the value of res, and best is either 1 or 0 depending on the value of res)**
