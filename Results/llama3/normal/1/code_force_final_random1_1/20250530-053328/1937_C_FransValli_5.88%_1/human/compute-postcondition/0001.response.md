Output State: **n is an integer, k is 1, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains at least 1 test case, `n` becomes an integer. The second line assigns the value 1 to `k`. No other variables are affected. The value of `k` is now 1. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
