Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than its original value, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is a string from the input, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case. If `res` is '<', then `k` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `k` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `n` remains a positive integer greater than its original value, `i` is now equal to `n-1`, and `res` is still a string from the input. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by at least 1. The value of `k` depends on the last input `res`: if `res` is '<', then `k` is updated to `n-1`; otherwise, `k` remains 1.
