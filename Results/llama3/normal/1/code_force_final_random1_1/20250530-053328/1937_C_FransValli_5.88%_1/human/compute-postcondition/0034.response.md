Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, `res` is a string from the input, `best` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being at least 3, `k` still being an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, and `res` still being a string from the input. The stdin still contains at least 1 fewer test case.
