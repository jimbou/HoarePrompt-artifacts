Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. 

The program first finds the index `k` of the maximum value in the sequence `p` by comparing each element with the current maximum. This is done in `n-1` queries.

Then, it finds the index `best` of the minimum value in the sequence `p` by comparing each element with the current minimum, but only considering the elements that are not `k`. This is done in `n-1` queries.

Finally, it prints the indices `k` and `best` as the pair of indices that maximize the XOR operation.

The program uses at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit. It also handles the case where `n` is 2, in which case it simply prints the indices 0 and 1.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
