Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality of finding any two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

The program first finds the maximum element in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum. It then finds the second maximum element by comparing each element with the current maximum and the second maximum. The program uses intermediate queries to determine the maximum and second maximum elements.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly uses the bitwise OR operation to compare elements and determine the maximum and second maximum elements. The program also correctly prints the maximum and second maximum elements in the required format.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, and it correctly finds the maximum and second maximum elements in the permutation.

Correctness: **True**
