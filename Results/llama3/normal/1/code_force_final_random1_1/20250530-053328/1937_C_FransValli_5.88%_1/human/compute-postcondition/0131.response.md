Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is '?', `k` is `n-1` if `res` was '<' otherwise `k` is `n-2`, `best` is 3 if `res` was '<' otherwise `best` is 0, stdin contains at least -1 test case, and '?' followed by the value of `k` which is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `best` which is either 2 or 0 depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `k` again, and finally followed by the value of `i` which is 3 has been printed.***
