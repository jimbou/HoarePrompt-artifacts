The code prints an exclamation mark '!', followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, and then the value of `k` again, and finally the value of `i`. 

The value of `k` is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of `res`. The value of `best` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`. The value of `i` is `n`.

Since the exact value of `n` and `res` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `k`, `best`, and `i`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values.

Output: **!(exclamation mark), k (where k is either n-1 or n-2 depending on the value of res), best (where best is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of res), k (where k is either n-1 or n-2 depending on the value of res), i (where i is n)**
