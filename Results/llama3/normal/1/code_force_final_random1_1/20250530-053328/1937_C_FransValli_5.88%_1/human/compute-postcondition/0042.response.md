Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, `res` is a string from the input, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case. If `res` equals '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` has reached `n-1`. The value of `k` remains an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, and the value of `res` is still a string from the input. The value of `best` depends on the value of `res`: if `res` equals '<', then `best` is `n-1`, otherwise `best` is 0.
