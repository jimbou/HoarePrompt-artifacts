Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `res` is the new input from stdin, `k` is 3 if the new `res` is "<" otherwise `k` is 1, `best` is unknown, stdin contains at least 0 test case, and this is printed: ? 0 [k] 0 [i] where [k] is either 3 or 1 depending on whether the new `res` is "<" or not, and [i] is 4**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains at least 5, the value of `i` remains 4, the value of `res` is updated to the new input from stdin, the value of `k` is updated based on the new value of `res`, the value of `best` remains unknown, the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1, and the same string is printed with the updated value of `k`.
