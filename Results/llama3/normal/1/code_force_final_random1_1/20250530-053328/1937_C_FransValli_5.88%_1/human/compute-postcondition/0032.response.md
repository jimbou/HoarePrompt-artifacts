Output: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, `res` is a string from the input. If `res` equals '<', `best` is 1, otherwise `best` is 0. Stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case, and a series of ? 0 `k` 0 `i` is printed for each iteration of the loop, and this is printed: ? [k] [best] [k] [i], where k is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, best is 1 if `res` equals '<', otherwise best is 0, and i is 2**
