The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 3 and i is now 2. 
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case**
