Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first finds the maximum element in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum (initially set to the first element). This is done using the query "? 0 k 0 i" where k is the current maximum and i is the current element being compared. If the result is '<', it means the current element is greater than the current maximum, so k is updated to i. This process is repeated for all elements in the permutation.

2. After finding the maximum element, the program finds the second maximum element by comparing each element with the current maximum (k) and the current second maximum (best, initially set to 0). This is done using the query "? k best k i" where k is the maximum element, best is the current second maximum, and i is the current element being compared. If the result is '<', it means the current element is greater than the current second maximum, so best is updated to i. This process is repeated for all elements in the permutation except the maximum element.

3. Finally, the program prints the maximum and second maximum elements in the format "! k best".

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are also correctly formatted and the results are correctly interpreted.

Correctness: **True**
