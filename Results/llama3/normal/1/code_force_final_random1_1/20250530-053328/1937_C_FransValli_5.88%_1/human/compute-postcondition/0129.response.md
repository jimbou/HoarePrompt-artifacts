Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<' otherwise `k` is `n-2`, `best` is 2 if `res` is '<' otherwise `best` is 0, stdin contains at least -1 test case, and '?' followed by the value of `k` which is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `best` which is either 2 or 0 depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `k` again, and finally followed by the value of `i` which is 3 has been printed, and `res` is assigned the value '?'**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `best` remain the same as before. The value of `res` is updated to '?' which is the input from stdin. The stdin still contains at least -1 test case, and the values of `k`, `best`, and `i` have been printed.
