The code `res = input()` accepts a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `res`. The stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, `res` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case, and this is printed: ? 0 1 0 2**
