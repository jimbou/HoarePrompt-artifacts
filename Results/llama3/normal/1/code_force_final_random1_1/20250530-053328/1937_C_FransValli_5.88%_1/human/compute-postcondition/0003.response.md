The code prints a string containing a question mark, followed by the values of the variables `0`, `k`, `0`, and `i`, separated by spaces. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the standard output.

Here's a breakdown of the values:

* `0` is a literal integer value.
* `k` is a variable with a value of `1`, as specified in the initial state.
* `0` is another literal integer value.
* `i` is a variable with a value of `2`, as specified in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be a string containing the question mark, followed by the values `0`, `1`, `0`, and `2`, separated by spaces.

Output: **? 0 1 0 2**
