Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than its original value, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is a string from the input, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `k` is 1, `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `res`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state, as they are not affected by the code. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `best`, which is initialized to 0. The stdin still contains at least 1 fewer test case, as the code does not modify the input.
