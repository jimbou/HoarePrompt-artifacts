Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than its original value and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `res` is a string from the input, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `k` is 1, `best` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still a positive integer greater than its original value and greater than 1. The value of `i` is still 2. The value of `res` is still a string from the input. The value of `k` is still dependent on the value of `res`, being `n-1` if `res` is '<' and 1 otherwise. The stdin still contains at least 1 fewer test case.
