To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, `res` is a string from the input, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case. If `res` equals '<', then `best` is 2. Otherwise, `best` is 0.**
