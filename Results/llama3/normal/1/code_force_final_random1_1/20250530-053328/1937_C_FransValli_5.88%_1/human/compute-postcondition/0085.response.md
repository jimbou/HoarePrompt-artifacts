The code `best = i` assigns the value of `i` to `best`. The value of `i` is 3. Therefore, the value of `best` is now 3.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. `n` is still a positive integer greater than its original value and greater than 3. `res` is still a string from the input. `k` is still `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `k` is 1. stdin still contains at least 1 fewer test case.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than its original value and greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is a string from the input, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `k` is 1, `best` is 3, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case.**
