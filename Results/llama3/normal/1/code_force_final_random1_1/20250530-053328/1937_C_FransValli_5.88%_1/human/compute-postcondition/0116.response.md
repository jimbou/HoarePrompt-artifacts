Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is the new input from stdin, `k` is `n-1` if the new `res` is "<" otherwise `k` is `n-2`, `best` is 0, stdin contains at least -1 test case, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k` which is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `best` which is 0, followed by the value of `k` again, and finally followed by the value of `i` which is 1**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the new input from stdin, and the value of `k` has been updated based on the new value of `res`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `best` remain the same. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1. The printed output remains the same, with the updated values of `k` and `res`.
