Output: **`n` is a positive integer greater than its original value and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `res` is a string from the input, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `k` is 1, `best` is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k` (either `n-1` or 1), the value of `best` (either 1 or 0), the value of `k` again (either `n-1` or 1), and the value of `i` which is 2**
