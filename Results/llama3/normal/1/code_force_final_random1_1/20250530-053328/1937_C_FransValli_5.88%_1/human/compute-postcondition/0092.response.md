To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 2). Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, but we need to make sure it's at least 3 for the loop to execute. We also need to set `i` to the starting value of the range, which is 2.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, `res` is unknown, `best` is unknown, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case**
