The code assigns the value of `i` to `k`. The value of `i` is 3. Therefore, `k` is now 3.

The values of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still at least 4, `res` is still a string from the input, and stdin still contains at least 1 fewer test case. The condition that if `res` is '<', then `k` is 2, otherwise, `k` is 1 is no longer valid because `k` is now 3.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `res` is a string from the input, `k` is 3, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case.**
