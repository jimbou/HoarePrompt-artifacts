Output: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, `res` is a string from the input, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case. If `res` equals '<', then `best` is 2. Otherwise, `best` is 0, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` which is 3.**
