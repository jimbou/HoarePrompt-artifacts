To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 2 and goes up to but does not include `n`). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 3.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, `res` is a string from the input, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case**
