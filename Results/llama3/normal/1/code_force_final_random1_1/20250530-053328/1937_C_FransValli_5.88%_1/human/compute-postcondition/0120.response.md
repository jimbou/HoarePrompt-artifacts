The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<' otherwise `k` is `n-2`, `best` is 1 if `res` is '<' otherwise `best` is 0, stdin contains at least -1 test case, and '?' followed by the value of `k` which is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `best` which is either 1 or 0 depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `k` again, and finally followed by the value of `i` which is 1 has been printed.**
