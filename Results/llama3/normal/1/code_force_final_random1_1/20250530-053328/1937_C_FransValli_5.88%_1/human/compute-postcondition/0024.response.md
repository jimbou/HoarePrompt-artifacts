The code prints a string that starts with '?' and is followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i`. 

Here, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, `best` is 0, and `i` is 1.

Output: **? [k] 0 [k] 1 (where k is an integer between 2 and n-1 inclusive)**
