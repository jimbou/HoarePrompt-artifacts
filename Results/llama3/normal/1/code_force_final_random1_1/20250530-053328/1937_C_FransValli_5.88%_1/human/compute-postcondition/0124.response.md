Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<' otherwise `k` is `n-2`, `best` is 2, stdin contains at least -1 test case, and '?' followed by the value of `k` which is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `best` which is 2, followed by the value of `k` again, and finally followed by the value of `i` which is 2 has been printed.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains the same input values.
