Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n`, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<' otherwise `k` is `n-2`, `best` is `n-1` if `res` is '<' otherwise `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 0 test case, and '?' followed by the value of `k` which is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `best` which is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `k` again, and finally followed by the value of `i` which is `n` has been printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the final values of the variables are as follows:

*   `n` remains the same as the initial state.
*   `i` has reached its final value, which is `n`.
*   `res` can be either '<' or not '<', depending on the input from stdin.
*   `k` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, depending on the value of `res`.
*   `best` is either `n-1` or 0, depending on the value of `res`.
*   Stdin contains at least 0 test case.
*   The final print statement has been executed, printing '?' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and finally the value of `i`, which is `n`.
