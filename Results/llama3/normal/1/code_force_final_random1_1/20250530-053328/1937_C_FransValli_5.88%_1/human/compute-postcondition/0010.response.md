Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `?` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `0` is a literal integer that will be printed as is.
* `k` is a variable that has a value of 1, as stated in the precondition. Therefore, `k` will be printed as 1.
* `0` is another literal integer that will be printed as is.
* `i` is a variable that has a value of 3, as stated in the precondition. Therefore, `i` will be printed as 3.

Since `res` is not used in the print statement, its value does not affect the output.

Therefore, the output will be a string that combines the literal strings and values of the variables, separated by spaces.

Output: **? 0 1 0 3**
