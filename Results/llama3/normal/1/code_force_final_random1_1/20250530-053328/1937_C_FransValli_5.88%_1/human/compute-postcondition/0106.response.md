Based on the precondition, the print statement will output a string that includes the character '?', the value 0, the value of `k`, the value 0, and the value of `i`.

The value of `k` depends on the value of `res`, which is the input from stdin. If `res` is "<", then `k` is 3; otherwise, `k` is 1.

The value of `i` is given as 4.

Therefore, the output will be a string that includes the character '?', the value 0, the value of `k` (which is either 3 or 1), the value 0, and the value 4.

Output: **? 0 [k] 0 4 (where k is either 3 or 1, depending on the value of res)**
