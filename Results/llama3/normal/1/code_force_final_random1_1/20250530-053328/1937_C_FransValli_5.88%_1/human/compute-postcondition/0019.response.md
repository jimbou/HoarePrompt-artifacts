Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `res` is a string from the input, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case, `k` is 4, and either ? 0 1 0 2 or ? 0 1 0 3 is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 4, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the printed output is still either ? 0 1 0 2 or ? 0 1 0 3.
