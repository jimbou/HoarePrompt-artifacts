The code `k = i` assigns the value of `i` to `k`. Since `i` is 2, `k` is now 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `res` is "<", `best` is unknown, stdin contains at least 1 test case**
