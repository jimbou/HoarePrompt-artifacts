The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than its original value and greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is a string from the input, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `k` is 1, `best` is 2 if `res` is '<', otherwise `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case.**
