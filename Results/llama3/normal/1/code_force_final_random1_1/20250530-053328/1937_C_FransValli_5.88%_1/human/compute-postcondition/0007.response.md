Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `res` is '<', stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case, and this is printed: ? 0 1 0 2**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables, `n`, `i`, and `res`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 fewer test case, and the printed output remains the same.
