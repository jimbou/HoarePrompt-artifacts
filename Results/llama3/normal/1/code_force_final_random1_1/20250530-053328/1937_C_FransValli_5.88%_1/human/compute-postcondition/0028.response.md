Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, `res` is a string from the input and equals '<', `best` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case, and a series of ? 0 `k` 0 `i` is printed for each iteration of the loop, and this is printed: ? [k] [best] [k] [i]**.

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The program has not exited any loops or conditional statements, so the loop and conditional statements are still active. The stdin still contains at least 1 fewer test case, and the series of ? 0 `k` 0 `i` is still printed for each iteration of the loop, and this is printed: ? [k] [best] [k] [i].
