According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `res` is a string from the input, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case. If `res` is '<', then `k` is 2. Otherwise, `k` is 1.**
