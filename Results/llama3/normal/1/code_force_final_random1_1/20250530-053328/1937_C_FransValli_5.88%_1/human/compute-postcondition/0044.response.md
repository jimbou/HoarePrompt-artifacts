Output: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, `res` is a string from the input, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case. If `res` equals '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is 0., and this is printed: '!', k (where k is an integer between 2 and n-1 inclusive), best (where best is either n-1 if res equals '<' or 0 otherwise)**
