Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^4) followed by a permutation p of integers from 0 to n - 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            k = i
    best = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            best = i
    print('!', k, best, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, `res` is a string from the input, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case. If `res` equals '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is 0., and this is printed: '!', k (where k is an integer between 2 and n-1 inclusive), best (where best is either n-1 if res equals '<' or 0 otherwise)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than its original value, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is a string from the input, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `k` is 1, `best` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case, and this is printed: '!', k, best

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n`, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<' otherwise `k` is `n-2`, `best` is `n-1` if `res` is '<' otherwise `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 0 test case, and '?' followed by the value of `k` which is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `best` which is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `k` again, and finally followed by the value of `i` which is `n` has been printed, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `k` which is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `best` which is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
