Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, `res` is a string from the input, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case. If `res` equals '<', then `best` is 2. Otherwise, `best` is 0, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i` which is 3.**

The code reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `res`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin now contains at least 1 fewer test case. The conditions related to `best` and the printed values are still valid, but the value of `res` has been updated to the newly read string.
