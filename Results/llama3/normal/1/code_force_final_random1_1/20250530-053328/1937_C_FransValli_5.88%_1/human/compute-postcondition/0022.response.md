Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1` inclusive, `res` is a string from the input, `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case, and a series of ? 0 `k` 0 `i` is printed for each iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `res` remain unchanged from the initial state. The variable `best` is newly introduced and assigned the value 0. The stdin still contains at least 1 fewer test case, and the series of ? 0 `k` 0 `i` is printed for each iteration of the loop.
