Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than its original value and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is a string from the input, `k` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `k` is 1, `best` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to a new string from the input. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `best` remain the same as they were not affected by the code. The stdin now contains at least one fewer test case as one input has been consumed.
