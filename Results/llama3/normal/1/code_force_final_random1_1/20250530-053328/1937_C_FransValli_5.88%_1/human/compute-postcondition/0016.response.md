Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `res` is a string, but its value is not explicitly given. However, it is mentioned that if `res` is '<', then `k` is 2, otherwise `k` is 3. Since `res` is not explicitly '<', we can infer that `res` is not '<', and therefore `k` is 3.
* `i` is given as 4.
* The `flush=True` argument is used to ensure that the output is printed immediately, without buffering.

Considering these points, the print statement will output:

Output: **? 0 3 0 4**

This output includes the string '?' followed by the values 0, 3 (which is the value of `k`), 0, and 4 (which is the value of `i`).
