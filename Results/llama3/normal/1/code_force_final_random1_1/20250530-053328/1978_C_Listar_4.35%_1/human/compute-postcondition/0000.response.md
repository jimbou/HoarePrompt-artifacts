Output State: **`n` and `k` are returned by `func_2()`, `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_2()`. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer is still valid after the code has been executed.
