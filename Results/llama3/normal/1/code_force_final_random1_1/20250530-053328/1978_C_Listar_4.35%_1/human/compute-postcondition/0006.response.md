Output State: **n is a positive integer and not equal to 0, k is a non-negative integer, l is the value returned by func_1(n, k)**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value returned by `func_1(n, k)` to `l`. Since `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 0, and `k` is a non-negative integer, the value of `l` is determined by the return value of `func_1(n, k)`. The second line calls `func_3(l)`, but since the return value of `func_3(l)` is not assigned to any variable, it does not affect the state of the program. Therefore, the final state of the program includes the original values of `n` and `k`, and the new value of `l` returned by `func_1(n, k)`.
