Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it meets the problem description and the execution summaries of its functions are consistent with the expected behavior.

Function 1 (`func_1`) correctly rotates a list of integers from 1 to n by moving the last k elements to the beginning of the list. This is used to generate a permutation with a specific Manhattan value.

Function 2 (`func_2`) correctly filters out cases where k is odd or exceeds the calculated max_k for a given n. This is used to determine if a permutation with a specific Manhattan value is possible.

Function 3 (`func_3`) correctly prints the elements of the input list in their original order, separated by spaces, and then a new line, without modifying the list. This is used to output the permutation.

Function 4 (`func_4`) correctly calls the other functions in the correct order to solve the problem. It first calls `func_2` to determine if a permutation with a specific Manhattan value is possible. If it is, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to output the permutation. If it is not, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs and outputs the correct results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
