Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 5 and k = 12, the program outputs "Yes" and the permutation [5, 4, 3, 1, 2], but the Manhattan value of this permutation is 6, not 12. This is because the program does not correctly calculate the Manhattan value of the permutation.

The issue lies in the function func_1, where the program tries to construct a permutation with a Manhattan value equal to k. However, the program does not correctly calculate the Manhattan value of the permutation, and it does not check if the constructed permutation actually has a Manhattan value equal to k.

To fix this issue, the program should correctly calculate the Manhattan value of the permutation and check if it is equal to k. If not, the program should output "No".
