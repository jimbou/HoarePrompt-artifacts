The code prints the next integer in the list, which is the value of `i`.
Since `i` is the next integer in the list and the list contains distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, the value of `i` will be one of the integers from 1 to n.
Output: **the next integer in the list (which is one of the integers from 1 to n)**
