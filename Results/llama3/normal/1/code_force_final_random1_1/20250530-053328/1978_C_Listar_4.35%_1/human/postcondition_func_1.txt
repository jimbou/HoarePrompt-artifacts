This function takes two non-negative integers `n` and `k` as input, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`. It checks if `k` is even, and if so, it calculates a maximum value `max_k` based on `n`. If `k` is greater than `max_k`, the function returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is odd, the function immediately returns `(0, 0)`. The function effectively filters out cases where `k` is odd or exceeds the calculated `max_k` for a given `n`, and returns the original values only when `k` is even and within the valid range.
