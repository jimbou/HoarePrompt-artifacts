Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`, which represent the final destination, the number of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries, respectively.
3. It then reads the `k` integers representing the points `a_i` and the `k` integers representing the times `b_i`.
4. The program calculates the differences between consecutive elements in the `a` and `b` arrays, which represent the distances and times between consecutive points, respectively.
5. It then calculates the speeds `v` between consecutive points by dividing the distance differences by the time differences.
6. For each query, it uses binary search to find the index `s` of the point `a_s` that is closest to the query point `ql`.
7. If the query point is exactly at a known point, it prints the corresponding time `b_s`.
8. Otherwise, it calculates the interpolated time by adding the time `b_s-1` to the product of the speed `v_s` and the distance `ql - a_s-1`.
9. The program prints the interpolated time for each query, separated by spaces, and then prints a newline character to separate the output for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
