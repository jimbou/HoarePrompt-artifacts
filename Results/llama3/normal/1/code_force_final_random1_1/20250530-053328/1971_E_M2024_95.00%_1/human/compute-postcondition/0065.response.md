Output State: **n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing 1 integer which is 0, stdin contains no test cases, i is k, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], ql is an integer, m is a non-negative integer, s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is q-1, q is 0, and nothing is being printed, _ is 1, t is at least 0**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the state of the variables has been updated accordingly. The list `ad` now contains `k+1` integers, where the first integer is 0, and the remaining integers are the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a`. The variable `i` has reached the value `k`, indicating that the loop has iterated `k` times. The list `v` still contains `k+1` elements, but now the remaining elements are the divisions of the corresponding elements in `ad` by the single element in `bd`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
