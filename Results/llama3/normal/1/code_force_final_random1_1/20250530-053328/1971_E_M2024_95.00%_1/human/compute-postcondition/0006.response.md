Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing three integers where the first integer is `a[1] - a[0]`, the second integer is `a[1] - a[0]`, and the third integer is `a[2] - a[1]`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still at least 1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `q` are still non-negative integers within the given ranges. The list `a` still contains at least 3 integers. The list `b` still contains k+1 integers. The list `ad` now contains three integers: the first two are the difference between the first two elements of `a`, and the third is the difference between the second and third elements of `a`. The list `bd` remains unchanged with a single integer 0. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by one. The value of `i` is still 2.
