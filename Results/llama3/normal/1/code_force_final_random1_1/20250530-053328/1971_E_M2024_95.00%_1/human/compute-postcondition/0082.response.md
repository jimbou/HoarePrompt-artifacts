Output State: **n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], i is 1, ql is an integer, m is 0, s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is 0, q is at least 0, nothing is being printed, _ is 1, t is at least 0, and v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `l`, `_`, and `t` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is set to 0, `i` is set to 1, and `ql` is set to an integer value read from the input. The value of `s` is set to the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, which is determined by the `bisect_left` function. The value of `v` remains unchanged.
