To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of list `b`. Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, since the loop condition depends on the length of `b`, for the loop to execute again, `b` must have at least one more element than it currently does.

Given that `b` is a list of at least 3 integers, for the loop to execute again, `b` must have at least 4 integers.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 4 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing three integers where the second integer is the difference between the second and first elements in `b` and the third integer is the difference between the third and second elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 3**
