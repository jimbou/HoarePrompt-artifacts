Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1]`, `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are `b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1]`, `i` is `k`, `ql` is an integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `s` is an integer representing the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `l` is `q-1`, `q` is 0, nothing is being printed, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 0, and `v` is a list containing only one element which is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `i`, `ql`, `m`, `s`, `l`, `q`, `_`, and `t` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `v` is now a list containing only one element, which is 0.
