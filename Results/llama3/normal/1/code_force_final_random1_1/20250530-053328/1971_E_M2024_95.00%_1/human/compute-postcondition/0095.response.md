Output State: **n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], i is 1, ql is an integer equal to the first input, s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is 1, q is at least 0, nothing is being printed, _ is 1, t is at least 0, and v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], and the integer value of 0 is being printed, and b[s] is printed, where b[s] is the s-th element of the list b, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables. The only effect of the "continue" statement is to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration of the loop.
