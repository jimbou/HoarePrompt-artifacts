Output State: **t is at least 1, n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of k+1 integers, b is a list of k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is 1, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], q is greater than 0, l is 0, m is 0, ql is an integer, s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and the current value of a[s] is equal to ql, and the value of b[s] is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same, and we simply move to the next iteration of the loop.
