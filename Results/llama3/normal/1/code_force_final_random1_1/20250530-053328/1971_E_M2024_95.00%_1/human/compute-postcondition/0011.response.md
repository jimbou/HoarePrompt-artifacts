Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing two integers where the second integer is the difference between the second and first elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `bd` has been updated to include the difference between the second and first elements in `b`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
