Output State: **n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of at least 3 integers, b is a list of k+1 integers, ad is a list containing 5 integers: the first integer is 0, the second integer is a[1] - a[0], the third integer is a[2] - a[1], the fourth integer is a[i] - a[i - 1], and the fifth integer is a[i] - a[i - 1], bd is a list containing 1 integer which is 0, stdin contains no test cases, i is 3, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], ad[k+1] / bd[k+1], ql is an integer, m is a non-negative integer, s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is q-1, q is 0, and nothing is being printed, _ is 1, t is at least 0**

In this output state, the value of ad has been updated by appending a new element which is the difference between the current element and the previous element in list a. The other variables remain unchanged.
