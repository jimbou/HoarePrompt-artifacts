Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is k
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing two integers where the second integer is the difference between the second and first elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 3 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing three integers where the second integer is the difference between the second and first elements in `b` and the third integer is the difference between the third and second elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 4 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing four integers where the second integer is the difference between the second and first elements in `b`, the third integer is the difference between the third and second elements in `b`, and the fourth integer is the difference between the fourth and third elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
