Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least len(b) integers, `ad` is a list containing len(a) integers: 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], `bd` is a list containing len(b) integers: 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], `i` is len(a) - 1, `ql` is an integer equal to the first input minus a[s - 1], `s` is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, `l` is q-1, `q` is 0, nothing is being printed, `_` is 2, `t` is at least 1, `v` is a list containing len(a) elements: 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], `m` is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], stdin contains no inputs

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the variable `i` has reached the last index of the list `a`. The list `v` now contains the division results of corresponding elements from lists `ad` and `bd`, starting from the second element of `ad` and `bd` (index 1) up to the last element of `ad` and `bd` (index len(a) - 1). The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values or states.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer and must be greater than 0, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least len(b) integers, ad is a list containing len(a) integers: 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing len(b) integers: 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], i is 1, ql is an integer equal to the first input, s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is 0, q is 0, nothing is being printed, _ is 2, t is at least 1, v is a list containing len(a) elements: 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], m is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], stdin contains no inputs, and the value of m which is equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s] is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer and must be greater than 1, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least len(b) integers, ad is a list containing len(a) integers: 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing len(b) integers: 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], i is 1, ql is an integer equal to the first input minus a[s - 1], s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is 1, q is 0, nothing is being printed, _ is 2, t is at least 1, v is a list containing len(a) elements: 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], m is m plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], stdin contains no inputs. If a[s] equals ql, then the value of b at index s which is b[s] is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop, and the integer value of m is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer and must be greater than 0, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least len(b) integers, ad is a list containing len(a) integers: 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing len(b) integers: 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], i is 1, ql is an integer equal to the first input minus a[s - 1] minus a[s - 1], s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is 2, q is 1, nothing is being printed, _ is 2, t is at least 1, v is a list containing len(a) elements: 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], m is m plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s] plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], and the integer value of m is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
