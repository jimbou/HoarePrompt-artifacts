Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 3, `v` is a list containing four elements: the first element is 0, the second element is `ad[1] / bd[1]`, the third element is `ad[2] / bd[2]`, and the fourth element is `ad[3] / bd[3]`.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated by appending the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list, where `i` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
