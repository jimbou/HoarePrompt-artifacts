The only variable in the loop head is variable `l`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and `q`. If `l` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 0, `q` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `l` must be 1 and `q` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `q` <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `k+1` integers, `b` is a list of `k+1` integers, `ad` is a list containing `k+1` integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing `k+1` integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `i` is 1, `v` is a list containing `k+1` elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[k] / bd[k]`, `q` is greater than 1, `l` is 1, `m` is `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is an integer representing the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, and if the current value of `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the value of `b[s]` is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop, and the value of `m` which is `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]` is printed**
