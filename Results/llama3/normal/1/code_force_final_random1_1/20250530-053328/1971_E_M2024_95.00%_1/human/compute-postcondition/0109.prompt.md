Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1]`, `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are `b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1]`, `i` is `k+1`, `ql` is an integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `s` is an integer representing the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `l` is `q-1`, `q` is 0, nothing is being printed, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 0, and `v` is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are `ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k]`.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], i is 1, ql is an integer, m is a value that is the sum of its original value, b[s - 1], and the product of bd[s] and ql / ad[s], s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is 0, q is at least 0, nothing is being printed, _ is 1, t is at least 0, and v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], and the integer value of m is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a non-negative integer, k is a non-negative integer, q is a non-negative integer, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], i is 1, ql is an integer equal to the first input minus a[s - 1], s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is 1, q is at least 0, nothing is being printed, _ is 1, t is at least 0, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], and the integer value of 0 is being printed, m is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], and the integer value of m is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a non-negative integer, k is a non-negative integer, q is at least 1, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], i is 1, ql is an integer equal to the first input minus a[s - 1], s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is 2, q is at least 1, nothing is being printed, _ is 1, t is at least 0, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], m is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], the integer value of 0 is being printed. If a[s] equals ql, then b[s] is being printed and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration, and the integer value of m is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
