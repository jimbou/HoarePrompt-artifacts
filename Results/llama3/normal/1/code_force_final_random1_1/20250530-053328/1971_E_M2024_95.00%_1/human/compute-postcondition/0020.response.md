Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 1, `v` is a list containing two elements: the first element is 0 and the second element is `ad[1] / bd[1]`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1. The list `v` now contains two elements: the first element is 0 (which was already present), and the second element is the result of the division `ad[1] / bd[1]`, which is a new value added to the list.
