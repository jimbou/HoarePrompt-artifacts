Output State: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least len(b) integers, `ad` is a list containing len(a) integers: 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], `bd` is a list containing len(b) integers: 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], `i` is len(a) - 1, `ql` is an integer equal to the first input minus a[s - 1], `s` is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, `l` is q-1, `q` is 0, nothing is being printed, `_` is 2, `t` is at least 1, `v` is a list containing len(a) elements: 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], `m` is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], stdin contains no inputs

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached the end of the list `a`, and the list `v` has been populated with the ratios of the corresponding elements in `ad` and `bd`. The other variables remain unchanged.
