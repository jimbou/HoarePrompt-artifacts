Output State: **t is at least 1, n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of k+1 integers, b is a list of k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, i is 1, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], q is greater than 0, l is 1, m is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s], ql is ql - a[s - 1], s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and if the current value of a[s] is equal to ql, the value of b[s] is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop, and the value of m which is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s] is printed, and b[s] is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the continue statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program flow continues to the next iteration.
