Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least 4 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing four integers where the first integer is `a[1] - a[0]`, the second integer is `a[1] - a[0]`, the third integer is `a[2] - a[1]`, and the fourth integer is `a[3] - a[2]`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `ad` has been updated by appending the difference between the fourth and third elements of list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
