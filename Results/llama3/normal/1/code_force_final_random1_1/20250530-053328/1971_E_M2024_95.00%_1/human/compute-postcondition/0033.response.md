Output State: **t is at least 1, n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of k+1 integers, b is a list of k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is 1, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], q is greater than 0, l is 0, m is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s], ql is ql - a[s - 1], s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and if the current value of a[s] is equal to ql, the value of b[s] is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `m` and `ql` have been updated based on the given code. The value of `m` is now the sum of its original value, `b[s - 1]`, and the product of `bd[s]`, `ql`, and the division of `bd[s]` by `ad[s]`. The value of `ql` is now the difference between its original value and `a[s - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
