Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 3 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1]`, `bd` is a list containing 2 integers: the first integer is 0 and the second integer is `b[1] - b[0]`, `stdin` contains no test cases, `i` is 1, `v` is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are `ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k]`, `ql` is an integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `s` is an integer representing the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `l` is `q-1`, `q` is 0, and nothing is being printed, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 0**

In this output state, the value of `bd` has been updated to include a new element, which is the difference between the second element of `b` and the first element of `b`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
