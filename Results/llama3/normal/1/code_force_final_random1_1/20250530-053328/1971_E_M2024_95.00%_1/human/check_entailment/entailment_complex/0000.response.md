Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of four lines: the first line contains three integers n, k, and q, the second and third lines contain k integers each, and the fourth line contains q integers.

2. The program correctly calculates the differences between consecutive elements in the second and third lines of input, which represent the distances and times between consecutive points on the number line.

3. The program correctly uses these differences to interpolate the corresponding values in the fourth line of input, which represent the queries for the time it takes the car to reach certain points on the number line.

4. The program correctly prints the interpolated values for each test case, separated by spaces, and then prints a newline character to separate the output for each test case.

5. The program correctly handles the case where the query point is exactly at one of the known points on the number line, in which case it simply prints the known time.

6. The program correctly handles the case where the query point is between two known points on the number line, in which case it interpolates the time based on the distances and times between the two known points.

7. The program correctly handles the case where the query point is beyond the last known point on the number line, in which case it extrapolates the time based on the distance and time between the last two known points.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
