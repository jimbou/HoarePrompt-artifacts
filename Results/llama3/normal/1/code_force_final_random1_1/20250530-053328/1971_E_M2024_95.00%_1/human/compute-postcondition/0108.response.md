Output: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a non-negative integer, q is at least 1, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], i is 1, ql is an integer equal to the first input minus a[s - 1], s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is 2, q is at least 1, nothing is being printed, _ is 1, t is at least 0, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], m is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], the integer value of 0 is being printed. If a[s] equals ql, then b[s] is being printed and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration, and the integer value of m is being printed**
