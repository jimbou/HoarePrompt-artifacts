Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is k**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `ad` will contain the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a`, and the loop counter `i` will be equal to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
