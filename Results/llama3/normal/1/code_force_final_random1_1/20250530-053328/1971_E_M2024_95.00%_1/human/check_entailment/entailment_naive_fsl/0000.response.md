Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the problem description. It first calculates the distances and times between each pair of consecutive signs, then for each query, it finds the interval that the query point falls into and calculates the time it takes to reach that point.

The program uses binary search to find the interval that the query point falls into, which is efficient. It also correctly handles the case where the query point is exactly at a sign.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all the examples provided and seems to be correct for all possible inputs.
