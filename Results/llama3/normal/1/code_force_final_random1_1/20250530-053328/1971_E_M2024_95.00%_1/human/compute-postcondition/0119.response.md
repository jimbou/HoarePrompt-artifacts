Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 4 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing 4 integers: 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], and a[3] - a[2], `bd` is a list containing 1 integer: 0, `i` is 3, `ql` is an integer equal to the first input minus a[s - 1], `s` is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, `l` is q-1, `q` is 0, nothing is being printed, `_` is 2, `t` is at least 1, `v` is a list containing 1 element: 0, `m` is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], stdin contains no inputs**

In this output state, the list `ad` has been updated to include the difference between the third and second elements of list `a`, which is `a[3] - a[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
