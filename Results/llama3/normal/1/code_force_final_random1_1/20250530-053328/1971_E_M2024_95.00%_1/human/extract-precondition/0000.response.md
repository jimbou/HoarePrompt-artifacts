Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, k, and q. The second and third lines contain k integers. The fourth line contains q integers. n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5. The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.**
