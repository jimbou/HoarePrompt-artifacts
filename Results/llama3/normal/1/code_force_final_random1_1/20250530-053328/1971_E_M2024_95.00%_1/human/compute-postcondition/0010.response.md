To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`. The loop will execute if `b` has at least 2 elements, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(b)`. 

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 1**
