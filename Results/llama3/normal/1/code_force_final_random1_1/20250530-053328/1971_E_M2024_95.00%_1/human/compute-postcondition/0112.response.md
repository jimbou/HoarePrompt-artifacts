To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since `_` is the loop variable, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `_` will be 2.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], `i` is 1, `ql` is an integer equal to the first input minus a[s - 1], `s` is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, `l` is q-1, `q` is 0, nothing is being printed, `_` is 2, `t` is at least 1, `v` is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], `m` is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], and nothing is printed**
