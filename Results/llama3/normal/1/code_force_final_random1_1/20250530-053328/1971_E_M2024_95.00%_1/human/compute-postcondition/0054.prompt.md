Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is k, `v` is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[k] / bd[k]`.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of k+1 integers, b is a list of k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, i is 1, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], q is greater than 0, l is 0, m is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s], ql is ql - a[s - 1], s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and if the current value of a[s] is equal to ql, the value of b[s] is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop, and the value of m which is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s] is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 1, n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of k+1 integers, b is a list of k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, i is 1, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], ql is ql - a[s - 1], m is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s], s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order. If the current value of a[s] is equal to ql, the value of b[s] is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop, and the value of m which is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] is printed, and the value of m which is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 1, n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of k+1 integers, b is a list of k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, i is 1, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], ql is an integer, m is a non-negative integer, s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is 2, q is at least 1, and the integer value of m is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
