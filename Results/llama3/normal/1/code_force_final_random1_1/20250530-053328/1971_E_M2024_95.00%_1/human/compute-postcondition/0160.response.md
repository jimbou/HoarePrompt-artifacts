Output: **n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer and must be greater than 0, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least len(b) integers, ad is a list containing len(a) integers: 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing len(b) integers: 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], i is 1, ql is an integer equal to the first input minus a[s - 1], s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is 2, q is 1, nothing is being printed, _ is 2, t is at least 1, v is a list containing len(a) elements: 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], m is m plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], stdin contains no inputs. If a[s] equals ql, then the value of b at index s which is b[s] is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop, and the integer value of m is being printed, and b[s] is printed**
