Output State: **n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], i is 1, ql is an integer, m is 0, s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is 0, q is at least 0, nothing is being printed, _ is 1, t is at least 0, and v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k]. The current value of a[s] is equal to ql, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. All variables maintain their original values and properties.
