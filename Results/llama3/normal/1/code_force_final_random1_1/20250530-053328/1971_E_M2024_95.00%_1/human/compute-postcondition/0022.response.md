Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 2, `v` is a list containing three elements: the first element is 0, the second element is `ad[1] / bd[1]`, and the third element is `ad[2] / bd[2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `v` now contains three elements: the first element is 0, the second element is the ratio of the difference between the first two elements of `a` and the difference between the first two elements of `b`, and the third element is the ratio of the difference between the second and third elements of `a` and the difference between the second and third elements of `b`.
