To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and `t` in the loop head.


At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than `t`. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to increment `_` by 1 and decrement `t` by 1.


State: **`t` is at least 0, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains no test cases, `i` is 1, `v` is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[k] / bd[k]`, `ql` is an integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `s` is an integer representing the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `l` is q-1, `q` is 0, and nothing is being printed, `_` is 1**
