To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `l` and `q` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `q` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `q` to be greater than 0 and `l` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.


State: **`t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is k, `v` is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[k] / bd[k]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0**
