Output State: `t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is k

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `bd` will contain the differences between consecutive elements in list `b`, similar to how list `ad` contains the differences between consecutive elements in list `a`. The loop will have iterated `k` times, where `k` is the number of elements in list `b` minus one. The other variables remain unchanged.
