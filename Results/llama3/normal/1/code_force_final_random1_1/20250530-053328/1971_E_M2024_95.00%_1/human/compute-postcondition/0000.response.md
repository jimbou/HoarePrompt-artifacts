Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, k, and q. The second and third lines contain k integers. The fourth line contains q integers. n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5. The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.**

In natural language, the output state is that `t` is now a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The rest of the input remains the same, with each test case containing four lines of input: the first line with three integers n, k, and q, the second and third lines with k integers, and the fourth line with q integers. The constraints on n, k, and q are still valid, and the sum of k and q over all test cases is still bounded.
