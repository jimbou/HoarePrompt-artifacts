To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `a`. Since `i` is currently 1 and `a` has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The length of `a` remains the same, so `a` still has at least 2 integers.

The other variables in the state, such as `n`, `k`, `q`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `ql`, `m`, `s`, `l`, `_`, `t`, and `v`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are `a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1]`, `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are `b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1]`, `i` is 2, `ql` is an integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `s` is an integer representing the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `l` is `q-1`, `q` is 0, nothing is being printed, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 0, and `v` is a list containing two elements: the first element is 0 and the second element is `ad[1] / bd[1]`.**
