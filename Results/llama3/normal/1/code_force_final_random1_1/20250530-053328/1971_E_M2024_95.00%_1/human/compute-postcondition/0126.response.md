Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 4 integers, `ad` is a list containing len(a) integers: 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], `bd` is a list containing 4 integers: 0, b[1] - b[0], b[3] - b[2], b[3] - b[2], `i` is 3, `ql` is an integer equal to the first input minus a[s - 1], `s` is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, `l` is q-1, `q` is 0, nothing is being printed, `_` is 2, `t` is at least 1, `v` is a list containing 1 element: 0, `m` is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], stdin contains no inputs**

The code appends a new element to the list `bd`, which is the difference between the current element `b[i]` and the previous element `b[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 3, the new element appended to `bd` is `b[3] - b[2]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
