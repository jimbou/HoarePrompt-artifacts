Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is k, `v` is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[k] / bd[k]`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that the loop counter `i` has reached the value of `k`, and the list `v` has been populated with the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, starting from the first difference up to the `k`-th difference. The other variables remain unchanged.
