Output: **t is at least 1, n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of k+1 integers, b is a list of k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, i is 1, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], ql is ql - a[s - 1], m is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s], s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order. If the current value of a[s] is equal to ql, the value of b[s] is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop, and the value of m which is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] is printed, and the value of m which is m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] is printed**
