Output State: **n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], stdin contains no test cases, i is k, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], ql is an integer, m is a non-negative integer, s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is q-1, q is 0, and nothing is being printed, _ is 1, t is at least 0**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The values of `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged, with `n` and `k` being non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, and `q` being a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5.
- The list `a` remains unchanged, containing at least `k+1` integers.
- The list `b` is modified to contain at least `k+1` integers.
- The list `ad` remains unchanged, containing `k+1` integers, where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.
- The list `bd` is modified to contain `k+1` integers, where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are the differences between consecutive elements in `b`.
- The value of `i` is updated to `k`.
- The list `v` remains unchanged, containing `k+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the ratios of the corresponding elements in `ad` and `bd`.
- The values of `ql`, `m`, `s`, `l`, `q`, `_`, and `t` remain unchanged.

In summary, the loop modifies the list `b` and the list `bd`, and updates the value of `i`, while leaving the other variables unchanged.
