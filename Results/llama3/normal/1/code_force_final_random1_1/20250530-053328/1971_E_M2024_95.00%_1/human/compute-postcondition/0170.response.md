Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four lines of input. It processes each test case by calculating the differences between consecutive elements in the second and third lines of input, and then uses these differences to interpolate the corresponding values in the fourth line of input. The function prints the interpolated values for each test case, separated by spaces, and then prints a newline character to separate the output for each test case.**
