Output State: `t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is k

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is characterized by the following changes:

*   The loop variable `i` has reached its final value, which is `k`.
*   The list `bd` has been populated with `k+1` integers, where each integer represents the difference between consecutive elements in the list `b`.
*   The list `b` has at least `k+1` integers.

All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial state.
