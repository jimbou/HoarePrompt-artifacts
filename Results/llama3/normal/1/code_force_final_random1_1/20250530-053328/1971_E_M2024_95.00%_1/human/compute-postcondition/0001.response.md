According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, to make the loop execute, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, k, and q. The second and third lines contain k integers. The fourth line contains q integers. n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5. The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.**
