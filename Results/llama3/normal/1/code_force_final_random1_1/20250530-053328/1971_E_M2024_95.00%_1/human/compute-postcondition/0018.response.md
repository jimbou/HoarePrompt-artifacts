Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is k, `v` is a list containing one element which is 0**

In natural language, the output state after the code executes is that a new list `v` is created with a single element, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state. The list `v` is added to the output state with its specific value.
