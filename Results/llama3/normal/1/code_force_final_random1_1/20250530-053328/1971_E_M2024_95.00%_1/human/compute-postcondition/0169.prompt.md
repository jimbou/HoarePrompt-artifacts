Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, k, and q. The second and third lines contain k integers. The fourth line contains q integers. n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5. The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
        print(int(m), end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of k+1 integers, b is a list of k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in b, stdin contains no test cases, i is 1, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], ql is an integer, m is a non-negative integer, s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is q-1, q is 0, and nothing is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a non-negative integer, k is a non-negative integer, q is 0, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers: the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], i is 1, ql is an integer equal to the first input minus a[s - 1], s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is q-1, q is 0, nothing is being printed, _ is 1, t is at least 0, v is a list containing k+1 elements: the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], m is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], and nothing is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer and must be equal to 0, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least len(b) integers, ad is a list containing len(a) integers: 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing len(b) integers: 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], i is len(a) - 1, ql is an integer equal to the first input minus a[s - 1] minus a[s - 1] minus a[s - 1] ... minus a[s - 1] (q times), s is an integer representing the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is q-1, q is 0, nothing is being printed, _ is 2, t is at least 1, v is a list containing len(a) elements: 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 1] / bd[len(a) - 1], m is m plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s] plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s] plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s] ... plus b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s] (q times), and nothing is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
