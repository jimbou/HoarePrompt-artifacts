Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `q` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 4 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers where each integer is the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list containing four integers where the second integer is the difference between the second and first elements in `b`, the third integer is the difference between the third and second elements in `b`, and the fourth integer is the difference between the fourth and third elements in `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `bd` has been updated to include the difference between the fourth and third elements in `b`, which is `b[3] - b[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
