#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 1, edges is a list of pairs of integers between 1 and n (inclusive), start is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive). The tree represented by edges is a tree with exactly two leaves.
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer greater than 1, edges is an empty list, start is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), tree is a dictionary where each key is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive) and each value is a list of integers between 1 and n (inclusive) that are connected to the key in the graph.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game based on the parity of the distances from a given start node to the two leaves of a tree represented by a list of edges. It returns 'Ron' if either distance is odd, and 'Hermione' otherwise.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, and all nodes are non-negative integers.
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The loop terminates when the queue is empty, and the final state includes the start and target nodes, the tree, an empty queue, and a visited set containing all nodes that were visited during the loop's execution. If the target node was found, the function returns the distance of the target node from the start node; otherwise, it returns None.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found during the loop's execution.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) in a tree to find the distance between a start node and a target node. It accepts a start node, a target node, and a tree represented as a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes. The function returns the distance of the target node from the start node if found, otherwise it returns -1. The function also keeps track of visited nodes during the search.
