The code removes the leftmost element from the queue, which is a tuple containing a node and its distance, and assigns the node to the variable `current` and the distance to the variable `dist`. Since the queue is non-empty, this operation is valid.

Output State: **start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, queue is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their distances with one less element, visited is a set containing the start node, current is the node that was previously the leftmost element in the queue, and dist is the distance of the current node from the start node, which is greater than 0. The current node is not equal to the target node.**
