Output State: **The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found during the loop's execution.**

In this output state, the value -1 is returned, which signifies that the target node was not found during the loop's execution. This is in contrast to the initial state, where the function would return the distance of the target node from the start node if it was found. The return of -1 implies that the loop terminated without finding the target node, and the function is indicating this outcome.
