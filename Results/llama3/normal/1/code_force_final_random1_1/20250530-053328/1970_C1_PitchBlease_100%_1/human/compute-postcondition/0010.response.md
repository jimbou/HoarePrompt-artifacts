The only variable in the loop head is variable queue, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable queue.  If queue is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the program returns the distance of the current node from the start node if the current node is equal to the target node. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning any value. So for the loop to be executed one more time the queue must not be empty.
State: **The program returns the distance of the current node from the start node if the current node is equal to the target node. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning any value and the queue is not empty.**
