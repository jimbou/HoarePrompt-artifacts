The only variable in the loop head is variable queue, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable queue. If queue is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, queue is a deque containing a tuple of the start node and 0. This ensures that the loop will execute, so no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, queue is a deque containing a tuple of the start node and 0, and visited is a set containing the start node.**
