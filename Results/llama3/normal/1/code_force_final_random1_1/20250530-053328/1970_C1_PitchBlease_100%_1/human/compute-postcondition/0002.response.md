The code removes the leftmost element from the queue and assigns it to the variables current and dist. The queue initially contains a tuple of the start node and 0. Therefore, the value of current is the start node and the value of dist is 0.

Output State: **start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, queue is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their distances, visited is a set containing the start node, current is the start node, and dist is 0.**
