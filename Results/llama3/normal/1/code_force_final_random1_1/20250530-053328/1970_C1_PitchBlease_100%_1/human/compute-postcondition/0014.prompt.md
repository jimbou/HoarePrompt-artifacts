Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, queue is a deque containing a tuple of the start node and 0, and visited is a set containing the start node.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, queue is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their distances, visited is a set containing the start node, current is the start node, and dist is 0. The current node is not equal to the target node.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The program returns the distance of the current node from the start node if the current node is equal to the target node. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning any value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *The program returns the distance of the current node from the start node, which is the value stored in the variable 'dist', if the current node is equal to the target node. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning any value and the queue has one less element.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
