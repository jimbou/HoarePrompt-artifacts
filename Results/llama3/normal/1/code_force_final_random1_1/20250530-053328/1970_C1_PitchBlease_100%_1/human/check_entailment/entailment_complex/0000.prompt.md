Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Annotated Functions:
from collections import deque, defaultdict

(n, t) = map(int, input().split())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
starts = list(map(int, input().split()))
start = starts[0]
print(func_1(n, edges, start))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 1, edges is a list of pairs of integers between 1 and n (inclusive), start is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive). The tree represented by edges is a tree with exactly two leaves.
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer greater than 1, edges is an empty list, start is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive), tree is a dictionary where each key is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive) and each value is a list of integers between 1 and n (inclusive) that are connected to the key in the graph.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game based on the parity of the distances from a given start node to the two leaves of a tree represented by a list of edges. It returns 'Ron' if either distance is odd, and 'Hermione' otherwise.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, and all nodes are non-negative integers.
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The loop terminates when the queue is empty, and the final state includes the start and target nodes, the tree, an empty queue, and a visited set containing all nodes that were visited during the loop's execution. If the target node was found, the function returns the distance of the target node from the start node; otherwise, it returns None.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found during the loop's execution.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) in a tree to find the distance between a start node and a target node. It accepts a start node, a target node, and a tree represented as a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes. The function returns the distance of the target node from the start node if found, otherwise it returns -1. The function also keeps track of visited nodes during the search.
