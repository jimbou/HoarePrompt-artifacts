Output State: **The program returns the distance of the current node from the start node if the current node is equal to the target node. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning any value and the queue is not empty but has one less element.**

In this output state, the value of `current` is assigned the value of the first element of the queue, and the value of `dist` is assigned the value of the second element of the queue. The queue has one less element because `popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the queue. The program still returns the distance of the current node from the start node if the current node is equal to the target node, and continues execution without returning any value otherwise.
