Output State: **The loop terminates when the queue is empty, and the final state includes the start and target nodes, the tree, an empty queue, and a visited set containing all nodes that were visited during the loop's execution. If the target node was found, the function returns the distance of the target node from the start node; otherwise, it returns None.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

*   The loop terminates when the queue is empty.
*   The start and target nodes remain unchanged.
*   The tree remains unchanged.
*   The queue is empty.
*   The visited set contains all nodes that were visited during the loop's execution.
*   If the target node was found during the loop's execution, the function returns the distance of the target node from the start node. Otherwise, it returns None.
