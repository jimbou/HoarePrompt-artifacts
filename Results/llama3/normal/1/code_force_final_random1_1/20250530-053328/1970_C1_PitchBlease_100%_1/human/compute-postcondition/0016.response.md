Functionality: **This function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) in a tree to find the distance between a start node and a target node. It accepts a start node, a target node, and a tree represented as a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes. The function returns the distance of the target node from the start node if found, otherwise it returns -1. The function also keeps track of visited nodes during the search.**
