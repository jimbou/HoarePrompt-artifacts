Postcondition: **`stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 1, q is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is greater than 0, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`.**
