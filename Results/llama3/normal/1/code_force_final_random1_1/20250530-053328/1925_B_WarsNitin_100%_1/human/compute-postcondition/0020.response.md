Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 0, `i` is 3, `sqrt(x)` is greater than 3, `x` is greater than 9, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and `x // 3`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by 3. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `x`, `n`, `q`, `i`, and `sqrt(x)` are still valid. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input.
