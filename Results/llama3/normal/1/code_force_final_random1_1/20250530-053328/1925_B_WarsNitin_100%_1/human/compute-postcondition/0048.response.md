Postcondition: ***`x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 3, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` is divisible by 3, then `ans` is either 3 or its previous value if it was already greater than 3 if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`. Otherwise, `ans` is either its previous value or `x // i` if `x // i` is greater than the previous value of `ans`.***
