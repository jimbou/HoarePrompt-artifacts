Output State: **`x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, the current value of `x` minus `n` times the integer division of `x` by `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the integer division of `x` by `i` is greater than 0, and the remainder of the division of `x` minus `n` times the integer division of `x` by `i` by the integer division of `x` by `i` is 0. `ans` is either its previous value or `x // i`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `ans` is now either its previous value or the integer division of `x` by `i`. The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`.
