The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is less than the value returned by int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is 1. So for the loop to execute again q must be 2 and the value returned by int(input()) must be greater than 2. Also, stdin must contain t-4 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x).
State: **`x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 2, `i` is `sqrt(x)`, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). `ans` is the maximum of 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions: (`x` - `n` * `i` >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * `i`) % `i` == 0) or (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`) >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`)) % (`x` // `i`) == 0), and ans is printed**
