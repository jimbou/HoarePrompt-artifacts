Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x).
Code of the loop:
for q in range(int(input())):
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x
                 // i) == 0:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 0, `i` is `sqrt(x)`, `sqrt(x)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). `ans` is the maximum of 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions: (`x` - `n` * `i` >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * `i`) % `i` == 0) or (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`) >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`)) % (`x` // `i`) == 0), and the value of `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is `sqrt(x)`, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). `ans` is the maximum of 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions: (`x` - `n` * `i` >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * `i`) % `i` == 0) or (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`) >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`)) % (`x` // `i`) == 0), and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 2, `i` is `sqrt(x)`, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). `ans` is the maximum value between 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and for which `x - n * divisor` is greater than or equal to 0 and divisible by the divisor, and the maximum value between 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and for which `x - n * divisor` is greater than or equal to 0 and divisible by the divisor is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
