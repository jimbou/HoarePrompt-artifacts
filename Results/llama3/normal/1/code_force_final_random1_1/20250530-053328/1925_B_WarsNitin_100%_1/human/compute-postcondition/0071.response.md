Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 2, `i` is 3, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), then `ans` is either the previous value of `ans` or `x // 2` if `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` or 3. If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is either the previous value of `ans` or `x // 2` if `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` or 3. Otherwise, `ans` is the previous value of `ans`.***
