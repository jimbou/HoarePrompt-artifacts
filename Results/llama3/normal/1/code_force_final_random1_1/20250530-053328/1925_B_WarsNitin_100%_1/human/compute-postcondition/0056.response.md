Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 2, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `ans` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and this difference is also divisible by `i`***
