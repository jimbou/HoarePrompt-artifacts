Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, q is 2, i is sqrt(x), sqrt(x) is an integer greater than or equal to 1, x is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), ans is 1.**

The code first reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to x and n. This reduces the number of lines in stdin by 1. The second line initializes ans to 1. No other variables are affected.
