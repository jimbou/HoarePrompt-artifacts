Output State: **stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 1, q is 0**

The code first reads an integer t from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^3. Then, for each of the t lines, it reads two integers x and n, where x is between 1 and 10^8, and n is between 1 and x. The value of x and n is assigned to the variables x and n respectively. The variable ans is initialized to 1. The variable q remains unchanged at 0. After the execution of the code, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x and n.
