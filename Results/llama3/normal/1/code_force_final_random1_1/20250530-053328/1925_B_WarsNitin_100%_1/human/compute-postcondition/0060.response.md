Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 2, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` minus the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and this difference is also divisible by `i`. Additionally, `x` divided by `i` is greater than 0. `ans` is `x` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise `ans` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. Since `i` is 1, `x // i` is equal to `x`. Therefore, `ans` is now equal to `x` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it remains 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
