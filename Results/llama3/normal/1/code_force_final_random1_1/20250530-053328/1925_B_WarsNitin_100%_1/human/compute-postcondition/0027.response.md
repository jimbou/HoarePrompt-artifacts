Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, q is 1, i is sqrt(x), sqrt(x) is greater than or equal to 0, x is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), ans is the maximum of 1 and the largest divisor of x that satisfies the conditions: (x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0) or (x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0), and the value of ans is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of x and n have been updated to the new values read from stdin. The value of ans has been initialized to 1, and it will be updated later based on the conditions specified in the problem. The other variables, q, i, and sqrt(x), remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers x and n.
