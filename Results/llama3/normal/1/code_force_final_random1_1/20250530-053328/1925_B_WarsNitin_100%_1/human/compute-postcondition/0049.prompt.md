Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, q is 1, i is sqrt(x), sqrt(x) is greater than or equal to 0, x is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), ans is the maximum of 1 and the largest divisor of x that satisfies the conditions: (x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0) or (x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0), and the value of ans is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
            i) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` % `i` == 0, then `ans` is either its previous value or `x` // `i` if `x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`) >= 0 and `x` // `i` > 0 and (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`)) % (`x` // `i`) == 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` % `i` == 0 and `x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`) >= 0 and `x` // `i` > 0 and (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`)) % (`x` // `i`) == 0, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x` // `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 3, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` is divisible by 3, then `ans` is either 3 or its previous value if it was already greater than 3 if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`. Otherwise, `ans` is either its previous value or `x // i` if `x // i` is greater than the previous value of `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
