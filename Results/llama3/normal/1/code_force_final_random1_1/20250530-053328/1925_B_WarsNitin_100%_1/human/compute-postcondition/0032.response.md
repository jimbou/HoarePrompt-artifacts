Postcondition: ***`x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` - `n` * `i` >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * `i`) % `i` == 0, then ans is the maximum of the previous maximum value of ans and `i`, and the value of ans is being printed. Otherwise, ans remains the same. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`.***
