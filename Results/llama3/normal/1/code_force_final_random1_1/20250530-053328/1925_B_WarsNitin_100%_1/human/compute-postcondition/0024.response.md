The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum of 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions: (`x` - `n` * `i` >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * `i`) % `i` == 0) or (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`) >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`)) % (`x` // `i`) == 0).

Since the exact values of `x`, `n`, and `i` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated maximum divisor.

Output: **the maximum of 1 and the largest divisor of x that satisfies the given conditions (where x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, and i is sqrt(x))**
