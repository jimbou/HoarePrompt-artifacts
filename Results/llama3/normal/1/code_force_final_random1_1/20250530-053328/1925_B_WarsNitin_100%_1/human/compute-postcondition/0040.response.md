Output State: **`x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` % `i` == 0, then `ans` is either its previous value or `x` // `i` if `x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`) >= 0 and `x` // `i` > 0 and (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`)) % (`x` // `i`) == 0. Otherwise, `ans` is either its previous value or 2. `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x` // `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x` divided by `i`. This means that if `x` is divisible by `i` (which is 2), `ans` will be updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x` divided by 2, as long as the conditions `x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`) >= 0, `x` // `i` > 0, and (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`)) % (`x` // `i`) == 0 are met. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `ans` will be updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 2.
