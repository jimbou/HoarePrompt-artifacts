To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `x` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `x` remains the same.

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 2, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**
