Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 2, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, `ans` is either the previous value of `ans` or 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-5` lines of input.
