Output State: **`ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and 2, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 0, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is greater than 2, `x` is greater than 4, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 2. The values of `x`, `n`, `q`, `i`, and `sqrt(x)` remain the same. The input in stdin is still the same, containing t-1 lines with two integers each.
