Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is the maximum of 1 and the largest divisor of x that satisfies the conditions: (x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0) or (x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0), q is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is greater than 0.***
