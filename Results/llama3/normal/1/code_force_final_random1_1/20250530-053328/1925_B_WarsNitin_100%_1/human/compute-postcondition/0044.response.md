Output State: **`x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 3, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, `ans` is either 3 or its previous value if it was already greater than 3, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-3 lines of input.
