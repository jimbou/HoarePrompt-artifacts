Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 0, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is greater than 2, `x` is greater than 4, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` is divisible by `i` (which is 2), then `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and either `x // 2` or 2, depending on whether `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` or `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
