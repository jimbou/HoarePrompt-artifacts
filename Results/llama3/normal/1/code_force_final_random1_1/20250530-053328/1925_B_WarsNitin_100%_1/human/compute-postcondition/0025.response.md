The code prints the value of `ans` which is the maximum of 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions: (`x` - `n` * `i` >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * `i`) % `i` == 0) or (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`) >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`)) % (`x` // `i`) == 0). Where `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 0, `i` is `sqrt(x)`, `sqrt(x)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).
Output: ** `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 0, `i` is `sqrt(x)`, `sqrt(x)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). `ans` is the maximum of 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions: (`x` - `n` * `i` >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * `i`) % `i` == 0) or (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`) >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`)) % (`x` // `i`) == 0), and the value of `ans` is being printed**
