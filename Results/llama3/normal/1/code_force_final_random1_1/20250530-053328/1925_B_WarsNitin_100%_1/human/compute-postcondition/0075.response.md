Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 2, `i` is `sqrt(x)`, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). `ans` is the maximum value between 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and for which `x - n * divisor` is greater than or equal to 0 and divisible by the divisor.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same constraints on `x`, `n`, `q`, and `stdin` as the initial state. The value of `i` will be equal to `sqrt(x)`, and `ans` will be the maximum value between 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and for which `x - n * divisor` is greater than or equal to 0 and divisible by the divisor.
