Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 0, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is greater than 2, `x` is greater than 4, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
