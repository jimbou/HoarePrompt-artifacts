Output State: **`x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), ans is the maximum of the previous maximum value of ans and `i`, and the value of ans is being printed. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, the current value of `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times `i` divided by `i` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
