The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `sqrt(x)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `sqrt(x)` must be greater than 2.
State: **stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is the maximum of 1 and the largest divisor of x that satisfies the conditions: (x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0) or (x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0), q is 0, `x` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is greater than 2**
