Postcondition: **`x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` % `i` == 0 and `x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`) >= 0 and `x` // `i` > 0 and (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`)) % (`x` // `i`) == 0, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x` // `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains its previous value.**
