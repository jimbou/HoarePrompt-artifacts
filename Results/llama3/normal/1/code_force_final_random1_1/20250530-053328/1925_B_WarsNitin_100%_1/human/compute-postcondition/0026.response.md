The only variable in the loop head is variable  q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `q` must be 1.
State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is `sqrt(x)`, `sqrt(x)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). `ans` is the maximum of 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions: (`x` - `n` * `i` >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * `i`) % `i` == 0) or (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`) >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`)) % (`x` // `i`) == 0), and the value of `ans` is being printed**
