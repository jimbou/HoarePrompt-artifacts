To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and `sqrt(x)`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `sqrt(x)` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is initialized to 1, we need to ensure that `sqrt(x)` is at least 2, so that the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 2, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `ans` is 1**
