The code prints the maximum value between 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and for which `x - n * divisor` is greater than or equal to 0 and divisible by the divisor.
Output: ** `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 2, `i` is `sqrt(x)`, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). `ans` is the maximum value between 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and for which `x - n * divisor` is greater than or equal to 0 and divisible by the divisor, and the maximum value between 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and for which `x - n * divisor` is greater than or equal to 0 and divisible by the divisor is being printed**
