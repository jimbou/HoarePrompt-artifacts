Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, `sqrt(x)` is greater than 0, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and the result of this subtraction is divisible by `i`, then ans is the maximum of 1 and `i`. Additionally, the current value of `x` minus `n` times the integer division of `x` by `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the integer division of `x` by `i` is greater than 0, and the result of the subtraction is divisible by the integer division of `x` by `i`. ans is the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. This means that `ans` now holds the maximum value between its previous value and the result of the integer division of `x` by `i`.
