Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers x and n. It then finds the largest divisor of x that satisfies certain conditions based on x and n, and prints the maximum of 1 and this largest divisor. The function repeats this process for each test case, until all test cases have been processed and standard input is empty.**
