Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 0, `i` is `sqrt(x)`, `sqrt(x)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). `ans` is the maximum of 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions: (`x` - `n` * `i` >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * `i`) % `i` == 0) or (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`) >= 0 and (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`)) % (`x` // `i`) == 0).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `x` and `n` remain within their initial ranges, `q` remains 0, and `i` has reached the square root of `x`. The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the given conditions. The state of the other variables, including the contents of stdin, remains unchanged.
