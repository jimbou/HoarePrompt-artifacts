To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8
- `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`
- `q` is 1
- `i` is 2
- `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 2
- `x` is greater than or equal to 4
- stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`)

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 because it is the loop variable, and the condition in the loop head (`i` in `range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1)`) must still be true. This means `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))` after the increment.

Since `i` is 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be 3. The value of `int(sqrt(x))` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`x`, `n`, `q`, and the contents of stdin) are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again. However, the description of `x` and `sqrt(x)` implies that `x` is a perfect square, and `sqrt(x)` is an integer. Since `i` is incremented and the loop condition depends on `int(sqrt(x))`, we need to ensure that `x` remains consistent with these conditions.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute again is:

State: **`x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 3, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**
