Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 2, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `x - n * i` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is either the previous value of `ans` or 2. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.***
