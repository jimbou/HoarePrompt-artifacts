The code prints the maximum value between 1 and the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and for which `x - n * divisor` is greater than or equal to 0 and divisible by the divisor.
Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value between 1 and the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to sqrt(x) and for which x - n * divisor is greater than or equal to 0 and divisible by the divisor)**
