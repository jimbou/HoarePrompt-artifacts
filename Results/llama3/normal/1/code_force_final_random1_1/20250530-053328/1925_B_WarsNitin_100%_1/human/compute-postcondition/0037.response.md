To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `x` remains the same, but we need to ensure that `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`x` is a perfect square between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` % `i` == 0, then `ans` is either its previous value or `x` // `i` if `x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`) >= 0 and `x` // `i` > 0 and (`x` - `n` * (`x` // `i`)) % (`x` // `i`) == 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same.**
