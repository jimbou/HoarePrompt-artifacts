Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is `len(s)-2`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the second element of the list `s`, `ans1` is either 1 or 2, `z` is 1, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 1. If the current value of the first element of the list `s` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1. If the current value of the first element of the list `s` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2 if `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans1` have also been updated to reflect the new value of `ans1`.
