Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with the first and k-th elements swapped and must have at least 3 elements, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is the third element of `s`. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.***
