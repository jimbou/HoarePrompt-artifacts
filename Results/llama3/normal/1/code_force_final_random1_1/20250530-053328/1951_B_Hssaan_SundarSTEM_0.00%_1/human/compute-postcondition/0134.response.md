Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice, ans is the number of elements in s that are less than or equal to h, h is the new first element of the list s, j is len(s)-1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, p is j, i is the last element of s, ans1 is 0, z is 0, and the maximum value between ans and ans1 is printed, _ is 2, and the maximum value between the number of elements in s that are less than or equal to h and the number of elements in s that are less than or equal to h and are equal to h if s[0] is not equal to h is printed.**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `k`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged. The list `s` has its first and k-th elements swapped twice, resulting in the same list as the initial state. The value of `p` is updated to be equal to `j`, which is `len(s)-1`. The value of `ans1` is reset to 0, and the value of `z` is set to 0. The maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is also printed.
