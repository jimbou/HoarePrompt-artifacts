Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0 plus 1. `i` is the second element in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `s` still has at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. The number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` is still `ans`. The new first element of the list `s` is still `h`. The length of the list `s` minus 1 is still `j`. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is still `j`. `i` is still the second element in the list.
