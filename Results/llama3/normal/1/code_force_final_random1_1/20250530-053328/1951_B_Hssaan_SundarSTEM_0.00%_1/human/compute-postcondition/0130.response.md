Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice, `ans` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the fourth element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `z` is 1, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 2, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This is because the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables.
