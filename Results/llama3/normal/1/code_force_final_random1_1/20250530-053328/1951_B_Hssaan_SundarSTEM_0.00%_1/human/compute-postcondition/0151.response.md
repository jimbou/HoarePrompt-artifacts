Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. `i` is the second element in the list. `ans1` is either 0 or 1 or `ans1` is increased by 1. `z` is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been increased by 1, but its initial value was either 0 or 1, so now it can be either 0, 1 or 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
