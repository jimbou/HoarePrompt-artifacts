Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. `i` is the second element in the list. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 0 or 1 or `ans1` is increased by 1, and `z` is 1. The maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged. However, the value of `z` is now 1. The conditions for `ans1` and the printed values are also updated accordingly.
