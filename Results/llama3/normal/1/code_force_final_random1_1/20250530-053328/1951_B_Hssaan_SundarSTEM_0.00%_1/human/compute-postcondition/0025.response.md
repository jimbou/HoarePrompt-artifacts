Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is either 0 or len(s)-2, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is len(s)-2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is len(s)-2, `z` is 0. If the first element of `s` is equal to the k-th element of the original list `s` (i.e., `s[0]` is equal to `h`), then `i` is the first element of `s` and equals the k-th element of the original list `s` (i.e., `i` equals `h`), and `ans1` is 0. Otherwise, `ans1` is 1. ***
