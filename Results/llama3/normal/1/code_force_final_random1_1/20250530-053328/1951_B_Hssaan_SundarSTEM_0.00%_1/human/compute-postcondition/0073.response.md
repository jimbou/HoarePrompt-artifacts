Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the second last element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`, `z` is 1, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: We have a list `s` with at least 3 elements where the first and k-th elements are swapped. The variable `ans` can be either 1 or 2. The variable `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. The variable `j` is 2. There are at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs in `stdin`. The variable `p` is equal to the length of `s` minus 2. The variable `i` is the second last element of `s`. The variable `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`. The variable `z` is 1. The maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed. The variable `_` is 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
