Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is the original list of integers, ans is either 0 or len(s)-2, h is the k-th element of the original list s, j is len(s)-2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, i is the last element of s, p is len(s)-2, ans1 is 0, z is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is either 0 or len(s)-2, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is len(s)-2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is len(s)-2. If the first element of `s` is equal to the k-th element of the original list `s` (i.e., `s[0]` is equal to `h`), then `i` is the first element of `s` and equals the k-th element of the original list `s` (i.e., `i` equals `h`), `z` is 1, and `ans1` is 0. If the first element of `s` is not equal to the k-th element of the original list `s`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `z` is 1, `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1; otherwise, the values of `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, `p`, `i` are as described in the precondition. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `z` is 1 and if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` equals 1, then `ans1` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k`, `s` has at least one more element, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, `p`, `i` is the next element in `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans` is increased by 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, otherwise no change is made to `ans`, and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
