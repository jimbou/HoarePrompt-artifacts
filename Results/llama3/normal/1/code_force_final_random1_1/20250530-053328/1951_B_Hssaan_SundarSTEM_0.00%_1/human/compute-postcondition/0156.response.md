Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. If `z` is 1, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0 plus 1. `i` is the second element in the list. If `z` is not 1, then no changes are made to `ans1` or `i`.***
