Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is either 0 or len(s)-2, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is len(s)-2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is the first element of `s` and equals the k-th element of the original list `s` (i.e., `i` equals `h`), `p` is len(s)-2, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 0. The first element of `s` is not equal to the k-th element of the original list `s` (i.e., `s[0]` is not equal to `h`).**

In this output state, all variables retain their original values except for `ans1`, which is now 1. The list `s` still has at least one element, and the relationship between `i` and `h` remains the same. The input in `stdin` is also unchanged.
