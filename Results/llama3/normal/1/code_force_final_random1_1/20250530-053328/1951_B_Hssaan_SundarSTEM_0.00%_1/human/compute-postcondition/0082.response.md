Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is `len(s)-2`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, the current value of `i` is equal to `h` and is the first element of the list `s`, `ans1` is either 0 or 1, `z` is 0, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 1. If the current value of the first element of the list `s` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 0. Otherwise, `ans1` is 1.***
