Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. `i` is the first element of `s`. `ans1` is 0. `z` is 0. The maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed. `_` is 2. The maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed. `i` is less than or equal to `h`.***
