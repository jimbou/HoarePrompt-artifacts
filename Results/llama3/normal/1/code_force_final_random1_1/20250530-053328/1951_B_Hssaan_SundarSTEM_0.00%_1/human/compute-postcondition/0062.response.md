Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the second last element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`, `z` is 1, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement that we broke out of.
