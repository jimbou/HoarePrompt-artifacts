Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. `i` is the third element in the list. `ans1` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `ans1` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
