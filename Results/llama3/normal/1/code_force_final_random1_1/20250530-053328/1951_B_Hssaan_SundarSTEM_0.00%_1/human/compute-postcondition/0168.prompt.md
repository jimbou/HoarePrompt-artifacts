Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice, ans is the number of elements in s that are less than or equal to h, h is the new first element of the list s, j is len(s)-1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, p is j, i is the last element of s, ans1 is 0, z is 0, and the maximum value between ans and ans1 is printed, _ is 2, and the maximum value between the number of elements in s that are less than or equal to h and the number of elements in s that are less than or equal to h and are equal to h if s[0] is not equal to h is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 0 or 1, `z` is 1, and the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` > `h`, the current value of `i` is greater than `h`, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. `i` is the second element in the list. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 0 or 1, `z` is 1, and the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` > `h`, the current value of `i` is greater than `h`, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` is larger than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
