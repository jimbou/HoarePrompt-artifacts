Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, `p`, `i`, `ans1`, `z`, `_` are as described in the precondition. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 0 if the current value of the first element of the list `s` is equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 1 if `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if the current value of the first element of the list `s` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 0 if `z` is not 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If the current value of the first element of the list `s` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0 if `z` is not 1, otherwise `ans1` is 2. The maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed.***
