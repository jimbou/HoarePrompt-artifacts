Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. `i` is the last element of `s`. `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`. `z` is 1 if `s[0]` is equal to `h`, otherwise `z` is 0. The maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed.**

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop iterates over the list `s`, and for each element `i`, it checks if `i` is equal to `h`, less than or equal to `h`, or greater than `h`. If `i` is equal to `h`, it sets `z` to 1 and increments `ans1` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, it increments `ans1` if `z` is 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, it breaks out of the loop. The final state of the variables reflects the results of these checks and updates.
