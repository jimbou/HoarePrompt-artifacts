Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, and `p` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
