Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is either 0 or len(s)-2, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is len(s)-2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is len(s)-2, `i` is the second element of `s`. If the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1.***
