Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with the first and k-th elements swapped and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 0, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s` and its current value is less than `i`, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is the second element of `s` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
