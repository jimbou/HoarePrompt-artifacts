Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. The current value of `i` is greater than `h`. `ans1` is 0. `z` is 0. The maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed. `_` is 2. The maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program flow is affected by the break statement.
