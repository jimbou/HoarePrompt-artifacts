Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with the first and k-th elements swapped, ans is 0, h is the k-th element of the original list s, j is -1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the first line of the input. The list `s` has its first and k-th elements swapped, as per the second line of code. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, and `h` is assigned the value of the k-th element of the original list `s`. The variable `j` is set to -1. The stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
