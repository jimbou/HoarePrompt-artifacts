To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `s`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of `s` starting from the second element (`s[1:]`). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second element of `s`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be the next element in the list `s`.

Since `s` is a list of integers with the first and k-th elements swapped and must have at least 2 elements, we can assume that `s` has at least 3 elements. Therefore, the next element in the list `s` would be the third element.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with the first and k-th elements swapped and must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is the third element of `s`.**
