Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped, `ans` is 1, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the second last element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`, `z` is 1, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 1, and `h` is greater than or equal to `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, becoming 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships. The list `s` still has its first and k-th elements swapped, and `h` remains the new first element of `s`. The values of `n`, `k`, `j`, `p`, `i`, `ans1`, `z`, and `_` are unchanged, and the relationship between `h` and `i` is still maintained. The maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is still printed, and the stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
