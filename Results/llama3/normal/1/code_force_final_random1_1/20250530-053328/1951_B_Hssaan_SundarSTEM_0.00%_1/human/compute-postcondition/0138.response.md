Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and the first and k-th elements swapped twice, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is `len(s)-1`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `j`, `i` is the first element of `s`, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 0, and the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 2, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed. The current value of `i` is not equal to the current value of `h`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `ans1` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `s` still has at least one element, and the first and k-th elements are still swapped twice. The value of `h` is still the new first element of the list `s`. The values of `n`, `k`, `j`, `p`, `i`, `z`, and `_` are unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is still printed, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is still printed. The current value of `i` is still not equal to the current value of `h`.
