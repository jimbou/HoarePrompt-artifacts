Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s` has at least one more element, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, `p`, `i` is the next element in `s`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans` is increased by 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, otherwise no change is made to `ans`, and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans` is increased by 1.***
