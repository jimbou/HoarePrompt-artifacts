Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with the first and k-th elements swapped and must have at least 4 elements, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is the fourth element of `s`, `ans` is either 1 or 2 if `h` is not less than `i`, otherwise we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is either 1 or 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2, depending on the condition `h` is not less than `i`. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but the value of `ans` is still either 1 or 2.
