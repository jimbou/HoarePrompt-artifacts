Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers: n and k, where n is the number of cows and k is the index of the cow of interest. The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans = 0
    h = s[0]
    j = -1
    for i in s[1:]:
        j += 1
        if h < i:
            break
        else:
            ans += 1
    p = j
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans1 = 0
    s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
    z = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == h:
            if s[0] != h:
                ans1 += 1
            z = 1
        elif i > h:
            break
        elif z == 1:
            ans1 += 1
    print(max(ans, ans1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is the original list of integers, `ans` is either 0 or len(s)-2, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is len(s)-2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is len(s)-2, `i` is the last element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`, `z` is 1, and the maximum value between ans and ans1 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is `len(s)-2`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the last element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `z` is 1, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 1, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. `i` is the last element of `s`. `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`. `z` is 1 if `s[0]` is equal to `h`, otherwise `z` is 0, and the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, which is the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
