Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice, ans is 0, h is the new first element of the list s, j is -1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, p is len(s)-2, i is the last element of s, ans1 is the number of elements in s that are less than or equal to h and are equal to h if s[0] is not equal to h, z is 1, the maximum value between ans and ans1 is printed, _ is 2, and the maximum value between the number of elements in s that are less than or equal to h and the number of elements in s that are less than or equal to h and are equal to h if s[0] is not equal to h is printed**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to n and k. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to s. The first and k-th elements of s are swapped twice, resulting in the original list. The variable ans is initialized to 0, and h is set to the new first element of s. The variable j is set to -1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
