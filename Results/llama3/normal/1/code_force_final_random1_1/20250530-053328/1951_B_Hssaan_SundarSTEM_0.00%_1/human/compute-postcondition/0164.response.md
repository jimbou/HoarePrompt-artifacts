Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. `i` is the third element in the list. `ans1` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `s` still has at least 3 elements, and the first and k-th elements are still swapped twice. The value of `h` is still the new first element of the list `s`. The values of `n`, `k`, `j`, `p`, and `i` are also unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
