Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is either 0 or len(s)-2, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is len(s)-2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is len(s)-2, `i` is the second element of `s`, `z` is 1, If the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, `p`, `i` remain the same as in the initial state. A new variable `z` is introduced and assigned the value 1. The condition regarding `ans1` still holds true, meaning if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1.
