To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for i in s[1:]:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is the third last element of `s`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be the next element in the list `s[1:]`.

Since `s` has at least 3 elements and the first and k-th elements are swapped, we can infer that `s[1:]` has at least 2 elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be the second last element of `s`.

The other variables in the loop head are `s`. However, the state of `s` is not directly modified by the loop head. The state of `s` is only modified by the loop body, which is not shown.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1 or 2, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the second last element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`, `z` is 1, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 1. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.**
