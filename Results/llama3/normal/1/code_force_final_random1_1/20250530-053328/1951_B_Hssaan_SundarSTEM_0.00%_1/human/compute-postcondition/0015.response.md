Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with the first and k-th elements swapped and must have at least 4 elements, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is the fourth element of `s`. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `i`, and `ans`. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The conditional statement regarding `h` and `i` and its effect on `ans` remains the same.
