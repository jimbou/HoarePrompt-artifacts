Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice, ans is the number of elements in s that are less than or equal to h, h is the new first element of the list s, j is len(s)-2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, p is len(s)-2, i is the last element of s, ans1 is 0, z is 0, the maximum value between ans and ans1 is printed, _ is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is `len(s)-2`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the first element of the list `s`, `ans1` is either 0 or 1, `z` is 1, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 1. If the current value of the first element of the list `s` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 0. If the current value of the first element of the list `s` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, `p`, `i`, `ans1`, `z`, `_` are as described in the precondition. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 0 if the current value of the first element of the list `s` is equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 1 if `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if the current value of the first element of the list `s` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 0 if `z` is not 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If the current value of the first element of the list `s` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `i` is less than or equal to `h` and `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0 if `z` is not 1, otherwise `ans1` is 2. The maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k`, `s` has at least one more element, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, `p`, `i` is the next element in the list `s`, `ans1`, `z`, `_` are as described in the precondition. If `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged, and `z` is 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise no change is made to `ans1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
