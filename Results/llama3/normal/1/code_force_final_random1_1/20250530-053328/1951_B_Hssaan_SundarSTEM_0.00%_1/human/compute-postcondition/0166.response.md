Postcondition: **`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. If `i` is larger than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is increased by 1.**
