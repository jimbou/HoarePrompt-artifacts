Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s` has at least one more element, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, `p`, `i` is the next element in the list `s`, `ans1`, `z`, `_` are as described in the precondition. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans1` is increased by 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise no change is made to `ans1`.***
