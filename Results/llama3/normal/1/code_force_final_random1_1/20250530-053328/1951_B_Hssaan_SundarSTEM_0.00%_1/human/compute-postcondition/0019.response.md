Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with the first and k-th elements swapped and must have at least `len(s)` elements, `ans` is either 0 or `len(s)-1`, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is `len(s)-2`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is the last element of `s`. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is either 0 or `len(s)-2`. Otherwise, `ans` is either `len(s)-2` or `len(s)-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` and `k` remain integers, `s` remains a list of integers with the first and k-th elements swapped, and `h` remains the k-th element of the original list `s`. The value of `j` is now `len(s)-2`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in `s` except the first one. The value of `ans` is either 0 or `len(s)-1`, depending on whether `h` is less than the last element of `s`. If `h` is less than the last element, the loop breaks and `ans` is either 0 or `len(s)-2`. Otherwise, `ans` is either `len(s)-2` or `len(s)-1`.
