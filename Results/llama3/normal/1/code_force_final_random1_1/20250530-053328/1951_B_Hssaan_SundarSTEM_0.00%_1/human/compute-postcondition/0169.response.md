The `print(max(ans, ans1))` statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1`. 

`ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. 

`ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`. 

Since `s[0]` is the new first element of the list `s` which is `h`, `ans1` will be equal to `ans`. 

Therefore, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` will be `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of elements in s that are less than or equal to h)**
