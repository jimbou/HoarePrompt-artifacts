Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the third last element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`, `z` is 1, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 1**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
