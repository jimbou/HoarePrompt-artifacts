Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is the modified list of integers with the first and k-th elements swapped, ans is 0, h is the new first element of the list s, j is -1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, p is len(s)-2, i is the last element of s, ans1 is the number of elements in s that are less than or equal to h and not equal to the first element of s, z is 1, the maximum value between ans and ans1 is printed, _ is 1
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the second last element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`, `z` is 1, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 1. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `h` is greater than or equal to `i` and `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1 or 2, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the third last element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`, `z` is 1, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 1. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped, `ans` is either 1, 2 or 3, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the second last element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`, `z` is 1, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 1. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2 if `h` is not less than `i` or `ans` is either 2 or 3 if `h` is not less than `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
