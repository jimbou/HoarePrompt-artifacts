Output State: **`n`, `k`, `s` has at least one more element, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, `p`, `i` is the next element in the list `s`, `ans1`, `z`, `_` are as described in the precondition and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, `p`, `i`, `ans1`, `z`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `s` still has at least one more element. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
