To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. The loop will execute if `s` has at least one element after the first one (i.e., `s` must have at least two elements). 

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with the first and k-th elements swapped and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 0, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is -1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is the second element of `s`**
