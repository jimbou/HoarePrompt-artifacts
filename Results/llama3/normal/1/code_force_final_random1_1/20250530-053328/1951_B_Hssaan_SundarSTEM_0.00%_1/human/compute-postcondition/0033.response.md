Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is either 0 or len(s)-2, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is len(s)-2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `i` is the first element of `s`, `p` is len(s)-2, `i` is not equal to `h`, and `i` is less than or equal to `h`. If `z` is 1, then `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged.***
