Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is `len(s)-2`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the first element of the list `s`, `ans1` is 0 if `i` is greater than `h`, otherwise `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 1, `z` is 1 if `i` is less than or equal to `h`, otherwise `z` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
