Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is either 0 or len(s)-2, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is len(s)-2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is len(s)-2, `i` is the second element of `s`, `ans1` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans1` is incremented by 1, while the values of all other variables remain unchanged. The list `s` still has at least 2 elements, and the values of `n`, `k`, `h`, `j`, `p`, and `i` are preserved. The number of test cases in `stdin` is also unchanged.
