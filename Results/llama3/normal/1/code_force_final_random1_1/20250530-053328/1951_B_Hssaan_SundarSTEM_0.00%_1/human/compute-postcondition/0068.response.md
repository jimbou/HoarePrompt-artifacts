Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the third last element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`, `z` is 1, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
