Postcondition: **`n`, `k` are integers. `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `h` is the new first element of the list `s`. `j` is `len(s)-1`. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. `p` is `j`. If `i` is greater than `h`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed.**
