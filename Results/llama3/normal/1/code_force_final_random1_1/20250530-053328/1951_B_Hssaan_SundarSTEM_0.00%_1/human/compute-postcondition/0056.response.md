The code prints the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1`. `ans` is either 0 or `len(s)-2`, and `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`. `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`. 
Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is the original list of integers, `ans` is either 0 or len(s)-2, `h` is the k-th element of the original list `s`, `j` is len(s)-2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is len(s)-2, `i` is the last element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and not equal to the first element of `s`, `z` is 1, and the maximum value between ans and ans1 is printed**
