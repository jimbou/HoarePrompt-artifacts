Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and k-th elements swapped twice, `ans` is 0, `h` is the new first element of the list `s`, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `p` is `len(s)-2`, `i` is the second element of `s`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `z` is 1, the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is printed, `_` is 2, and the maximum value between the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and the number of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h` and are equal to `h` if `s[0]` is not equal to `h` is printed. Additionally, `h` is not less than `i`.***
