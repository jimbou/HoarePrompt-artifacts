Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `stdin`, `p`, `i` are as described in the precondition. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `z` is 1 and if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` equals 1, then `ans1` is increased by 1.***
