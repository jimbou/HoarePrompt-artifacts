Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. The program correctly calculates the MEX (Minimum Excluded Value) for each prefix of the array `a`. It does this by maintaining a set `used` of all numbers that have been used so far and a variable `minn` that keeps track of the smallest unused number.
3. When `arr[i] > 0`, the program correctly calculates the MEX by appending `minn` to the `mex` list and updating `minn` to the next unused number.
4. When `arr[i] <= 0`, the program correctly calculates the MEX by appending `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list and updating `minn` to the next unused number.
5. The program correctly prints the calculated MEX values.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
