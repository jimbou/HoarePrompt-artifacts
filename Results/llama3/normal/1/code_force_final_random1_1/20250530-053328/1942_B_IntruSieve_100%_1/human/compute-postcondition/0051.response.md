Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers between -n and n, `mex` is a list of n integers that must have at least n integers, `itm` is the last integer in the list, `used` is a dictionary containing all integers between 0 and n as keys with value True, `minn` is n + 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is n, and all integers in the list `mex` have been printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, it will have printed all the integers in the list `mex`, which has at least `n` integers. The other variables remain unchanged.
