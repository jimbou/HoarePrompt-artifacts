Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and `minn`, `used` is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` as a key with value `True`, `minn` is within the range of values that can be stored in `used` and `minn` is increased by 1 and `minn` is in `used`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `minn` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `minn` is still within the range of values that can be stored in `used`, and it is still present in `used`. The list `mex` still contains the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and `minn`. The dictionary `used` still contains the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` as a key with value `True`. The list `arr` remains a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, and `n` is still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The variable `i` is still 1, and `stdin` is still empty.
