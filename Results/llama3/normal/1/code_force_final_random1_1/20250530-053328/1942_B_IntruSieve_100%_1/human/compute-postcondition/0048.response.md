The only object in the loop head is variable `itm` and list `mex`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `mex`.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `mex` has at least 2 integers, `itm` is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the `itm` is the third integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers between -n and n, `mex` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `itm` is the third integer in the list, `used` is a dictionary containing all integers between 0 and n as keys with value True, `minn` is n + 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is n**
