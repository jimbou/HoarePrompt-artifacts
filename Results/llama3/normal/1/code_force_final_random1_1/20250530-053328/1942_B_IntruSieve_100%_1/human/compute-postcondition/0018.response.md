Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and `minn`, `used` is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` as a key with value `True`, `minn` is within the range of values that can be stored in `used` and `minn` is increased by 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `mex` still contains the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and the original value of `minn` and the original value of `minn`. The dictionary `used` still contains the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and the original value of `minn` as a key with value `True` and the original value of `minn` as a key with value `True`. The value of `minn` is now within the range of values that can be stored in `used` and is one more than its original value. The input `stdin` is still empty, and the value of `i` is still 1.
