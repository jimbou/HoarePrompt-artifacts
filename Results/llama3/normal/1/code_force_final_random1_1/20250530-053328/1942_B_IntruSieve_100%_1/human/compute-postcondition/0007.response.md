Output State: **`mex` is [0], `used` is {0: True, 2: True}, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `minn` is 2, stdin is empty, `i` is 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0**

The code increments the value of `minn` by 1. The initial value of `minn` was 1, so after the increment, `minn` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
