Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, stdin is empty, i is 2, n is greater than 2. If arr[i] > 0, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True and minn as a key with value True and minn + 2 as a key with value True and minn + 1 as a key with value True, minn is increased by 1 until it is not in used. If arr[i] <= 0, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True, minn is n + 1, mex has two more elements which are the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used has two more key-value pairs with key as the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn and value True.***
