The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n. If arr[i] > 0, mex is [0], used is {0: True, 2: True, 3: True, ... , n: True}, minn is n + 1, stdin is empty, i is 1. Otherwise, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True. In both cases, n is greater than 1**
