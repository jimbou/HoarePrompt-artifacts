Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and `minn`, `used` is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` as a key with value `True`, `minn` is within the range of values that can be stored in `used` and `minn` is increased by 1 and `minn` must be in `used`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1 and `minn` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `minn` is increased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The list `mex` still contains the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and the original value of `minn`, and the dictionary `used` still contains the absolute difference between each element in `arr` and the original value of `minn` as keys with value `True`, as well as the original value of `minn` as a key with value `True`. The value of `minn` is now one more than its original value, and it is still within the range of values that can be stored in `used`. The input `stdin` is still empty, and the value of `i` is still 1.
