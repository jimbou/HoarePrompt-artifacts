The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n. If arr[i] > 0, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True and minn as a key with value True, minn is not in used, stdin is empty, i is 2. If arr[i] <= 0, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True, minn is n + 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, mex has one more element which is the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used has one more key-value pair with key as the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn and value True. In both cases, n is greater than 2.**
