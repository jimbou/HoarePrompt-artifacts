According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mex`. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `minn` is n + 1. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the `itm` is the first integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers between -n and n, `mex` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `itm` is the first integer in the list, `used` is a dictionary containing all integers between 0 and n as keys with value True, `minn` is n + 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is n**
