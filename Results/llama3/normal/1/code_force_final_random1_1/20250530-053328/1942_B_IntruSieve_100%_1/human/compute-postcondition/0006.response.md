To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `minn` and `used`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `minn` is in `used`. If `minn` is not in `used`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `minn` is 1 and `used` is {0: True}.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `used` so that it does not contain `minn` (which is 1). We can do this by adding a new key-value pair to `used` with a key that is not equal to `minn`. Let's add a new key-value pair with key 2 and value True.

State: **`mex` is [0], `used` is {0: True, 2: True}, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `minn` is 1, stdin is empty, `i` is 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0**
