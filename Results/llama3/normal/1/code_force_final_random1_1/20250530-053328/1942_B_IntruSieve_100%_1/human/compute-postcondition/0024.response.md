Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and `minn`, `used` is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` as a key with value `True`, `minn` is not in `used`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `minn` is not in `used`, indicating that the loop has found a value for `minn` that is not present in the `used` dictionary. This means that the loop has successfully found a value for `minn` that is not already used by any of the elements in the `arr` list. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` still being a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `mex` still being a list containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and `minn`, `used` still being a dictionary containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` as a key with value `True`, and `stdin` still being empty.
