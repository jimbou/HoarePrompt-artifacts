This function reads an integer n and a list of n integers from standard input, calculates the minimum excluded value (MEX) for each integer in the list, and prints the MEX values. The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not perform any error checking. It uses a dictionary to keep track of used values and calculates the MEX by iterating through the list and updating the minimum excluded value accordingly. The function prints the MEX values separated by spaces, followed by a newline character.
