Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, used is an empty dictionary, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > 0:
        mex.append(minn)
        used[minn] = True
        while minn in used:
            minn += 1
    else:
        mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
        used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n. If arr[i] > 0, mex is [0], used is {0: True, 2: True, 3: True, ... , n: True}, minn is n + 1, stdin is empty, i is 0. Otherwise, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True. In both cases, n is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n. If arr[i] > 0, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True and minn as a key with value True, minn is not in used, stdin is empty, i is 1. If arr[i] <= 0, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True, minn is n + 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, mex has one more element which is the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used has one more key-value pair with key as the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn and value True. In both cases, n is greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, stdin is empty, i is 2, n is greater than 2. If arr[i] > 0, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True and minn as a key with value True and minn + 2 as a key with value True and minn + 1 as a key with value True, minn is increased by 1 until it is not in used. If arr[i] <= 0, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True, minn is n + 1, mex has two more elements which are the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used has two more key-value pairs with key as the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn and value True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
