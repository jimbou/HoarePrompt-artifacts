Output State: `mex` is [0], `used` is {0: True, 2: True, 3: True, ... , n: True}, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `minn` is n + 1, stdin is empty, `i` is 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `minn` has been incremented until it is no longer in the `used` set, which means it has reached a value of `n + 1`. The `used` set now contains all integers from 0 to `n`, inclusive. The other variables remain unchanged.
