The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value of `minn` to the list `mex`. Since `minn` is 0, `mex` becomes [0]. The second line assigns the value `True` to the key `minn` in the dictionary `used`. Since `minn` is 0, `used` becomes {0: True}.

Output State: **mex is [0], used is {0: True}, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, minn is 0, stdin is empty, i is 0, and the current value of arr[i] is greater than 0**
