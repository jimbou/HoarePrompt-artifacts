Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses a dictionary `used` to keep track of the used values in the permutation and calculates the minimum excluded value (MEX) for each integer in the array. The program then prints the MEX values, which represent the permutation `p`.

The program handles both cases where `a_i` is positive and negative correctly. When `a_i` is positive, it means that the MEX of the permutation up to that point is equal to `a_i`. The program then appends the current MEX value to the `mex` list and updates the `used` dictionary. When `a_i` is negative, it means that the MEX of the permutation up to that point is equal to `abs(a_i) - minn`, where `minn` is the current minimum excluded value. The program then appends this value to the `mex` list and updates the `used` dictionary.

The program also handles the case where `a_i` is equal to 0 correctly. In this case, the MEX of the permutation up to that point is equal to the current minimum excluded value `minn`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
