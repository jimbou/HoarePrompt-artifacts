The code prints the second integer in the list `mex`, which is `itm`. Since the exact value of `itm` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `itm`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the second integer in the list `mex`.

Output: **itm (where itm is the second integer in the list mex)**
