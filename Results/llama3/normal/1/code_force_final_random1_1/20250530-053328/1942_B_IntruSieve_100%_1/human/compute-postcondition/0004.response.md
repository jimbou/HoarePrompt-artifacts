The only variable in the loop head is variable minn and used, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable minn and used.  If minn is in used, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, minn is 0 and used is {0: True}, So for the loop to  executed the first time minn must be 0 and used must be {0: True}.
State: **mex is [0], used is {0: True}, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, minn is 0, stdin is empty, i is 0, and the current value of arr[i] is greater than 0**
