Output State: `mex` is [0], `used` is {0: True, 1: True, 2: True, 3: True}, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `minn` is 4, stdin is empty, `i` is 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that `minn` has been incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop executes until `minn` is no longer in `used`, and `used` contains all integers from 0 to 3, the loop will execute 4 times, incrementing `minn` to 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
