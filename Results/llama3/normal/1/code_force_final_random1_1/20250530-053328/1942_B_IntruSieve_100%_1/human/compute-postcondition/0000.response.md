The code snippet reads an integer `n` from stdin, representing the number of elements in the array `arr`. It then reads `n` integers from stdin and stores them in `arr`. The variable `mex` is initialized as an empty list, `minn` is set to 0, and `used` is initialized as an empty dictionary.

After executing the code, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, used is an empty dictionary, stdin is empty**

In this output state, `n` has been assigned a value between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `arr` contains `n` integers between -n and n. The variables `mex`, `minn`, and `used` have been initialized but not modified. Stdin is now empty, as all input has been read and processed.
