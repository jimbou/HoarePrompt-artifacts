The variable in the loop head is `minn` and `used`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `minn` and `used`.  If `minn` is in `used`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `minn` is in `used`, So for the loop to be executed one more time `minn` must be in `used` again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and `minn`, `used` is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` as a key with value `True`, `minn` is within the range of values that can be stored in `used` and `minn` is increased by 1 and `minn` must be in `used`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**
