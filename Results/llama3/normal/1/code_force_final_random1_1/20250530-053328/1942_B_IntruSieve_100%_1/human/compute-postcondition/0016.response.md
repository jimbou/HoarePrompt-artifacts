Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True and minn as a key with value True, minn is n + 1, stdin is empty, i is 1.**

In this output state, the code has appended the value of `minn` to the `mex` list and added `minn` as a key to the `used` dictionary with a value of `True`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
