Output State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and `minn`, `used` is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` as a key with value `True`, `minn` is the smallest integer that is not in `used`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `minn` is the smallest integer that is not in `used`. This means that the loop will continue to increment `minn` until it finds a value that is not present in the `used` dictionary. At this point, the loop will terminate, and `minn` will be the smallest integer that is not in `used`. The other variables remain unchanged.
