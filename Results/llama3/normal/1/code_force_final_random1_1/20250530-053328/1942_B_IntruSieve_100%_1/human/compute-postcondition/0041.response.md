Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is a list of n integers, used is a dictionary containing all integers between 0 and n as keys with value True, minn is n + 1, stdin is empty, i is n.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the variables have reached their final state. The list `mex` now contains `n` integers, which are the results of the calculations performed inside the loop. The dictionary `used` contains all integers between 0 and `n` as keys with value `True`, indicating that all these values have been used in the calculations. The variable `minn` has been incremented to `n + 1`, and the loop counter `i` has reached its final value of `n`. The other variables, `n`, `arr`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
