Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation p based on the array a. The issue lies in the way the program handles the case when arr[i] is negative. The program simply appends the absolute value of arr[i] minus minn to the mex list, which is not correct.

A counterexample is when the input is:

3
-2 1 2

The program will output:

2 0 1

However, this is not a valid permutation p that satisfies the array a. The correct output should be:

2 0 1

But the program does not correctly calculate the permutation p.

The correct approach would be to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation p, and use this information to construct the permutation p. The program should also handle the case when arr[i] is negative correctly, by subtracting the absolute value of arr[i] from the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation p.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
