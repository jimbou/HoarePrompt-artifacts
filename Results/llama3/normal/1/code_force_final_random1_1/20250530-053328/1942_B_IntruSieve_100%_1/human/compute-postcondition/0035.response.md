Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between `-n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and `minn`, `used` is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` + 2 as a key with value `True` and `minn` + 1 as a key with value `True`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `minn` is increased by 1**

The value of `minn` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state is the same as the initial state, except that `minn` is increased by 1.
