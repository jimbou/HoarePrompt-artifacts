Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n. If arr[i] > 0, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True and minn as a key with value True, minn is not in used, stdin is empty, i is 1. If arr[i] <= 0, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True, minn is n + 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, mex has one more element which is the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used has one more key-value pair with key as the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn and value True. In both cases, n is greater than 1.***
