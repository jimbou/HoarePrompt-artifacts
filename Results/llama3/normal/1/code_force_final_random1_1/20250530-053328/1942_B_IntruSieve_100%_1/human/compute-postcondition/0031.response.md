Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between `-n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and `minn`, `used` is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` as a key with value `True`, `minn` must be in `used`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `minn` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `mex` still contains the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and the original value of `minn`, and the dictionary `used` still contains the original value of `minn` as a key with value `True`. The value of `i` remains 2, and the input stream `stdin` is still empty.
