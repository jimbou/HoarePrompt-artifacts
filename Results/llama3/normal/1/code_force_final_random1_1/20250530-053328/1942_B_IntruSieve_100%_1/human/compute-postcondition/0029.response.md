Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True and minn as a key with value True, minn is not in used, stdin is empty, i is 2.**

The code appends the value of `minn` to the `mex` list and adds `minn` as a key with value `True` to the `used` dictionary. Since `minn` is not in `used` initially, this addition does not overwrite any existing value. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
