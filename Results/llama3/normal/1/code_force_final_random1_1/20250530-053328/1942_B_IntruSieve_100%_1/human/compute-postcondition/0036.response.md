Output State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between `-n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and `minn`, `used` is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and all integers from `minn` to `n` as keys with value `True`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `minn` is `n` + 1.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `minn` has been incremented until it is no longer in the `used` dictionary, which means it has reached a value of `n` + 1. The `used` dictionary now contains all integers from the original value of `minn` to `n` as keys with value `True`. The other variables remain unchanged.
