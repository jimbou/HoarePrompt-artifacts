Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, stdin is empty, i is 2, n is greater than 2, arr[i] is less than or equal to 0, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True, minn is n + 1, mex has two more elements which are the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used has two more key-value pairs with key as the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn and value True**

In this output state, the code has appended the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the `mex` list twice, and added two new key-value pairs to the `used` dictionary with the same absolute difference as the key and `True` as the value. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
