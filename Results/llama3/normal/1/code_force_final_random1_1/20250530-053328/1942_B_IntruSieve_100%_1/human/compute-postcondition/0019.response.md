According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `minn` and `used`. If `minn` is in `used`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `minn` is within the range of values that can be stored in `used` and `minn` is increased by 1. `minn` being within the range of values that can be stored in `used` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `minn` is within the range of values that can be stored in `used` and `minn` is increased by 1 and `minn` is in `used`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and `minn`, `used` is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` as a key with value `True`, `minn` is within the range of values that can be stored in `used` and `minn` is increased by 1 and `minn` is in `used`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**
