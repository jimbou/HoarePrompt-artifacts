Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True, stdin is empty, i is 0, n is greater than 0, and arr[i] is less than or equal to 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the absolute difference between the current element in the array `arr` at index `i` and the value of `minn` to the list `mex`. Since `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0 and `minn` is 0, the absolute difference will be equal to the absolute value of `arr[i]`. Therefore, `mex` will contain the absolute value of `arr[i]`.

The second line adds an entry to the dictionary `used` with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` as the key and `True` as the value. Since the absolute difference is the same as in the first line, the key will be the absolute value of `arr[i]`.

The values of `n`, `arr`, `stdin`, `i`, and `n` are not modified by the code snippet, so they remain the same. The value of `minn` is also not modified, so it remains 0.

Therefore, the final output state is as described above.
