Output State: **`mex` is [0], `used` is {0: True}, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `minn` is 1, stdin is empty, `i` is 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `minn` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `mex` still being [0], `used` still being {0: True}, `n` still being an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` still being a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, stdin still being empty, `i` still being 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` still being greater than 0.
