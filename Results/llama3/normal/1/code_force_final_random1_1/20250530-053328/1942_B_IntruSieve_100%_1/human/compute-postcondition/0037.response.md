Output State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between `-n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and `minn`, `used` is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` as a key with value `True` and `minn` + 2 as a key with value `True` and `minn` + 1 as a key with value `True`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `minn` is increased by 1 until it is not in `used`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `minn` will continue to increment by 1 until it is no longer present in the `used` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` and `arr` retaining their initial values, `mex` containing the absolute differences and `minn`, `used` containing the absolute differences and `minn` as keys with value `True`, and `stdin` remaining empty. The loop will terminate when `minn` is not found in `used`, indicating that `minn` has reached a value that is not present in the `used` dictionary.
