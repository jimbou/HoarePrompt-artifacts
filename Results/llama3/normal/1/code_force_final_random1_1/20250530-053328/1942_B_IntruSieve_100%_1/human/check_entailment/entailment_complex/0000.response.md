Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described, which involves constructing a permutation `p` based on an array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program correctly calculates the MEX values for each integer in the array `a` and prints them.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, and the array `a`.
2. The program initializes the `mex` list, `used` dictionary, and `minn` variable correctly.
3. The program iterates through the array `a` and calculates the MEX values correctly. For each element `arr[i]`, it checks if `arr[i] > 0`. If true, it appends the current `minn` value to the `mex` list and updates `minn` to the next unused value. If `arr[i] <= 0`, it appends the absolute difference between `minn` and `arr[i]` to the `mex` list and updates `minn` accordingly.
4. The program prints the calculated MEX values correctly, separated by spaces, followed by a newline character.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required calculations. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
