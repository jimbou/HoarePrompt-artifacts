Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n. If arr[i] > 0, mex is [0], used is {0: True, 2: True, 3: True, ... , n: True}, minn is n + 1, stdin is empty, i is 0. Otherwise, mex is a list containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn, used is a dictionary containing the absolute difference between arr[i] and minn as a key with value True. In both cases, n is greater than 0.***
