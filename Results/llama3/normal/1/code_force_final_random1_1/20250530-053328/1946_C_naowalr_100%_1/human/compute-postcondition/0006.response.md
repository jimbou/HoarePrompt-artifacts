Output State: **The function `solve()` has been executed, `sys.stdin.readline()` returns a string that can be converted to an integer greater than or equal to the number of sets of input data, `_` is equal to the number of sets of input data minus 1.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed for each set of input data in stdin, and the variable `_` has been incremented for each iteration, finally reaching a value equal to the number of sets of input data minus 1. The function `solve()` has been executed for each iteration, and `sys.stdin.readline()` has returned a string that can be converted to an integer greater than or equal to the number of sets of input data, indicating that the loop has executed for all available input data.
