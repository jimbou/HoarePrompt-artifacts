The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and the expression `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. If this value is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(sys.stdin.readline())` is greater than 1, `_` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 2 and `_` is 2.
State: **`solve()` has been executed, `sys.stdin.readline()` returns a string that can be converted to an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2**
