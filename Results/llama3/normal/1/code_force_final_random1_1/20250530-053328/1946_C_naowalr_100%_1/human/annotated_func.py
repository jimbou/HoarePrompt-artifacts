#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a sequence of sets of input data, where each set starts with a line containing two integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines, each containing two integers v and u.
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: The function `solve()` has been executed, `sys.stdin.readline()` returns a string that can be converted to an integer greater than or equal to the number of sets of input data, `_` is equal to the number of sets of input data minus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a sequence of sets of input data from standard input, where each set starts with a line containing two integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines, each containing two integers v and u, and executes the solve() function for each set of input data, with the number of sets determined by the integer read from standard input.
