To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `sys.stdin.readline()`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. If this value is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `sys.stdin.readline()` to ensure that it returns a value that can be converted to an integer greater than 0.

State: **`sys.stdin.readline()` returns a string that can be converted to an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0**
