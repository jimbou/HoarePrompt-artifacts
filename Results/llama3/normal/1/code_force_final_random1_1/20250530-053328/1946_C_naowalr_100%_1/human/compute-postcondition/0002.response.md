To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `solve()` has been executed (this is not relevant to the loop head)
* `sys.stdin.readline()` returns a string that can be converted to an integer greater than 0
* `_` is 0

To execute the loop again, the condition `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than the current value of `_`. Since `_` is 0, the condition must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, the state of the objects in the loop head must be adjusted as follows:

* `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` is 1
* `sys.stdin.readline()` must return a string that can be converted to an integer greater than 1

The state of `solve()` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains the same.

State: **`solve()` has been executed, `sys.stdin.readline()` returns a string that can be converted to an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1**
