Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input, y is an integer from the input minus c, sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus 2 times y if y is less than c, otherwise sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus 2 times y plus i, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in l minus 1, where even numbers come first and must have at least 1 element, c is half of the first element in the list val, i is the first element in the list val, stdin contains -1 test cases, cons is not printed.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been decremented by `c`, and the value of `sx` has been incremented by `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
