Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input, y is an integer from the input minus the sum of half of each element in the list val, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is an empty list, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, stdin contains -1 test cases, and the value of cons is printed, where cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    if c == 1:
        sx += 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and is greater than 0, `y` is an integer from the input minus the sum of half of each element in the list `val`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing the value `c`, `cons` is the minimum of `n` - 2 and `x` + `sx` - 2, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, and the value of `cons` is printed, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` minus 1 is 1, then `sx` is 1. Otherwise, `sx` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and is greater than 1, `y` is an integer from the input minus the sum of half of each element in the list `val`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing the value `l[2] - l[1] - 1` and `c`, `cons` is the minimum of `n` - 2 and `x` + `sx` - 2, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, and the value of `cons` is printed, `i` is 2. If `c` is equal to 1, then `sx` is increased by 1 and `cons` is the minimum of `n` - 2 and `x` + `sx` - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and is greater than 1, `y` is an integer from the input minus the sum of half of each element in the list `val`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing the value `l[2] - l[1] - 1` and `c` and `c`, `cons` is the minimum of `n` - 2 and `x` + `sx` - 1, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, and the value of `cons` is printed, `i` is 3, `c` is equal to `l[3] - l[2] - 1`, if `c` is equal to 1, `sx` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `sx` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
