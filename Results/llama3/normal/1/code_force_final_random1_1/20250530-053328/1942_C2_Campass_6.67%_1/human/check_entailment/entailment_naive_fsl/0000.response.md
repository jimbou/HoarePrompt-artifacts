Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. It first sorts the chosen vertices and calculates the number of gaps between them. It then sorts these gaps in a way that prioritizes the gaps with an even number of vertices, as these can be divided into two non-intersecting diagonals. The program then iterates over these gaps, adding as many non-intersecting diagonals as possible to each gap, until it runs out of vertices to choose or reaches the maximum number of vertices it can choose.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of gaps is less than the maximum number of vertices that can be chosen, in which case it simply adds all the gaps to the total number of non-intersecting diagonals.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake. Therefore, it is correct for all potential cases.
