The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and val, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the val.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, val has at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element in the list.
State: **t is 0, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input, y is an integer from the input minus 2 times c, sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus 3 times y plus i if y is less than c, otherwise sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus 5 times y plus i, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in l minus 1, where even numbers come first and must have at least 3 elements, c is a quarter of the first element in the list val, i is the third element in the list val, stdin contains -1 test cases, cons is not printed.**
