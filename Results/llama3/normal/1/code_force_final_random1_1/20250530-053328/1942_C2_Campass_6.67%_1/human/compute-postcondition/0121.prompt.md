Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, t is 1 less than its original value.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        if c == 1:
            sx += 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    cons = min(n - 2, cons)
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is y minus the sum of all c in val, l is a sorted list of integers with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing c which is l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1 for i from 1 to x, where even numbers come first in ascending order and odd numbers come next in ascending order, sx is the sum of all c which are 1 plus 2 times y if y is less than c, otherwise sx is the sum of all c which are 1, plus the sum of all i in val, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, stdin contains 0 test cases, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2)
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is 0, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input, y is an integer from the input minus the sum of half of each element in the list val, sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus the sum of each element in the list val, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in l minus 1, where even numbers come first, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, stdin contains -1 test cases, and the value of cons is printed, where cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, sx is the sum of all c values where c is equal to 1 plus the sum of all elements in the list, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the values c where even numbers come first, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, i is the last element in the list, c is equal to half of the last element in the list, y is the first element in the list minus half of the first element in the list minus half of the last element in the list, and stdin contains -1 test cases. If y is less than c, then sx is updated to include twice the value of y, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
