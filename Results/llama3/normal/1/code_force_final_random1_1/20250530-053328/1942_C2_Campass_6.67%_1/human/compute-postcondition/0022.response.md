Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer and is at least 1, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers with `n +` the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing at least 1 `c` which is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x`, where even numbers come first in ascending order and odd numbers come next in ascending order, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `sx` is the sum of all `c` which are 1, `i` is the first element in `val`, `c` is half of the first element in `val`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `l`, `val`, `stdin`, and `sx` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still the first element in `val`. A new variable `c` is introduced, which is half of the first element in `val`.
