Output State: **`t` is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and is greater than 1, `y` is an integer from the input minus the sum of half of each element in the list `val`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing the value `l[2] - l[1] - 1` and `c`, `cons` is the minimum of `n` - 2 and `x` + `sx` - 2, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, and the value of `cons` is printed, `i` is 2. If `c` is equal to 1, then `sx` is increased by 1 and `cons` is the minimum of `n` - 2 and `x` + `sx` - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `val` has been updated to include the value of `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cons` is still printed, and the stdin still contains -1 test cases. The value of `i` is still 2. If `c` is equal to 1, then `sx` is increased by 1 and `cons` is updated accordingly.
