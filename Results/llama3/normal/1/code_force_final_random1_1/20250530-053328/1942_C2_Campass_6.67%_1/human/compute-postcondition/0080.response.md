Output: **t is 0, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input, y is an integer from the input minus the sum of half of each element in the list val, sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus the sum of each element in the list val, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in l minus 1, where even numbers come first, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, stdin contains -1 test cases, and the value of cons is printed, where cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2**
