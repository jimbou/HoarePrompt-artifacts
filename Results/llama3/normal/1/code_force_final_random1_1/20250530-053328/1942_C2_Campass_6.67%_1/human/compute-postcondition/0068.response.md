Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input minus `c`, `sx` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `l` is 1 plus 2 times `y` if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise `sx` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `l` is 1 plus 2 times `y` plus `i`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in `l` minus 1, where even numbers come first and must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a quarter of the first element in the list `val`, `i` is the second element in the list `val`, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, `cons` is not printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `c` has been updated to be a quarter of the first element in the list `val`, which is half of its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
