Postcondition: ***t is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, sx is the sum of all c values where c is equal to 1, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the values c where even numbers come first and must have at least 1 element, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, i is the first element in the list, c is half of the first element in the list, and stdin contains -1 test cases. If y is less than c, then y is added to sx twice. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
