Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing `l[1] - l[0] - 1` and `l[2] - l[1] - 1`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 3. If `c` is 1, then `sx` is 2 if `l[2] - l[1] - 1` is 1, otherwise `sx` is 2. If `c` is not 1, then the state of the variables remains the same.***
