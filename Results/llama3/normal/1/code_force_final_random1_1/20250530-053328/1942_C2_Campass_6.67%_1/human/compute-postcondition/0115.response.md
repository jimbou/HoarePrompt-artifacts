Postcondition: **`t` is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `sx` is the sum of all `c` values where `c` is equal to 1 plus the first element in the list plus the second element in the list, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing the values `c` where even numbers come first and must have at least 3 elements, `cons` is the minimum of `n` - 2 and `x` + `sx` - 2, `i` is the next element in the `val` list, `c` is equal to a quarter of the next element in the `val` list, `y` is the first element in the list minus half of the first element in the list minus half of the next element in the `val` list, and `stdin` contains -1 test cases. If `y` is less than `c`, then `sx` is updated to include twice the value of `y`.**
