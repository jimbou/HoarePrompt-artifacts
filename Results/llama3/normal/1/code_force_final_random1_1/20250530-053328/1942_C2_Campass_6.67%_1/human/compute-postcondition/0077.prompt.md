Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, `sx` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `l` is 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in `l` minus 1, where even numbers come first, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, `cons` is not printed, `i` is `x`.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is 0, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input, y is an integer from the input minus c, sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus 2 times y if y is less than c, otherwise sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus 2 times y plus i, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in l minus 1, where even numbers come first and must have at least 1 element, c is half of the first element in the list val, i is the first element in the list val, stdin contains -1 test cases, cons is not printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is 0, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input, y is an integer from the input minus 2 times c, sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus 3 times y plus i if y is less than c, otherwise sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus 5 times y plus i, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in l minus 1, where even numbers come first and must have at least 2 elements, c is a quarter of the first element in the list val, i is the second element in the list val, stdin contains -1 test cases, cons is not printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is 0, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input, y is an integer from the input minus 2 times the third element in the list val divided by 2 minus half of the third element in the list val, sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus 3 times y plus the third element in the list val plus the third element in the list val if y is less than the third element in the list val divided by 2, otherwise sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus 5 times y plus the third element in the list val plus the third element in the list val, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in l minus 1, where even numbers come first and must have at least 3 elements, c is half of the third element in the list val, i is the third element in the list val, stdin contains -1 test cases, cons is not printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
