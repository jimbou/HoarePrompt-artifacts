Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer, x is an integer and is at least 1, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least 1 c which is l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1 for i from 1 to x, where even numbers come first in ascending order and odd numbers come next in ascending order, stdin contains t-2 test cases, sx is the sum of all c which are 1 plus 2 times y if y is less than c, otherwise sx is the sum of all c which are 1, plus i, i is the first element in val, c is half of the first element in val, y is y minus c.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `l`, `val`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `sx` is updated by adding `i` to it, where `i` is the first element in `val`. The value of `y` is also updated by subtracting `c` from it, where `c` is half of the first element in `val`.
