Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer, x is an integer and is at least 1, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements, where even numbers come first in ascending order and odd numbers come next in ascending order, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is the second element in val, c is half of the second element in val, sx is the sum of all c which are 1 plus 2 times y, plus i, and y is y minus c.**

In this output state, the value of sx has been incremented by i, and the value of y has been decremented by c. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
