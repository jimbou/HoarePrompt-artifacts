Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and must be at least 1, `y` is an integer from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is an empty list, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, `cons` is not printed, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` minus 1 is 1, then `sx` is 1. Otherwise, `sx` is 0.***
