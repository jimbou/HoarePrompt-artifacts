Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer and is at least 1, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers with `n +` the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing at least 1 `c` which is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x`, where even numbers come first in ascending order and odd numbers come next in ascending order, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `sx` is the sum of all `c` which are 1, `i` is the first element in `val`, `c` is half of the first element in `val`. The current value of `y` is less than `c`.**
