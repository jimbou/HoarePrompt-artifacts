Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input, y is an integer from the input minus c, sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus 4 times y if y is less than c, otherwise sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus 4 times y plus i, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in l minus 1, where even numbers come first and must have at least 2 elements, c is a quarter of the first element in the list val, i is the second element in the list val, stdin contains -1 test cases, cons is not printed.**

The code snippet modifies the value of `sx` by adding `y * 2` to it. Since `sx` was initially the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `l` is 1 plus 2 times `y` if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise `sx` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `l` is 1 plus 2 times `y` plus `i`, the new value of `sx` becomes the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `l` is 1 plus 4 times `y` if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise `sx` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `l` is 1 plus 4 times `y` plus `i`. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. All other variables remain unchanged.
