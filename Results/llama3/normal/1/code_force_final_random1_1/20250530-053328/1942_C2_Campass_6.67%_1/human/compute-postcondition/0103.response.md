Postcondition: **`t` is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is an integer from the input minus the sum of half of each element in the list `val`, `sx` is the sum of all `c` values where `c` is equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing the values `c` where even numbers come first and must have at least 1 element, `cons` is the minimum of `n` - 2 and `x` + `sx` - 2, `i` is the first element in the list, `c` is half of the first element in the list, and stdin contains -1 test cases, and the value of `cons` is printed. The current value of `y` is less than the current value of `c`.**
