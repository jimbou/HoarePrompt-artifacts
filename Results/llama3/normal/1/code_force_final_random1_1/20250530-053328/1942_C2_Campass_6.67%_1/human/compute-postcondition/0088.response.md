Output State: **`t` is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and is greater than 0, `y` is an integer from the input minus the sum of half of each element in the list `val`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing the value `c`, `cons` is the minimum of `n` - 2 and `x` + `sx` - 2, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, and the value of `cons` is printed, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` minus 1 is 1, then `sx` is 1. Otherwise, `sx` remains 0.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been appended to the list `val`, which was previously empty. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being one less than its original value, `n` and `x` still being integers from the input, `y` still being an integer from the input minus the sum of half of each element in the list `val`, `l` still being a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `cons` still being the minimum of `n` - 2 and `x` + `sx` - 2, `stdin` still containing -1 test cases, and the value of `cons` still being printed, and `i` still being 1. The value of `sx` remains dependent on the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` minus 1.
