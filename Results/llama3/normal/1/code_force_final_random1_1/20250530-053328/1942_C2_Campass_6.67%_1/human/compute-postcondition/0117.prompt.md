Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is an integer from the input minus the sum of half of each element in the list `val`, `sx` is the sum of all `c` values where `c` is equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing the values `c` where even numbers come first, `cons` is the minimum of `n` - 2 and `x` + `sx` - 2, `i` is equal to `x`, and stdin contains -1 test cases, and the value of `cons` is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, sx is the sum of all c values where c is equal to 1 plus the first element in the list, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the values c where even numbers come first and must have at least 1 element, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, i is the first element in the list, c is half of the first element in the list, y is the first element in the list minus half of the first element in the list, and stdin contains -1 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, sx is the sum of all c values where c is equal to 1 plus the first element in the list plus the second element in the list, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the values c where even numbers come first and must have at least 2 elements, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, i is the second element in the list, c is equal to half of the second element in the list, y is the first element in the list minus half of the first element in the list minus half of the second element in the list, and stdin contains -1 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, sx is the sum of all c values where c is equal to 1 plus the first element in the list plus the second element in the list plus i, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the values c where even numbers come first and must have at least 3 elements, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, i is the next element in the val list, c is equal to a quarter of the next element in the val list, y is the first element in the list minus half of the first element in the list minus half of the next element in the val list minus c, and stdin contains -1 test cases. If y is less than c, then sx is updated to include twice the value of y.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
