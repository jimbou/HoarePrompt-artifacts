Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a list containing c which is l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1 for i from 1 to x, stdin contains t-2 test cases, sx is the sum of all c which are 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` remains an integer, `x` remains an integer, `y` remains an integer, `l` remains a sorted list of integers with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` becomes a list containing `c` which is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` from 1 to `x`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, and `sx` becomes the sum of all `c` which are 1.
