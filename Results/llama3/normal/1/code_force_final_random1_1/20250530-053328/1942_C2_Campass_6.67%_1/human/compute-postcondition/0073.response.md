Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input, y is an integer from the input minus 2 times the third element in the list val divided by 2, sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus 3 times y plus the third element in the list val if y is less than the third element in the list val divided by 2, otherwise sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1 plus 5 times y plus the third element in the list val, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements in l minus 1, where even numbers come first and must have at least 3 elements, c is half of the third element in the list val, i is the third element in the list val, stdin contains -1 test cases, cons is not printed.**

In this output state, the value of c has been updated to be half of the third element in the list val, which is i. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
