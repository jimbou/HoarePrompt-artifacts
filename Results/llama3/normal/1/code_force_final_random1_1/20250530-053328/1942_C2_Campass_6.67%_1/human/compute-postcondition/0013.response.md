Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing `l[1] - l[0] - 1` and `l[2] - l[1] - 1`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 2, `c` is `l[2] - l[1] - 1`, `sx` is 1 if `l[2] - l[1] - 1` is 1, otherwise `sx` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still 1 less than its original value and is greater than 0. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The list `l` is still a sorted list of integers with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end. The list `val` now contains two elements: `l[1] - l[0] - 1` and `l[2] - l[1] - 1`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still `t-2`. The value of `i` is still 2. The value of `c` is still `l[2] - l[1] - 1`. The value of `sx` is still 1 if `l[2] - l[1] - 1` is 1, otherwise it is 1.
