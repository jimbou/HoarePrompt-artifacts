The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is y minus the sum of all c in val, l is a sorted list of integers with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing c which is l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1 for i from 1 to x, where even numbers come first in ascending order and odd numbers come next in ascending order, sx is the sum of all c which are 1 plus 2 times y if y is less than c, otherwise sx is the sum of all c which are 1, plus the sum of all i in val, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, stdin contains 0 test cases, and cons is printed, cons (where cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2)**
