Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing c which is l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1 for i from 1 to x, where even numbers come first in ascending order and odd numbers come next in ascending order, stdin contains t-2 test cases, sx is the sum of all c which are 1
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer, x is an integer and is at least 1, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least 1 c which is l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1 for i from 1 to x, where even numbers come first in ascending order and odd numbers come next in ascending order, stdin contains t-2 test cases, sx is the sum of all c which are 1 plus 2 times y if y is less than c, otherwise sx is the sum of all c which are 1, plus i, i is the first element in val, c is half of the first element in val, y is y minus c.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer, x is an integer and is at least 1, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of integers with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements, where even numbers come first in ascending order and odd numbers come next in ascending order, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is the second element in val, c is half of the second element in val, sx is the sum of all c which are 1 plus 2 times y, plus i, and y is y minus c.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, n is an integer, x is an integer and is at least 1, y is an integer and is decreased by c, l is a sorted list of integers with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements, where even numbers come first in ascending order and odd numbers come next in ascending order, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is the third element in val, c is half of the third element in val, and sx is the sum of all c which are 1 plus 2 times y, plus i, and increased by i and 2 times y if y is less than c.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
