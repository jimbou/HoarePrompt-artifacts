This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the list consecutive, considering the given constraints (x, y), and prints this value for each test case. The function iterates through all test cases, processing each one independently, and outputs the result for each case.
