Postcondition: ***t is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, sx is the sum of all c values where c is equal to 1 plus the first element in the list, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the values c where even numbers come first and must have at least 2 elements, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, i is the second element in the list, c is equal to half of the second element in the list, y is the first element in the list minus half of the first element in the list, and stdin contains -1 test cases. If y is less than c, sx is updated to the sum of all c values where c is equal to 1 plus the first element in the list plus twice the first element in the list minus half of the first element in the list.***
