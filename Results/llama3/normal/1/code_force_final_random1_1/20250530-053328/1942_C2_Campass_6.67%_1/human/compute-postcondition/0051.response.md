Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and must be at least 2, `y` is an integer from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, `cons` is not printed, `i` is 2, `sx` is either 1 or 2**

The value of `sx` is incremented by 1. Since `sx` was either 0 or 1, it is now either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
