Output State: **t is not equal to 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, sx is the sum of all c values where c is equal to 1 plus the first element in the list, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the values c where even numbers come first and must have at least 1 element, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, i is the first element in the list, c is half of the first element in the list, y is the first element in the list minus half of the first element in the list, and stdin contains -1 test cases.**

The code modifies the values of sx and y. The first line adds the first element in the list to sx, and the second line subtracts half of the first element in the list from y. No other variables are affected.
