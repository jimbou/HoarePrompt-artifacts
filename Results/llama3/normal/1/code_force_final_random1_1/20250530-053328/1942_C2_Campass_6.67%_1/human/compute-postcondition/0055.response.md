Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and must be at least 3, `y` is an integer from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` and `c`, `c` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, `cons` is not printed, `i` is 3, if `c` is 1, `sx` is either 1 or 2, otherwise `sx` is either 0 or 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still greater than 0 but has been decreased by 1, `n`, `x`, `y`, `l`, `stdin`, `cons`, `i` and `sx` are still the same as before. The only change is that `c` is now assigned the value of `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, which is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted list `l`, minus 1.
