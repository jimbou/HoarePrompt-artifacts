Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and must be at least 2, `y` is an integer from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` and `c`, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, `cons` is not printed, `i` is 2, if `c` is 1, `sx` is either 1 or 2, otherwise `sx` is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `val` has been updated to include the value of `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `val` now contains the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `l`, minus 1, and the value of `c`.
