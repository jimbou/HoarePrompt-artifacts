Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is 1, `c` is `l[1] - l[0] - 1`. If `c` is 1, then `sx` is 1. Otherwise, `sx` remains 0.***
