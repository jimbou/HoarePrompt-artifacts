Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, t is 1 less than its original value.**

Explanation: The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map object. Then, it reads the first line from stdin, which contains a single integer `t`, and assigns it to the variable `t`. The value of `t` is reduced by 1, as the first test case has been read. The remaining `t-1` test cases are still in stdin, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
