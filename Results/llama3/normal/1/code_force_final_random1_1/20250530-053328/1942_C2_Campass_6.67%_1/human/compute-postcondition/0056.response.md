Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and must be at least 3, `y` is an integer from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` and `c`, `c` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, `cons` is not printed, `i` is 3, if `c` is 1, `sx` is either 2 or 3, otherwise `sx` is either 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `sx` has been incremented by 1. If `c` is 1, `sx` was either 1 or 2, so now it is either 2 or 3. If `c` is not 1, `sx` was either 0 or 1, so now it is either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
