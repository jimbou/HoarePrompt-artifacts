Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, n is an integer from the input, x is an integer from the input, y is an integer from the input, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of integers from the input with n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, val is an empty list, stdin contains -1 test cases, and cons is not printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    if c == 1:
        sx += 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and must be at least 1, `y` is an integer from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing `c`, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, `cons` is not printed, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` minus 1 is 1, then `sx` is 1. Otherwise, `sx` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and must be at least 2, `y` is an integer from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` and `c`, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, `cons` is not printed, `i` is 2, if `c` is 1, `sx` is either 1 or 2, otherwise `sx` is either 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input and must be at least 3, `y` is an integer from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` and `c` and `c`, `c` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, `stdin` contains -1 test cases, `cons` is not printed, `i` is 3. If `c` is 1, `sx` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `sx` is either 0 or 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
