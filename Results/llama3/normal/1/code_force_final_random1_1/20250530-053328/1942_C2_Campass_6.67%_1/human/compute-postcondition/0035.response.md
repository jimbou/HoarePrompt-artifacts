Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer and is at least 1, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers with `n` + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements, where even numbers come first in ascending order and odd numbers come next in ascending order, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is the third element in `val`, `c` is half of the third element in `val`, and `sx` is the sum of all `c` which are 1 plus 2 times `y`, plus `i`. If `y` is less than `c`, then `sx` is increased by 2 times `y` and `y` is decreased by `c`.***
