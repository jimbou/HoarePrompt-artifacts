Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer and is at least 1, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers with `n + the first element of the original list appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements, where even numbers come first in ascending order and odd numbers come next in ascending order, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `sx` is the sum of all `c` which are 1 plus 2 times `y` if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise `sx` is the sum of all `c` which are 1, plus `i`, `i` is the second element in `val`, `c` is half of the second element in `val`, `y` is `y` minus `c`**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated to be half of the second element in `val`, which is `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
