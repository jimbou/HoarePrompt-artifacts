Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n), and the second list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that all a_i's are pairwise different. If k is 14, x is the 14th element of the second list in a. If the current value of c is 2 and the current value of a[i] is greater than x, then the current value of ind is a list containing the value i, the current value of c is equal to the number of elements in the list a that are greater than x, and the current value of i is equal to the number of elements in the list a that are greater than x minus 1. Otherwise, the state of ind, c, and i remains unchanged. The list ind containing the indices of elements in the second list of a that are greater than the 14th element x of the second list in a is printed. If k is not 14, the state of ind, c, and i remains unchanged. ind is not an empty list and contains more than one element. The first element of ind is not 0. The value of k is greater than the second element of ind.***
