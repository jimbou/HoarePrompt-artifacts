The code prints the list `ind` containing the indices of elements in the second list of `a` that are greater than the 14th element `x` of the second list in `a`. The list `ind` contains the indices of the elements in the second list of `a` that are greater than `x`, and the number of elements in `ind` is equal to the number of elements in the second list of `a` that are greater than `x`. The value of `c` is equal to the number of elements in the second list of `a` that are greater than `x`, and the value of `i` is equal to the number of elements in the second list of `a` that are greater than `x` minus 1.
Output: **a is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n), and the second list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that all a_i's are pairwise different. The current value of k is 14. x is the 14th element of the second list in a. If the current value of c is 2 and the current value of a[i] is greater than x, then the current value of ind is a list containing the value i, the current value of c is equal to the number of elements in the list a that are greater than x, and the current value of i is equal to the number of elements in the list a that are greater than x minus 1. Otherwise, the state of ind, c, and i remains unchanged. The list ind containing the indices of elements in the second list of a that are greater than the 14th element x of the second list in a is printed**
