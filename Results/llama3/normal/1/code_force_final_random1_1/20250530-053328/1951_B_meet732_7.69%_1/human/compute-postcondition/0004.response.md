Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n), and the second list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that all a_i's are pairwise different, x is the kth element of the second list in a, if the current value of a[i] is greater than x, then ind is a list containing the value i, c is 1, and i is 0. Otherwise, the state of ind, c, and i remains unchanged.***
