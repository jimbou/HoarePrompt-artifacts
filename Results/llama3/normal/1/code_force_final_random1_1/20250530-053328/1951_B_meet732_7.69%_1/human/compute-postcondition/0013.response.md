The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^5, 1 <= `k` <= `n`), and the second list contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9) such that all `a_i`'s are pairwise different, `x` is the `k`th element of the second list in `a`. If the current value of `c` is 2 and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `ind` is a list containing the value `i`, `c` is 3, and `i` is 2. Otherwise, the state of `ind`, `c`, and `i` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
