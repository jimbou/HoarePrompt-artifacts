Output State: **a is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n), and the second list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that all a_i's are pairwise different, x is the kth element of the second list in a, ind is an empty list, c is 0.**

The code snippet assigns the kth element of the second list in `a` to `x`, initializes an empty list `ind`, and sets `c` to 0. The values of `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The pairwise difference of all elements in the second list of `a` is also preserved since no elements are added, removed, or modified.
