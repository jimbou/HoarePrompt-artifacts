Output State: **`a` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^5, 1 <= `k` <= `n`), and the second list contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9) such that all `a_i`'s are pairwise different, `x` is the `k`th element of the second list in `a`. If the current value of `c` is 2 and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `ind` is a list containing the value `i`, `c` is 3, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `ind`, `c`, and `i` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `a`, `x`, `ind`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged, but we have exited the loop or if statement that this `break` statement was a part of.
