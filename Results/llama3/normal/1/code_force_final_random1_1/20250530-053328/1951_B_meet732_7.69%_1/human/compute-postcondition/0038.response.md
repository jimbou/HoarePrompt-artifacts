Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the difference of the first element of the list ind and 1, and the difference of k and the first element of the list ind. The first element of the list ind is the index of the first element in the second list of a that is greater than the 14th element x of the second list in a, and k is the second element of the first list in a. The value of k is less than or equal to the second element of the list ind.**

Note: Since k is less than or equal to ind[1], the maximum value will always be ind[0] - 1.
