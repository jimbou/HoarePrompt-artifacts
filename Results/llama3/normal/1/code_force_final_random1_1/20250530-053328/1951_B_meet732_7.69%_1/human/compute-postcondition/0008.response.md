The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^5, 1 <= `k` <= `n`), and the second list contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9) such that all `a_i`'s are pairwise different, `x` is the `k`th element of the second list in `a`. If the current value of `c` is 2 and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then the current value of `ind` is a list containing the value `i`, and the current value of `i` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `ind`, `c`, and `i` remains unchanged. If the current value of `c` is not 2, then the state of `ind`, `c`, and `i` remains unchanged.**
