Output State: **a is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n), and the second list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that all a_i's are pairwise different, x is the kth element of the second list in a, ind is a list containing the value i, c is 3, and i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `x` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `ind` is updated to include the value `i` because the current value of `c` is 2 and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`. The value of `c` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
