Output State: **The program returns the minimum value between the second element of the list 'ind' minus 1 and 'k' minus 1. 'k' is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, and the second element of the list 'ind' is an integer greater than or equal to 0.**

In this output state, the program returns the minimum value between two integers. The first integer is the second element of the list 'ind' minus 1, where 'ind' is a list containing the indices of elements in the second list of 'a' that are greater than the 14th element 'x' of the second list in 'a'. The second integer is 'k' minus 1, where 'k' is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive.
