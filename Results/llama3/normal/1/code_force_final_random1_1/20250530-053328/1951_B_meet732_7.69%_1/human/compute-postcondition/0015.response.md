Output State: **a is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n), and the second list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that all a_i's are pairwise different, x is the kth element of the second list in a, ind is a list containing the value i, c is 4, and i is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `x` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The list `ind` now contains the value `i` because the first line of the code appends `i` to `ind`. The value of `c` is incremented by 1 due to the second line of the code, making it 4. The value of `i` remains 2 as it is not modified by the code.
