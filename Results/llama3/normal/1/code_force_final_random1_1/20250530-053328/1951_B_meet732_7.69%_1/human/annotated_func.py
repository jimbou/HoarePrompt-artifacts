#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list 'a' containing two lists as input. The first list contains two integers 'n' and 'k', and the second list contains 'n' unique integers. The function finds the indices of elements in the second list that are greater than the 'k'th element. If no such elements are found, it returns 'n-1'. If one such element is found, it returns 'k-1' if the index of the element is 0, otherwise it returns the minimum of 'k-1' and the index of the element minus 1. If two such elements are found, it returns the maximum of the index of the first element minus 1 and the difference between the indices of the two elements if 'k' is greater than the index of the second element, otherwise it returns the maximum of the index of the first element minus 1 and 'k' minus the index of the first element. If 'k' is 14, it also prints the indices of elements greater than the 14th element.
