Output State: **`a` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= `n` <= 10^5, 1 <= `k` <= `n`), and the second list contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9) such that all `a_i`'s are pairwise different, `x` is the `k`th element of the second list in `a`. The current value of `c` is 2. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then the current value of `ind` is a list containing the value `i`, and the current value of `i` is 0. Otherwise, the state of `ind`, `c`, and `i` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `x`, `c`, `ind`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the conditions on `a`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are still valid.
