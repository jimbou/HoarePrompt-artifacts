The code prints the difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted list `a`. The last element of the list `a` is the largest number in the list, and the first element of the list `a` is the smallest number in the list. Since the list `a` contains integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the list will be a non-negative integer.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the list a**
