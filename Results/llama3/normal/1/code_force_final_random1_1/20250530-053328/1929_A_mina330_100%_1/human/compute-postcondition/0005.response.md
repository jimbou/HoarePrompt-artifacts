The only variable in the loop head is itest, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable itest. If itest is less than ntest, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, itest is 1, ntest is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, itest must be increased by 1, so itest is 2, and for the loop to execute again ntest must be greater than 1.
State: **`ntest` is an integer between 2 and 499 (inclusive), `itest` is 2, `stdin` contains `ntest` test cases, each test case consisting of an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and the difference between the last and first element of the list `a` is being printed**
