Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this sum, the elements should be arranged in ascending order, so that the largest element is subtracted from the smallest element, resulting in the maximum possible difference.

The provided program correctly implements this approach. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then sorts the array in ascending order using the `sort()` method and calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements using `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`. This difference is printed as the maximum beauty of the array.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing each test case and printing the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
