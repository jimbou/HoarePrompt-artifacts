The code prints the difference between the last and first element of the list `a`, which is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).

Since `a` is a sorted list, the last element `a[len(a) - 1]` is the maximum value in the list, and the first element `a[0]` is the minimum value in the list.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`.

Output: **the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list a**
