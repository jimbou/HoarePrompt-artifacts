Output State: **ntest is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), itest is 2, stdin contains ntest - 1 test cases, each test case consisting of an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), n is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and the difference between the last and first element of the list a is being printed**

The code snippet reads an integer `n` from `stdin` and assigns it to the variable `n`. It then reads `n` integers from `stdin`, splits them into a list, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The list `a` is then sorted in ascending order. The difference between the last and first element of the list `a` is being printed. 

Since `ntest` is an integer between 2 and 499 (inclusive), after reading one test case, `ntest` will be an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive). The number of test cases in `stdin` will also decrease by 1. The value of `itest` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` is sorted and its elements are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The difference between the last and first element of the list `a` is being printed.
