The code prints the difference between the last and first element of the list `a`.
The list `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), where `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
The last element of the list `a` is the maximum value in the list, and the first element of the list `a` is the minimum value in the list.
Therefore, the difference between the last and first element of the list `a` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list.
Output: **the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list a**
