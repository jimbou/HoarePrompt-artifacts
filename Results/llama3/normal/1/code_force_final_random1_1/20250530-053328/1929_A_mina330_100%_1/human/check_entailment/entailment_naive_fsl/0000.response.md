Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. However, the program only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array, which is not the correct calculation.

For example, consider the input [1, 2, 3, 4]. The program will output 3, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. However, the correct calculation of the beauty of the array is (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) + (4 - 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. But if we rearrange the array to [1, 3, 2, 4] the beauty will be (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) + (4 - 2) = 2 - 1 + 2 = 3. So the maximum beauty is 3 but the program does not consider all the possible permutations of the array.

A correct solution would involve sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
