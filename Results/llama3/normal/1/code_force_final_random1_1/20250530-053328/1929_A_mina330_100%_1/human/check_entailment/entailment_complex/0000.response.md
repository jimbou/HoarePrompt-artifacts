Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order and prints the difference between the largest and smallest integer in each test case.

The program's logic is correct because the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by arranging the elements in ascending order. This is because the beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and the largest difference will always be between the largest and smallest elements.

The program's implementation is also correct. It correctly reads the input, sorts the integers, and prints the difference between the largest and smallest integer in each test case.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
