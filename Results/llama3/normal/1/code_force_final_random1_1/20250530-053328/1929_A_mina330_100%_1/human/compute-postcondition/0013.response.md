Output State: **ntest is 0, itest is equal to the initial value of ntest, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and the difference between the last and first element of the list a which is a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ntest` has been decremented to 0, the variable `itest` has reached the initial value of `ntest`, the standard input `stdin` is empty (i.e., it contains 0 test cases), the variable `n` still holds an integer value between 2 and 100 (inclusive), the list `a` is still sorted and contains integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and the difference between the last and first element of the list `a` has been printed.
