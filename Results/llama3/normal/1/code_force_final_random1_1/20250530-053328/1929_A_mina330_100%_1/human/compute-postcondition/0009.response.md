To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `itest` and `ntest`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `itest` is less than `ntest`. At the end of the previous iteration, `itest` is 2, and `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `itest` must be incremented by 1, so `itest` becomes 3. The value of `ntest` remains the same.

State: **`ntest` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `itest` is 3, `stdin` contains `ntest` - 2 test cases, each test case consisting of an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and the difference between the last and first element of the list `a` which is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` is being printed**
