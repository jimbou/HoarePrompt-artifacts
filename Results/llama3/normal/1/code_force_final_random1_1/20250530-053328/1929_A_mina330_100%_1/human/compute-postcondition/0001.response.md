To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `itest` and `ntest`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `itest` is less than `ntest`. Since `ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), we can adjust the state of `ntest` to be at least 1, and `itest` to be 0 (since it starts from 0).

State: **`ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `itest` is 0, stdin contains `ntest` test cases, each test case consisting of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**
