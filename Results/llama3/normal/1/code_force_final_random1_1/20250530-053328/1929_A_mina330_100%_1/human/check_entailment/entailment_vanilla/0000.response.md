Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the difference between the last element and the first element.

3. However, this approach is incorrect because it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, whereas the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between all consecutive elements.

4. To find the maximum beauty, we need to consider the differences between all consecutive elements, not just the maximum and minimum elements.

5. A correct approach would be to sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

6. The given program does not correctly implement this approach and therefore produces incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
