Postcondition: ***idx is n+2*q+n+2*q+n+7, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-7], q must be greater than 2, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is 0, a[2] is 0, ..., a[n] is the integer value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-7], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is 0, pf[2] is 0, ..., pf[n] is the integer value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-7] XOR pf[n-1], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0 and key pf[i] mapped to either an empty list or a list containing i and i, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t minus two, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and an empty string and either 'YES' or 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO'. If it1 is less than the length of v1, it2 is greater than or equal to 0, v1[it1] is less than or equal to r, and v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l, then results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and 'YES'. If it1 is greater than or equal to the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or (v1[it1] is greater than r) or (v2[it2] is less than l), results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and 'NO'. If pf[i] is not in mp, then mp[pf[i]] now contains i and i.***
