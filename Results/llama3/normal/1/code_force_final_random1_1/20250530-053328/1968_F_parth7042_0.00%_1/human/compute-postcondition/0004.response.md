Output State: **idx is 4, n is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2] and must be greater than 0, q is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-1], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `a[i]` has been set to the value of `data[idx]`. The value of `pf[i]` has been set to the XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
