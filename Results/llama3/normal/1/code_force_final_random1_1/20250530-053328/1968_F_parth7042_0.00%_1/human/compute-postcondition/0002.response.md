Output State: **idx is 3, n is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2], q is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], a is a list of n+1 zeros, pf is a list of n+1 zeros, mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r.**

The code executes the following operations:

1. `n = int(data[idx])`: Assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to `n`. Since `idx` is 1, `n` becomes the value of `data[1]`.

2. `q = int(data[idx + 1])`: Assigns the integer value of `data[idx + 1]` to `q`. Since `idx` is 1, `q` becomes the value of `data[2]`.

3. `idx += 2`: Increments `idx` by 2, making `idx` equal to 3.

4. `a = [0] * (n + 1)`: Creates a list `a` of `n + 1` zeros.

5. `pf = [0] * (n + 1)`: Creates a list `pf` of `n + 1` zeros.

6. `mp = {(0): [0]}`: Creates a dictionary `mp` with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0.

The final state includes the updated values of `idx`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp`, as well as the unchanged values of `t`, `results`, and `_`. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing `t-1` test cases.
