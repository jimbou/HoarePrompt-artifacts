Output State: **idx is n+2*q+1, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-2*q], q is an integer equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-2*q], a[2] is the value of data[idx-2*q], ..., a[n] is the value of data[idx-2*q], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-2*q], pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], ..., pf[n] is the value of pf[n-1] XOR a[n], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, ..., key pf[n] mapped to a list containing n, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and an empty string, _ is q-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r] in mp, v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1] in mp, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one.**

The code appends an empty string to the results list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
