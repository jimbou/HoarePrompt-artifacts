Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: idx is n+2*q+n+2*q+3, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-1], q is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is 0, a[2] is 0, ..., a[n] is 0, pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is 0, pf[2] is 0, ..., pf[n] is 0, mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t minus one, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and an empty string and 'NO', _ is q-1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q+1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r] in mp, v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1] in mp, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n is greater than 0, and pf[i] is in mp, and mp[pf[i]] contains i, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q+1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]. If x is 0, then the current value of x is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made. The current value of it1 is less than the length of v1, the current value of it2 is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of v1 at index it1 is less than or equal to r, and the current value of v2 at index it2 is greater than or equal to l, results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop. If it1 is greater than or equal to the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or (v1[it1] is greater than r) or (v2[it2] is less than l), results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and 'NO'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

If x is 0, then the current value of x is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made. The current value of it1 is less than the length of v1, the current value of it2 is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of v1 at index it1 is less than or equal to r, and the current value of v2 at index it2 is greater than or equal to l, results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop. If it1 is greater than or equal to the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or (v1[it1] is greater than r) or (v2[it2] is less than l), results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and 'NO'.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
