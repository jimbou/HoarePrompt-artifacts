Output State: **idx is n+2*q+n+2*q+n+2*q+1, q is 0, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and an empty string and either 'YES' or 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' and ... and either 'YES' or 'NO', _ is q.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: The index `idx` has moved `2*q` positions forward, the number of queries `q` has been exhausted (i.e., it is now 0), and the results list contains the outcome of each query. If a query had `x` equal to 0, the corresponding result is 'YES'. Otherwise, the result is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on the conditions checked in the loop body. The other variables, such as `n`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `t`, `stdin`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2`, remain unchanged.
