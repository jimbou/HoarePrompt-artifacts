Output State: idx is n+2*q+n+2*q+n+2*q+1, q is 0, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and an empty string and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and either 'YES' or 'NO', _ is q.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the index 'idx' has moved forward by 2*q, the number of queries 'q' has been exhausted (i.e., it is now 0), and the results list contains 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise it contains 'YES' followed by either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop. The variable '_' is also equal to q, which is now 0.
