Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: idx is n+3, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-2], q is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-1], a[2] is the value of data[idx-1], ..., a[n] is the value of data[idx-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-1], pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], ..., pf[n] is the value of pf[n-1] XOR a[n], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, ..., key pf[n] mapped to a list containing n, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *idx is n+5, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-4], q is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-3], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-3], a[2] is the value of data[idx-3], ..., a[n] is the value of data[idx-3], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-3], pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], ..., pf[n] is the value of pf[n-1] XOR a[n], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, ..., key pf[n] mapped to a list containing n, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and 'YES' if the current value of it1 is less than the length of v1, the current value of it2 is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of v1[it1] is less than or equal to r, and the current value of v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'NO', _ is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases if x is 0, otherwise stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r] in mp, v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1] in mp, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *idx is n+7, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-6], q is an integer greater than 1 and equal to the value of data[idx-5], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-5], a[2] is the value of data[idx-5], ..., a[n] is the value of data[idx-5], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-5], pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], ..., pf[n] is the value of pf[n-1] XOR a[n], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, ..., key pf[n] mapped to a list containing n, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO', _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases if x is 0, otherwise stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r] in mp, v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1] in mp, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one. The value of results depends on whether the current value of it1 is less than the length of v1, the current value of it2 is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of v1[it1] is less than or equal to r, and the current value of v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l. If all these conditions are met, results is a list containing 'YES' and 'YES'. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *idx is n+9, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-10], q is an integer greater than 2 and equal to the value of data[idx-9], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-9], a[2] is the value of data[idx-9], ..., a[n] is the value of data[idx-9], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-9], pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], ..., pf[n] is the value of pf[n-1] XOR a[n], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, ..., key pf[n] mapped to a list containing n, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO', _ is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases if x is 0, otherwise stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-4], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-3], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r] in mp, v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1] in mp, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one. If it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l), then results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' and 'YES'. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' and 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
