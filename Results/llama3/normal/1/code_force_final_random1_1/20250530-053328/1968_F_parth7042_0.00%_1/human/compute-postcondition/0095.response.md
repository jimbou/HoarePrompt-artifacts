Output State: **idx is n+2*q+n+2*q+1, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-1], q is an integer equal to 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q], a[2] is the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q+1], ..., a[n] is the value of data[idx-q-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q], pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], ..., pf[n] is the value of pf[n-1] XOR a[n], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0 and key pf[i] mapped to a list containing indices of pf[i] including i, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t minus one, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and an empty string, _ is q-1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q+1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r] in mp, v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1] in mp, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n is greater than 0, and pf[i] is in mp, and mp[pf[i]] contains i, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q+1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]. If x is 0, then the current value of x is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made. The current value of it1 is less than the length of v1, the current value of it2 is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of v1 at index it1 is less than or equal to r, and the current value of v2 at index it2 is greater than or equal to l, results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop. If it1 is greater than or equal to the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or (v1[it1] is greater than r) or (v2[it2] is less than l), results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and 'NO'.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of `idx` has been incremented by `2*q`, `q` has been decremented to 0, and the values of `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `t`, `results`, `_`, `stdin`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` have been updated based on the loop's execution. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
