Output State: **idx is n+2*q+1, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-2*q], q is an integer equal to 0, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-2*q], a[2] is the value of data[idx-2*q], ..., a[n] is the value of data[idx-2*q], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-2*q], pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], ..., pf[n] is the value of pf[n-1] XOR a[n], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, ..., key pf[n] mapped to a list containing n, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, _ is q-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r] in mp, v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1] in mp, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is characterized by the following changes:

*   The value of `idx` is incremented by `2*q+1`, where `q` is the number of iterations.
*   The value of `q` is set to `0`, indicating that all iterations have been completed.
*   The value of `_` is set to `q-1`, which is the last iteration index.
*   The `results` list contains the outcome of each iteration, which is either `'YES'` if `x` is `0`, or `'YES'` and either `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on the conditions met in the loop body.
*   The values of `n`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, `t`, `stdin`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.

In summary, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations reflects the completion of all iterations, with the `results` list containing the outcome of each iteration and the other variables remaining unchanged.
