Postcondition: **idx is 4, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-2], q is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-1], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is 1. The current value of pf[i] is not in mp.**
