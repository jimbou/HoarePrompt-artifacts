Output State: **idx is n+2*q+n+2*q+n+3, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-3], q must be greater than 0, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is 0, a[2] is 0, ..., a[n] is the integer value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-3], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is 0, pf[2] is 0, ..., pf[n] is the integer value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-3] XOR pf[n-1], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0 and key pf[i] mapped to either an empty list or a list containing i and i, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t minus one, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and an empty string and 'NO', _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-2], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r] in mp, v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1] in mp, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n is greater than 0, and pf[i] is either in mp or not in mp, and mp either contains pf[i] or does not contain pf[i], l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-2], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]. The current value of x is 0.**

The code block consists of two lines: `results.append('YES')` and `continue`. The first line appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`. The second line, `continue`, skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves on to the next iteration.

Since the current value of `x` is 0, the `results` list will contain 'YES' after the execution of the code. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
