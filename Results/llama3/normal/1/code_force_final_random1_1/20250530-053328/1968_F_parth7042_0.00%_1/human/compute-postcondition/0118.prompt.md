You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: idx is n+2*q+n+2*q+n+1, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-1], q is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is 0, a[2] is 0, ..., a[n] is the integer value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is 0, pf[2] is 0, ..., pf[n] is the integer value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q-1] XOR pf[n-1], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0 and key pf[i] mapped to either an empty list or a list containing i and i, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t minus one, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and an empty string and 'NO', _ is q-1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q+1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r] in mp, v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1] in mp, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n is greater than 0, and pf[i] is either in mp or not in mp, and mp either contains pf[i] or does not contain pf[i], l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-2*q+1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]. If x is 0, then the current value of x is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made. The current value of it1 is less than the length of v1, the current value of it2 is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of v1 at index it1 is less than or equal to r, and the current value of v2 at index it2 is greater than or equal to l, results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop. If it1 is greater than or equal to the length of v1, or it2 is less than 0, or (v1[it1] is greater than r) or (v2[it2] is less than l), results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and 'NO'. If pf[i] is not in mp, then mp[pf[i]] now contains i and i.
```
for _ in range(q):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
