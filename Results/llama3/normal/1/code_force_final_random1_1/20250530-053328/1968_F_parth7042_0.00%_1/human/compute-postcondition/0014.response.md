The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **idx is 5, n is an integer greater than 2 and equal to the value of data[idx-2], q is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-1] and a[2] is the value of data[idx-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-1] and pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, and if pf[i] is not in mp, then key pf[i] mapped to an empty list, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is 3**
