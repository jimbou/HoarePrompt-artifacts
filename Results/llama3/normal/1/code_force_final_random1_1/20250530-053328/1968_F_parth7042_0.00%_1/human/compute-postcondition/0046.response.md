Postcondition: ***idx is n+9, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-10], q is an integer greater than 2 and equal to the value of data[idx-9], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-9], a[2] is the value of data[idx-9], ..., a[n] is the value of data[idx-9], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-9], pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], ..., pf[n] is the value of pf[n-1] XOR a[n], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, ..., key pf[n] mapped to a list containing n, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO', _ is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases if x is 0, otherwise stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-4], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-3], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r] in mp, v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1] in mp, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one. If it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l), then results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' and 'YES'. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' and 'NO'.***
