Based on the initial state, let's break down the variables and objects involved:

* `idx` is calculated as `n+2*q+n+2*q+...+n+2*q+t` times, but since `q` is 0, `idx` simplifies to `n+n+...+n+t` times, which is essentially `n` repeated `t` times.
* `q` is 0.
* `results` is a list containing:
	+ 'YES' if `x` is 0 (initially).
	+ For each iteration of the loop, either 'YES' or 'NO' is appended to the list, followed by an empty string.
	+ This pattern repeats, with the last iteration appending either 'YES' or 'NO' and an empty string.

Now, let's analyze the `print` statement:

`print('\n'.join(results))`

The `join()` method concatenates the elements of the `results` list into a single string, using the newline character (`\n`) as the separator.

Given the structure of the `results` list, the output will be a series of lines, where each line contains either 'YES' or 'NO', followed by an empty line (due to the empty string appended after each iteration).

Since `x` is not explicitly defined, we can't determine the exact initial value of the `results` list. However, based on the loop's behavior, we can describe the output as:

Output: **A series of lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO', separated by empty lines, with the initial line containing 'YES' if x is 0, and the subsequent lines following the pattern of either 'YES' or 'NO' and an empty line, repeated for t iterations**
