Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: idx is 3, n is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2], q is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], a is a list of n+1 zeros, pf is a list of n+1 zeros, mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: idx is 4, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-2], q is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-1], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0 and if pf[i] is not in mp, then key pf[1] is mapped to a list containing 1, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is 1 and mp[pf[1]] is appended with 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: idx is 5, n is an integer greater than 1 and equal to the value of data[idx-2], q is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-1] and a[2] is the value of data[idx-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-1] and pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, and if pf[i] is not in mp, then key pf[i] mapped to an empty list, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: idx is 6, n is an integer greater than 2 and equal to the value of data[4], q is an integer equal to the value of data[5], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[5], a[2] is the value of data[5], and a[3] is the value of data[5], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[5], pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], and pf[3] is the value of pf[2] XOR a[3], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, and if pf[i] is not in mp, then key pf[i] mapped to an empty list, otherwise key pf[3] mapped to a list containing 3, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
