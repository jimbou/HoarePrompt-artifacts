The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **idx is 4, n is an integer greater than 1 and equal to the value of data[idx-2], q is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-1], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0 and if pf[i] is not in mp, then key pf[1] is mapped to a list containing 1, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is 2 and mp[pf[1]] is appended with 1.**
