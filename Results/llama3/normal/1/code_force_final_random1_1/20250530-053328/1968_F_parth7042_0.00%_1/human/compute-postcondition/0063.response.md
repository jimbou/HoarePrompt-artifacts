Explanation:
The code block consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of data[idx] to a[i], effectively updating the value of a[3] since i is 3. The second line increments idx by 1, changing its value to n+2*q+5. The third line updates pf[i] by XORing pf[i-1] with a[i], resulting in pf[3] being the XOR of pf[2] and a[3]. No other variables are affected by the code block.
