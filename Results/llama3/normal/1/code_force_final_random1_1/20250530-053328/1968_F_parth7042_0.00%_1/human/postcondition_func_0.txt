This function reads input from standard input, processes it according to a specific format, and prints the results. It expects the input to contain a number of test cases, each consisting of two integers (n and q), a list of n integers, and q queries, each containing two integers (l and r). The function then performs a series of operations on the input data, including XOR operations, prefix sum calculations, and binary searches. Based on the results of these operations, it appends either 'YES' or 'NO' to a list of results, which is then printed to standard output, separated by empty lines. The function effectively determines whether a given query can be satisfied based on the input data and prints the corresponding result.
