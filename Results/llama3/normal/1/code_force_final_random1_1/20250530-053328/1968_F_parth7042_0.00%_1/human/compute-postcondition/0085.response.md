Output State: **idx is n+2*q+n+5, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-5], q is an integer greater than 1 and equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-4], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-2*q-n-4], a[2] is the value of data[idx-2*q-n-3], ..., a[n] is the value of data[idx-4], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-2*q-n-4], pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], ..., pf[n] is the value of pf[n-1] XOR a[n], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0 and key pf[i] mapped to a list containing indices of pf[i] including i, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t minus one, results is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO', _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-4], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-3], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r] in mp, v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1] in mp, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n is greater than 0, and pf[i] is in mp, and mp[pf[i]] contains i, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-4], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-3], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `results` now contains 'YES' and 'NO' instead of just 'YES'. This is because the code `results.append('NO')` adds 'NO' to the end of the `results` list. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
