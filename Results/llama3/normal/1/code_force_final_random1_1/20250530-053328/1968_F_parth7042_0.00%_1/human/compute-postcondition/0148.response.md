Output State: **idx is n+2*q+n+2*q+...+n+2*q+t times, q is 0, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and an empty string and either 'YES' or 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' and ... and either 'YES' or 'NO' and an empty string, _ is q.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

* The value of `idx` will be the sum of `n+2*q` for each test case, plus `t` times, where `t` is the original value of `t`.
* The value of `q` will be 0.
* The value of `results` will be a list containing 'YES' if `x` is 0, otherwise it will contain 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, followed by an empty string. This pattern will repeat for each test case.
* The value of `_` will be `q-1`, which is 0 since `q` is 0.

In summary, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations will have `idx` incremented by the total number of elements in all test cases, `q` set to 0, and `results` containing the results of all queries in the format described above.
