Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, t is an integer equal to the original value of t, idx is 1, results is an empty list**

The code reads the first test case from stdin, which contains the number of test cases t. The value of t is assigned to the variable t. The index idx is incremented by 1 to point to the next test case. The results list is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected.
