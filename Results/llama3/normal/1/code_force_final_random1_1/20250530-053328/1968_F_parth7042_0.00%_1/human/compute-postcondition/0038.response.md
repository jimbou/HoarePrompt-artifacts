Postcondition: ***idx is n+7, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-6], q is an integer greater than 1 and equal to the value of data[idx-5], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-5], a[2] is the value of data[idx-5], ..., a[n] is the value of data[idx-5], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-5], pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], ..., pf[n] is the value of pf[n-1] XOR a[n], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, ..., key pf[n] mapped to a list containing n, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO', _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases if x is 0, otherwise stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r] in mp, v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1] in mp, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one. The value of results depends on whether the current value of it1 is less than the length of v1, the current value of it2 is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of v1[it1] is less than or equal to r, and the current value of v2[it2] is greater than or equal to l. If all these conditions are met, results is a list containing 'YES' and 'YES'. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO'.***
