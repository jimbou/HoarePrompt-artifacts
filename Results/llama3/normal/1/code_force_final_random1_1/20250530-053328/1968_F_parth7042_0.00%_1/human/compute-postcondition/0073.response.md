The final state of the program is as follows:

*   `idx` remains unchanged at `n+2*q+n+3`.
*   `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of `data[idx-2*q-n-3]`.
*   `q` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of `data[idx-2*q-n-2]`.
*   `a` remains unchanged as a list of `n+1` integers where `a[1]` is the value of `data[idx-2*q-n-2]`, `a[2]` is the value of `data[idx-2*q-n-1]`, ..., `a[n]` is the value of `data[idx-3]`.
*   `pf` remains unchanged as a list of `n+1` integers where `pf[1]` is the value of `data[idx-2*q-n-2]`, `pf[2]` is the value of `pf[1]` XOR `a[2]`, ..., `pf[n]` is the value of `pf[n-1]` XOR `a[n]`.
*   `mp` remains unchanged as a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0 and key `pf[i]` mapped to a list containing indices of `pf[i]` including `i`.
*   `t` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of `t` minus one.
*   `results` remains unchanged as a list containing 'YES' if `x` is 0, otherwise `results` is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and an empty string.
*   `_` remains unchanged as 0.
*   `stdin` remains unchanged, containing `t-2` test cases, each test case containing two integers `n` and `q`, a list of `n` integers `a_1,\dots,a_n`, and `q` queries, each query containing two integers `l` and `r`.
*   `i` remains unchanged as `n`.
*   `l` remains unchanged as an integer equal to the value of `data[idx-2*q-n-2]`.
*   `r` remains unchanged as an integer equal to the value of `data[idx-2*q-n-1]`.
*   `x` remains unchanged as an integer equal to `pf[r]` XOR `pf[l-1]`.
*   `v1` is a new list containing indices of `pf[r]` in `mp`.
*   `v2` is a new list containing indices of `pf[l-1]` in `mp`.
*   `it1` is the insertion point for `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order.
*   `it2` is the insertion point for `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus one.
*   `n` is greater than 0, and `pf[i]` is in `mp`, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains `i`.
