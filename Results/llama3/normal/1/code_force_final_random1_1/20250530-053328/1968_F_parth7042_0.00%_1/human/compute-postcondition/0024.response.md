Postcondition: ***idx is n+5, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-4], q is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-3], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-3], a[2] is the value of data[idx-3], ..., a[n] is the value of data[idx-3], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-3], pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], ..., pf[n] is the value of pf[n-1] XOR a[n], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, ..., key pf[n] mapped to a list containing n, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases if x is 0, otherwise stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].***
