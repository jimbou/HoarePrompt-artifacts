Output State: **idx is 5, n is an integer greater than 1 and equal to the value of data[idx-2], q is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-1] and a[2] is the value of data[idx-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-1] and pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, and if pf[i] is not in mp, then key pf[i] mapped to an empty list, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: idx is still 5, n is still an integer greater than 1 and equal to the value of data[idx-2], q is still an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], a is still a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-1] and a[2] is the value of data[idx-1], pf is still a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-1] and pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, and if pf[i] is not in mp, then key pf[i] mapped to an empty list, t is still an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is still an empty list, _ is still 0, stdin still contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is still 2. The only change is that mp[pf[i]] now contains the value i, which is 2.
