Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given subarray is interesting or not. The program uses a prefix sum array `pf` to store the XOR of all elements up to each index, and a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each XOR value appears. The program then iterates over each query, calculates the XOR of the subarray, and checks if there are at least two occurrences of this XOR value in the `mp` dictionary that are within the range of the query. If such occurrences exist, the program appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. The program also handles the case where the XOR of the subarray is 0 separately, in which case it always appends 'YES' to the results list.

Correctness: **True**
