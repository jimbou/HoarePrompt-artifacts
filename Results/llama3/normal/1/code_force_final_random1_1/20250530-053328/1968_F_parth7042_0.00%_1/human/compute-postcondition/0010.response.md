Output State: **idx is 5, n is an integer greater than 1 and equal to the value of data[idx-2], q is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-1], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-1] and a[2] is the value of data[idx-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-1] and pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0 and key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1 and 1, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is 2.**

The code snippet executes the following operations:

1. Assigns the value of `data[idx]` to `a[i]`, where `i` is 2. This means `a[2]` now holds the value of `data[idx-1]`.

2. Increments `idx` by 1, making it 5.

3. Assigns the value of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` to `pf[i]`, where `i` is 2. This means `pf[2]` now holds the value of `pf[1]` XOR `a[2]`.

The values of `n`, `q`, `t`, `results`, `_`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The dictionary `mp` still contains the key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, and the key `pf[1]` mapped to a list containing 1 and 1.
