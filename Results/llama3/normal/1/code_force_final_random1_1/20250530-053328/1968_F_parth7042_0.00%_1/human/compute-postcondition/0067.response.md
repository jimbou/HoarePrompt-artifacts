Output State: **idx is n+2*q+n+1, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n-1], q is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[idx-2*q-n], a[2] is the value of data[idx-2*q-n+1], ..., a[n] is the value of data[idx-1], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[idx-2*q-n], pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], ..., pf[n] is the value of pf[n-1] XOR a[n], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0 and key pf[i] mapped to a list containing indices of pf[i] including i, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t minus one, results is a list containing 'YES' if x is 0, otherwise results is a list containing 'YES' and either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop and an empty string, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is n, l is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n], r is an integer equal to the value of data[idx-2*q-n+1], x is an integer equal to pf[r] XOR pf[l-1], v1 is a list containing indices of pf[r] in mp, v2 is a list containing indices of pf[l-1] in mp, it1 is the insertion point for l in v1 to maintain sorted order, it2 is the insertion point for r in v2 to maintain sorted order minus one, n is greater than 0, and pf[i] is in mp, and mp[pf[i]] contains i.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has processed all the elements in the list `a` and updated the prefix sum array `pf` and the dictionary `mp` accordingly. The value of `idx` has been incremented to point to the next element in the input data, and the value of `i` has been updated to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The other variables remain unchanged.
