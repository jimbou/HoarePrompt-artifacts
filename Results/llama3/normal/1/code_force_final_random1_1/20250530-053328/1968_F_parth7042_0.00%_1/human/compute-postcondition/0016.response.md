Output State: **idx is 6, n is an integer greater than 2 and equal to the value of data[4], q is an integer equal to the value of data[5], a is a list of n+1 integers where a[1] is the value of data[5], a[2] is the value of data[5], and a[3] is the value of data[5], pf is a list of n+1 integers where pf[1] is the value of data[5], pf[2] is the value of pf[1] XOR a[2], and pf[3] is the value of pf[2] XOR a[3], mp is a dictionary with key 0 mapped to a list containing 0, key pf[1] mapped to a list containing 1, 1 and 2, key pf[3] mapped to an empty list, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the original value of t, results is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains two integers n and q, a list of n integers a_1,\dots,a_n, and q queries, each query containing two integers l and r, i is 3**

The code updates the dictionary `mp` by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `pf[i]` (which is `pf[3]`) and the value is an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged.
