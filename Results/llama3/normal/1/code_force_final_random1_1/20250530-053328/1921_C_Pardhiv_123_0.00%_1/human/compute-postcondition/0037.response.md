The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and list  ls, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list ls.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, i is n - 1. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 2 elements and the i is 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of `a` * (`ls[j]` - `ls[j - 1]`) and `b` for all `j` from 1 to `n` - 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ls` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, stdin contains 0 inputs**
