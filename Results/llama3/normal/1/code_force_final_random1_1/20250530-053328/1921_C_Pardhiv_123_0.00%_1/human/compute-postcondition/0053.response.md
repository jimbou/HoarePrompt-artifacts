Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. For each test case, it calculates the minimum of a * (m_i - m_{i-1}) and b for all i from 1 to n-1, subtracts the sum of these values from f, and prints 'YES' if f is still greater than 0, otherwise prints 'NO'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.**
