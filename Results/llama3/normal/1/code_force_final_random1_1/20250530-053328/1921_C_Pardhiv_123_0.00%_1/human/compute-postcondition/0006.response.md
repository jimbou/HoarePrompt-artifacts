Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the minimum of `a * (ls[1] - ls[0])` and `b` minus the minimum of `a * (ls[2] - ls[1])` and `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ls` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[2] - ls[1])` and `b` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1.
