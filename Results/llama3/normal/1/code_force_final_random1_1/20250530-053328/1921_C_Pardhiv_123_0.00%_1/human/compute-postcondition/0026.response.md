Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, f is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of a * (ls[j] - ls[j - 1]) and b for all j from 1 to n - 1, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, ls is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, i is n - 1, t is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of `a` * (`ls[j]` - `ls[j - 1]`) and `b` for all `j` from 1 to `n - 1`, `a` and `b` remain integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ls` remains a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `i` is now `n - 1`, and `t` is still greater than 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2.
