The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time t needed to have been greater than 1 and t currently must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of `a` * (`ls[j]` - `ls[j - 1]`) and `b` for all `j` from 1 to `n - 1`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ls` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `i` is `n - 1`, `t` is greater than 1**
