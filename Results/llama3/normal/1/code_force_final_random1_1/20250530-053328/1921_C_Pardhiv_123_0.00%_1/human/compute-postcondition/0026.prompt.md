Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, f is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of a * (ls[j] - ls[j - 1]) and b for all j from 1 to n - 1, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, ls is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, i is n - 1, t is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(ls)):
    f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of `a` * (`ls[j]` - `ls[j - 1]`) and `b` for all `j` from 1 to `n - 1` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[1]` - `ls[0]`) and `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ls` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of `a` * (`ls[j]` - `ls[j - 1]`) and `b` for all `j` from 1 to `n - 1` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[1]` - `ls[0]`) and `b` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[2]` - `ls[1]`) and `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ls` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of `a` * (`ls[j]` - `ls[j - 1]`) and `b` for all `j` from 1 to `n - 1` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[1]` - `ls[0]`) and `b` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[2]` - `ls[1]`) and `b` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[3]` - `ls[2]`) and `b` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[3]` - `ls[2]`) and `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ls` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `t` is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
