Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, f is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of a * (ls[j] - ls[j - 1]) and b for all j from 1 to n - 1, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, ls is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `f` will be reduced by the sum of the minimum of `a * (ls[j] - ls[j - 1])` and `b` for all `j` from 1 to `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The loop will have iterated `n - 1` times, and the value of `i` will be `n - 1`.
