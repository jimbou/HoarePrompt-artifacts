Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, f is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of a * (ls[j] - ls[j - 1]) and b for all j from 1 to n - 1, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, ls is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, i is n - 1, t is greater than 1, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the values of n, f, a, b, ls, i, and t remain unchanged because the code does not modify them. The only change is that stdin now contains 0 inputs because the code reads two lines of input.
