According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `ls`. If `ls` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n - 1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `ls` must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of `a` * (`ls[j]` - `ls[j - 1]`) and `b` for all `j` from 1 to `n - 1`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ls` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2**
