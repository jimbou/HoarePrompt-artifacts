#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9). The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n (1 <= m_i <= 10^9, m_i < m_{i + 1}).
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, len(ls)):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, f is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of a * (ls[j] - ls[j - 1]) and b for all j from 1 to n - 1, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, ls is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, i is n - 1, stdin contains 0 inputs. If f > 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. For each test case, it calculates the minimum of a * (m_i - m_{i-1}) and b for all i from 1 to n-1, subtracts the sum of these values from f, and prints 'YES' if f is still greater than 0, otherwise prints 'NO'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
