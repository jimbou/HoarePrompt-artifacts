Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, f is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of a * (ls[j] - ls[j - 1]) and b for all j from 1 to n - 1, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, ls is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, i is n - 1, t is greater than 1, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `f` will be the initial value of `f` minus the sum of the minimum of `a` * (`ls[j]` - `ls[j - 1]`) and `b` for all `j` from 1 to `n` - 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
