According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0 minus 1, which means t is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, t must be greater than 1.

State: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, f is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of a * (ls[j] - ls[j - 1]) and b for all j from 1 to n - 1, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, ls is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2**
