The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and ls, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list ls.  If the list has at least 4 elements the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, ls has at least 3 elements, i is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and the i is 3.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the minimum of `a * (ls[1] - ls[0])` and `b` minus the minimum of `a * (ls[2] - ls[1])` and `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ls` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1**
