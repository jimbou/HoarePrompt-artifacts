Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9). The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n (1 <= m_i <= 10^9, m_i < m_{i + 1}).**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `t` has been assigned an integer value from the input, and the rest of the input remains unchanged, waiting to be processed. The input still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines with specific constraints on the values of the integers.
