Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone. It iterates through the list of message sending moments, calculates the minimum charge consumption between each pair of moments (either by keeping the phone on or turning it off and on), and subtracts this consumption from the initial phone charge. If the remaining charge is greater than 0 after processing all moments, it prints "YES", indicating that Stepan can send all messages. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* It correctly calculates the minimum charge consumption between each pair of moments, considering both the option of keeping the phone on and turning it off and on.
* It correctly updates the remaining phone charge after processing each moment.
* It correctly prints "YES" or "NO" based on the remaining phone charge after processing all moments.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
