Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the minimum of `a * (ls[1] - ls[0])` and `b` minus the minimum of `a * (ls[2] - ls[1])` and `b` minus the minimum of `a * (ls[3] - ls[2])` and `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ls` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[3] - ls[2])` and `b` from its previous value. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1.
