The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and ls, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and ls. If i is less than the length of ls the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 2, ls has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again ls must have at least 4 elements.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of `a` * (`ls[j]` - `ls[j - 1]`) and `b` for all `j` from 1 to `n - 1` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[1]` - `ls[0]`) and `b` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[2]` - `ls[1]`) and `b` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[3]` - `ls[2]`) and `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ls` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `t` is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2**
