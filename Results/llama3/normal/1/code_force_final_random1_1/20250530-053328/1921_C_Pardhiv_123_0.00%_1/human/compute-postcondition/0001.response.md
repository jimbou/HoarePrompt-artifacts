The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= f, a, b <= 10^9). The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n (1 <= m_i <= 10^9, m_i < m_{i + 1})**
