Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of `a` * (`ls[j]` - `ls[j - 1]`) and `b` for all `j` from 1 to `n - 1` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[1]` - `ls[0]`) and `b` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[2]` - `ls[1]`) and `b` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[3]` - `ls[2]`) and `b` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[3]` - `ls[2]`) and `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ls` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `t` is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a` * (`ls[3]` - `ls[2]`) and `b` from it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
