The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and ls, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list ls.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, ls has at least 2 elements, i is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `f` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of `a` * (`ls[j]` - `ls[j - 1]`) and `b` for all `j` from 1 to `n - 1` minus the minimum of `a` * (`ls[1]` - `ls[0]`) and `b`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `ls` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2**
