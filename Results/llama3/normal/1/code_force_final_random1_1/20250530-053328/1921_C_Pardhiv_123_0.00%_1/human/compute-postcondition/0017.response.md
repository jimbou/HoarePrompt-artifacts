Output State: **t is greater than 0 minus 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, f is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive minus the sum of the minimum of a * (ls[j] - ls[j - 1]) and b for all j from 1 to n - 1, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, ls is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2. If the current value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of t is decreased by 1, and all other variables remain the same. The stdin now contains one less test case. The condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of f remains the same.
