Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the parameters for each test case (n, f, a, b), and the message timestamps (m_1, m_2, ..., m_n).

2. The program correctly calculates the minimum energy consumption between each pair of consecutive messages. It chooses the minimum between the energy consumed by keeping the phone on (a * (m_i - m_{i-1})) and the energy consumed by turning the phone off and on (b).

3. The program correctly subtracts the total energy consumption from the initial phone charge (f).

4. The program correctly prints "YES" if the final phone charge is greater than 0, indicating that Stepan can send all messages, and "NO" otherwise.

5. The program correctly handles multiple test cases, iterating over each test case and resetting the variables as needed.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
