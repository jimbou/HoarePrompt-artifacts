You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, x, y, and r are lists of n integers, visited is a list of n boolean values, and coef is a list of n values that can be either 1 or -1.
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef` is a list of `n` None values, stdin contains no inputs
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `n` remains unchanged, `i` is now equal to `n`, and the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` are fully populated with integers from the input, while the lists `visited` and `coef` remain unchanged with all False values and None values, respectively.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: n is a non-negative integer, i is n, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n integers, tot is 0, bipartite is True, ok is True if there exists an i such that bipartite is True and tot is not 0, stdin contains no inputs
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *n is a non-negative integer, i is n, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n integers, tot is 0, bipartite is True, and either 'YES' is printed if there exists an i such that bipartite is True and tot is not 0, or 'NO' is printed if no such i exists.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: n is a non-negative integer, i is n, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n integers, tot is 0, bipartite is True, and ok is True because there exists an i such that bipartite is True and tot is not 0, stdin contains no inputs, and 'YES' is being printed

Case_2: n is a non-negative integer, i is n, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n integers, tot is 0, bipartite is True, ok is False, and 'NO' is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
