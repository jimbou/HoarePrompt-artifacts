Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a non-negative integer, i is n, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n False values, coef is a list of n None values, tot is 0, bipartite is True, ok is False, stdin contains no inputs
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer, i is less than n, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers. If the value at index i in the list visited is False, then the value at index i in the list visited is set to True, the value at index i in the list coef is set to 1, and ok is set to True if bipartite is True and tot is not 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer, i is less than n, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers. If the value at index i in the list visited is False, then the value at index i in the list visited is set to True, the value at index i in the list coef is set to 1, and ok is set to True if bipartite is True and tot is not 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `i` is one more than its previous value and still less than `n`, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers. If `visited[i]` is False, then `coef[i]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, and `ok` is `ok` or `bipartite` and `tot` is not 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
