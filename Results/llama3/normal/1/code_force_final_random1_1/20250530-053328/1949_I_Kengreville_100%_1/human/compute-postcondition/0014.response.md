The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **n is a positive integer, i is less than n, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers. If the value at index i in the list visited is False, then the value at index i in the list visited is set to True, the value at index i in the list coef is set to 1, and ok is set to True if bipartite is True and tot is not 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
