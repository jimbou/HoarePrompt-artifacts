Output State: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef` is a list of `n` None values, stdin contains no inputs

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `n` remains unchanged, `i` is now equal to `n`, and the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` are fully populated with integers from the input, while the lists `visited` and `coef` remain unchanged with all False values and None values, respectively.
