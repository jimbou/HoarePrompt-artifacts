Functionality: **This function determines whether a given graph is bipartite and contains a cycle with a non-zero total edge weight. It takes no arguments, but instead reads input from stdin, expecting a positive integer n followed by n lines, each containing three integers representing the x, y, and r values of an edge. The function then performs a depth-first search on the graph, checking for bipartiteness and non-zero total edge weight. If such a cycle is found, the function prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
