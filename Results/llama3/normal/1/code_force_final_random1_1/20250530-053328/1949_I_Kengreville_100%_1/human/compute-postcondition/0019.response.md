Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is one more than its previous value and still less than `n`, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers. If `visited[i]` is False, then `coef[i]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, and `ok` is `ok` or `bipartite` and `tot` is not 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
