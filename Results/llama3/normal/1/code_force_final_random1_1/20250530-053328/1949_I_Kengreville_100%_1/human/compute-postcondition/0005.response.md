The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of `n` values where the first element is an integer and the second element is an integer from the input, `y` is a list of `n` values where the first element is an integer and the second element is an integer from the input, `r` is a list of `n` values where the first element is an integer and the second element is an integer from the input, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef` is a list of `n` None values, stdin contains no inputs**
