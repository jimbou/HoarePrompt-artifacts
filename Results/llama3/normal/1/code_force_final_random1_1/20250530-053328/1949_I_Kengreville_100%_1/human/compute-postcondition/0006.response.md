Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is a list of `n` values where the first element is an integer, the second element is an integer from the input, and the third element is an integer from the input, `y` is a list of `n` values where the first element is an integer, the second element is an integer from the input, and the third element is an integer from the input, `r` is a list of `n` values where the first element is an integer, the second element is an integer from the input, and the third element is an integer from the input, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef` is a list of `n` None values, stdin contains no inputs**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `y`, and `r` have been updated to include the third element from the input, while the values of `n`, `i`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged. The stdin is empty as it has been used to provide the input values for `x`, `y`, and `r`.
