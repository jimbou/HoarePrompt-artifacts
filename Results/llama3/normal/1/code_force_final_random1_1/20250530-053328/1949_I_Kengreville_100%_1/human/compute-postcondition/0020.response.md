Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, i is n, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef is a list of n integers, tot is 0, bipartite is True, ok is True if there exists an i such that bipartite is True and tot is not 0, stdin contains no inputs**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged.
* The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements.
* The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged.
* The list `visited` now contains all `True` values, indicating that all elements have been visited.
* The list `coef` now contains integers, which were assigned during the loop iterations.
* The value of `tot` is 0, which is its initial value.
* The value of `bipartite` is still `True`, indicating that the graph is bipartite.
* The value of `ok` is `True` if there exists at least one iteration where `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0. Otherwise, it remains `False`.
* The input stream `stdin` still contains no inputs.
