Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is a list of `n` values where the first element is an integer and the second element is an integer from the input, `y` is a list of `n` values where the first element is an integer and the second element is an integer from the input, `r` is a list of `n` values where the first element is an integer and the second element is an integer from the input, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef` is a list of `n` None values, stdin contains no inputs**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `y`, and `r` have been updated to include the second element from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Since stdin contains no inputs initially, it remains empty after the execution of the code.
