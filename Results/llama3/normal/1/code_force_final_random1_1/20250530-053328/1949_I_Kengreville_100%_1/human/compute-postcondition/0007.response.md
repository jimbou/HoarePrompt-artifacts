Output State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is a list of `n` values where each element is an integer from the input, `y` is a list of `n` values where each element is an integer from the input, `r` is a list of `n` values where each element is an integer from the input, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef` is a list of `n` None values, stdin contains no inputs.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will be fully populated with integers from the input. The other variables, `visited` and `coef`, remain unchanged, with all elements being False and None, respectively.
