Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, i is n, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n False values, coef is a list of n None values, tot is 0, bipartite is True, ok is False, stdin contains no inputs**

The code initializes three new variables: `tot` is set to 0, `bipartite` is set to True, and `ok` is set to False. The values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty as there are no inputs.
