Output State: **n is a positive integer, i is less than n, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n values where the value at index i is True, coef is a list of n values where the value at index i is 1, tot is a non-negative integer, bipartite is True or False, ok is True if bipartite is True and tot is not 0, stdin contains no inputs.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The value of `i` is still less than `n`. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` retain their original values with `n` integers each. The `visited` list has its value at index `i` changed to True. The `coef` list has its value at index `i` set to 1. The value of `tot` is now a non-negative integer, which may have been updated during the execution of the `dfs` function. The value of `bipartite` is either True or False, depending on the outcome of the `dfs` function. The value of `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise it remains False. There are no inputs left in stdin.
