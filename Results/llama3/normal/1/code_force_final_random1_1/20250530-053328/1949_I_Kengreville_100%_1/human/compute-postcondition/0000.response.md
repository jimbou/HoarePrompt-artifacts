Output State: **n is an integer, x is a list of n None values, y is a list of n None values, r is a list of n None values, visited is a list of n False values, coef is a list of n None values, stdin contains no inputs**

The code block reinitializes the variables n, x, y, r, visited, and coef. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to n. Since stdin initially contains an integer, this line consumes the input, leaving stdin empty. The subsequent lines create lists of n elements, each initialized with None for x, y, and r, False for visited, and None for coef. The values of these variables are reset to their initial states, with n being the only variable retaining a specific value from the input.
