Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is less than `n`, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` values where the value at index `i` is False, `coef` is a list of `n` None values, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, `ok` is False, stdin contains no inputs. The current value of `visited[i]` is False.***
