The code accepts a space-separated list of three integers from the input and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]`, respectively. Since `i` is 0, the first elements of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` are updated. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is a list of `n` values where the first element is an integer, `y` is a list of `n` values where the first element is an integer, `r` is a list of `n` values where the first element is an integer, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef` is a list of `n` None values, stdin contains no inputs**
