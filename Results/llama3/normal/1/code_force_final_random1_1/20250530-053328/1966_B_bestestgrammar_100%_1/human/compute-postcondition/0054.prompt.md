Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, tc is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1. If the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then j is m - 1. If impossible is True, then ans is 'NO'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    gr.append(input())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 2, tc is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n+1 strings, i is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, tc is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 500, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n+2 strings, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 500, `m` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing n+3 strings, `i` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
