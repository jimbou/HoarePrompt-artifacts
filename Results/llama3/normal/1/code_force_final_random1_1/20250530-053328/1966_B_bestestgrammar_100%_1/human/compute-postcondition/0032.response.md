The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1-n test cases, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 500, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is 1, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, j is m - 1, if the first character of the string at index i in gr is equal to the first character of the string at index i + 1 in gr and the last character of the string at index i in gr is equal to the last character of the string at index i + 1 in gr, then impossible is True and ans is 'NO'. Otherwise, impossible is False.**
