Output State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is an empty list, i is n-1 if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, ans is 'YES' if the first character of the first string in gr is equal to the last character of the last string in gr, otherwise ans is 'NO', impossible is True if ans is 'NO', otherwise impossible is False.**

The code reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the standard input, which reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. It then initializes an empty list `gr`. The value of `i` is still `n-1` if the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, but since `gr` is empty, this condition is not applicable. The value of `ans` is 'YES' if the first character of the first string in `gr` is equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, but since `gr` is empty, this condition is also not applicable. Therefore, the value of `ans` is not changed. The value of `impossible` is still True if `ans` is 'NO', otherwise it is False.
