To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `tc`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `tc` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` is 0 and `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **t is at least 2, tc is 1, stdin contains t-2-n test cases, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1. If the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then j is m - 1. If impossible is True, then ans is 'NO'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the first character of the first string in gr is equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, and ans is printed**
