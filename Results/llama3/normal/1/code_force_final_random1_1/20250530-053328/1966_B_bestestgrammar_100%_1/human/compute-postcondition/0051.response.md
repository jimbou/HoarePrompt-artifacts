Output State: **t is at least 2, tc is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 500, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n+2 strings, i is 1**

In this output state, the value of `gr` has been updated to include one more string from the input, which was appended to the list using the `append` method. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-4 test cases, since one test case was consumed by the `input` function.
