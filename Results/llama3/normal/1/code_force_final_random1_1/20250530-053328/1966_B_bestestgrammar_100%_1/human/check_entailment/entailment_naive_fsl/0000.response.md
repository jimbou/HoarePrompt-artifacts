Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider a grid where the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, but there is a row or column of the same color that separates them. In this case, the program will incorrectly return 'NO' because it only checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color, and if they are not, it assumes that it is impossible to make all squares the same color.

For instance, consider the following grid:

```
WB
BW
```

In this case, the program will return 'NO', but it is actually possible to make all squares the same color by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners and coloring all squares in between them.

The program needs to be modified to handle such cases correctly.
