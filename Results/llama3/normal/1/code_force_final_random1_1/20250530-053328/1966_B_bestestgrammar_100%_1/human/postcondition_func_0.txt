The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of characters 'W' and 'B'. It then checks if it's possible to transform the top-left character of the grid into the bottom-right character by changing one character at a time, either horizontally or vertically, without changing the color of any two adjacent characters. The function prints 'YES' if such a transformation is possible and 'NO' otherwise.
