Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1-n test cases, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 500, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is 1, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, j is m - 1, impossible is False, ans is not assigned a value yet.**

In this output state, the value of the variable "impossible" has been updated to False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that "if the first character of the string at index i in gr is equal to the first character of the string at index i + 1 in gr and the last character of the string at index i in gr is equal to the last character of the string at index i + 1 in gr, then impossible is True and ans is 'NO'" is still valid, but since "impossible" is now False, the condition is not met, and "ans" is not assigned a value yet.
