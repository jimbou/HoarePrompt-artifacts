Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1-n test cases, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is 'YES', the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, and impossible is True.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the initial conditions remain the same, but a new variable "impossible" has been introduced and assigned the value True. The values of the other variables, such as t, tc, stdin, n, m, gr, i, and ans, remain unchanged.
