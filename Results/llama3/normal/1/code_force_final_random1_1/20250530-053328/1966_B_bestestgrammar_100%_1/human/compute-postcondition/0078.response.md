Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains `t-n-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing `2n` strings, `i` is 1, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES'. `impossible` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `impossible` has been updated to False, while all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
