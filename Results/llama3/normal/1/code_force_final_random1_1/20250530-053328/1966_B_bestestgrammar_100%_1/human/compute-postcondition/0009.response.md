Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1-n test cases, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains at least 1, `tc` remains 0, the number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by `n`, `n` becomes 0 (since the loop has finished executing), `m` remains unchanged, the list `gr` contains `n` strings (one for each iteration of the loop), and the variable `i` is set to `n-1` (since the loop iterates `n` times).
