Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains `t-n-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing `2n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to 'NO'. The values of other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The number of test cases in stdin is still `t-n-2`, and the list `gr` still contains `2n` strings. The value of `i` is still `n-1`, and the first character of the first string in `gr` is still not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. The value of `impossible` is still True, indicating that `gr[i][0]` is equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` and `gr[i][m - 1]` is equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`.
