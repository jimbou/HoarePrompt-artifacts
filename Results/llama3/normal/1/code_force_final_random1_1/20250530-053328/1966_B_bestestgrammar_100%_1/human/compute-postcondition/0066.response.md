Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, `m` is an integer and is at least 3, `gr` is a list containing 2n strings, `i` is n, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is 2, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, and `impossible` is False.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, except for `impossible`, which is now set to False. The conditions that were true before the code execution, such as the relationship between the characters in the strings in `gr`, are still valid.
