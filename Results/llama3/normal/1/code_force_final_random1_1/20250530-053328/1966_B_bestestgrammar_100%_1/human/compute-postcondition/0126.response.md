Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-n-3` test cases, `n` is at least 4, `m` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing at least 2 strings, `i` is at least 3, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `impossible` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `impossible` has been updated to False, regardless of the previous conditions. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial properties. The stdin still contains `t-n-3` test cases, and the list `gr` continues to hold at least 2 strings. The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `i`, and `ans` are preserved as specified in the initial state.
