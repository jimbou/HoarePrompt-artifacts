Output State: *t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1-n test cases, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, j is m - 1, impossible is False, and ans is 'NO'.


In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all the strings in the list gr, and the variable impossible is set to False, indicating that it is possible to find a pair of strings in gr where the first character of one string is equal to the first character of the next string and the last character of one string is equal to the last character of the next string. The variable ans is still set to 'NO', indicating that no such pair has been found yet.
