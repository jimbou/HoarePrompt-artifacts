Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 500, `m` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing n+3 strings, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `gr` has been updated to contain n+3 strings, as a new string has been appended to the list using the `input()` function. The stdin now contains t-5 test cases, as one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
