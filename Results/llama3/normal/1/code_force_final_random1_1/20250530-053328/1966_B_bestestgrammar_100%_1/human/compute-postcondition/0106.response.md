Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is 0, m is at least 2, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is 'YES', impossible is False if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the character at index m-1 of the last string in gr and the current value of gr[0][j] is not equal to gr[0][j + 1] or the current value of gr[n - 1][j] is not equal to gr[n - 1][j + 1]. Otherwise, impossible is True.***
