Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.

The program first checks if the top-left and bottom-right characters are different. If they are, it checks if there is a row or column where all characters are the same as the top-left character. If such a row or column exists, it means that it's impossible to change the color of the bottom-right character without changing the color of any two adjacent characters, so the program prints 'NO'.

If no such row or column exists, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the grid has only one row or one column, and it correctly handles the case where the top-left and bottom-right characters are the same.

Correctness: **True**
