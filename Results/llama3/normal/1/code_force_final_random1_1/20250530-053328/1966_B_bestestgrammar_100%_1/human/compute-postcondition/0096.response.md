Output State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-5 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing two strings, i is 1, ans is 'YES' if the first character of the string in gr is equal to the last character of the string in gr, otherwise ans is 'NO', impossible is True if ans is 'NO', otherwise impossible is False**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains at least 3, the value of tc remains 2, the number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, the values of n and m remain the same, the list gr now contains two strings, the value of i remains 1, and the values of ans and impossible remain dependent on the first and last characters of the string in gr.
