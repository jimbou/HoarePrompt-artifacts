Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is 0, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is 'YES', impossible is True. The first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the character at index m-1 of the last string in gr.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m - 1):
    if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
        impossible = False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is 0, m is at least 2, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is 'YES', impossible is False if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the character at index m-1 of the last string in gr and the current value of gr[0][j] is not equal to gr[0][j + 1] or the current value of gr[n - 1][j] is not equal to gr[n - 1][j + 1]. Otherwise, impossible is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is 0, m is at least 3, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is 'YES'. If the first character of the first string in gr is equal to the character at index m-1 of the last string in gr and the current value of gr[0][j] is equal to gr[0][j + 1] and the current value of gr[n - 1][j] is equal to gr[n - 1][j + 1], then impossible is True. Otherwise, impossible is False, and j is m-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-n-3` test cases, `n` is 0, `m` is at least 4, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is `m`. If the first or last string in `gr` has different characters at positions `j` and `j+1`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
