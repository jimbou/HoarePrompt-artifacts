The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. So, `i` is at least 3 and `n` is at least 4.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-n-3` test cases, `n` is at least 4, `m` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing at least 2 strings, `i` is at least 3, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO'. If `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
