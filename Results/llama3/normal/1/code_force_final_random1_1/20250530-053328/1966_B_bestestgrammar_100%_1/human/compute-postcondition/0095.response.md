To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 0, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 1. 

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop. 

The other variables, `t`, `tc`, `stdin`, `m`, `gr`, `ans`, and `impossible`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing one string, i is 1, ans is 'YES' if the first character of the string in gr is equal to the last character of the string in gr, otherwise ans is 'NO', impossible is True if ans is 'NO', otherwise impossible is False**
