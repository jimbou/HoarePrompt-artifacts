Output State: **t is 0, tc is t, stdin is empty, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the conditions described above, and impossible is either True or False depending on the conditions described above.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all iterations, and the loop variables have reached their final values. The value of `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The value of `tc` is equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that all iterations of the loop have been executed. The `stdin` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been read. The values of `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, and `impossible` are determined by the conditions described in the loop body, and their final values depend on the input data.
