Output State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is 0, m is at least 2, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is 'YES', impossible is False, j is 0, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the character at index m-1 of the last string in gr. Additionally, the current value of gr[0][j] is not equal to gr[0][j + 1] or the current value of gr[n - 1][j] is not equal to gr[n - 1][j + 1].**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the variable "impossible" has been changed to False. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The number of test cases, the number of strings, the list of strings, the indices, and the answer remain unchanged. The only change is that the variable "impossible" is now set to False.
