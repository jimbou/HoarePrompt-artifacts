Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1-n test cases, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 500, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is 1, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, j is m - 1. If the first character of the string at index i in gr is equal to the first character of the string at index i + 1 in gr and the last character of the string at index i in gr is equal to the last character of the string at index i + 1 in gr, then impossible is True and ans is 'NO'. Otherwise, impossible is False and ans is not assigned a value yet.***
