The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m - 2` (since `j` is `n-1` and `n` is `0`), and `m` is at least `2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is `m - 1`, and for the loop to execute again `m` must be at least 3.
State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is 0, m is at least 3, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is 'YES', impossible is False if the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the character at index m-1 of the last string in gr and the current value of gr[0][j] is not equal to gr[0][j + 1] or the current value of gr[n - 1][j] is not equal to gr[n - 1][j + 1]. Otherwise, impossible is True, j is m-1**
