Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing 2n strings, `i` is n, `ans` is 'YES'**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 'YES', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The input state still contains t-n-2 test cases, and the values of `n`, `m`, `gr`, and `i` are still within their specified ranges.
