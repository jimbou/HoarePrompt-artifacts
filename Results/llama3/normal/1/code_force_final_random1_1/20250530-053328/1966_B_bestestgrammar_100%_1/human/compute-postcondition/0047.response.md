Output State: **t is at least 2, tc is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1. If the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then j is m - 1. If impossible is True, then ans is 'NO'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

The code reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to n and m, and creates an empty list gr. This does not affect the values of t, tc, i, or any other variables. The state of the variables after the code executes remains the same as before, with the addition of the new values for n and m, and the creation of the empty list gr.
