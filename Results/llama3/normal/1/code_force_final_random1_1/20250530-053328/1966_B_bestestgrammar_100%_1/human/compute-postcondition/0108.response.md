Output State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is 0, m is at least 3, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is 'YES', impossible is False, j is m-1**

The code sets the value of `impossible` to `False`, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `impossible` is now always `False`, regardless of the conditions that previously determined its value.
