Output State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-7 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing three strings, i is 2, ans is 'YES' if the first character of the string in gr is equal to the last character of the string in gr, otherwise ans is 'NO', impossible is True if ans is 'NO', otherwise impossible is False**

In this output state, the value of `gr` has been updated to a list containing three strings, as a new string has been appended to it from the input. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1, from t-n-6 to t-n-7. All other variables remain unchanged.
