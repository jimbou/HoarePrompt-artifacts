The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive and n is greater than 0, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is an empty list, i is 0**
