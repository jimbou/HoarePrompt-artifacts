Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-n-3` test cases, `n` is 0, `m` is at least 4, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is `m`. If the first or last string in `gr` has different characters at positions `j` and `j+1`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
