To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for j in range(m - 1):`. The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1, so `j` becomes 1.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `tc`, `stdin`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, and `impossible`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing 2n strings, `i` is n, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is 1, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is True. Otherwise, `impossible` is False.**
