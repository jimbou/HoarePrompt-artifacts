Output State: **t is at least 2, tc is 1, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing 2n strings, i is n.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains at least 2, `tc` remains 1, and the number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by `n+2` (since `n` iterations were executed). The value of `n` remains unchanged, `m` also remains unchanged, and the list `gr` now contains `2n` strings (since `n` strings were appended in each iteration). The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
