Output State: `t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains `t-n-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing `2n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES'. If `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` is True.

The loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `i` has reached `n-1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body. The conditions for `ans` and `impossible` are still dependent on the values of `gr[0][j]`, `gr[0][j + 1]`, `gr[n - 1][j]`, `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, `gr[i][0]`, `gr[i + 1][0]`, `gr[i][m - 1]`, and `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`.
