Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1-n test cases, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, j is m - 1, impossible is True, and ans is 'NO'.**

In this output state, the value of the variable "impossible" has been changed to True, which in turn changes the value of the variable "ans" to 'NO'. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
