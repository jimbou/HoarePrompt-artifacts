The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **t is at least 2, tc is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is 0**
