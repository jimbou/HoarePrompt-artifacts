Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is an empty list**

The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from the first test case in stdin and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`, respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `tc` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The code then creates an empty list `gr`. The remaining test cases in stdin are not processed by this code snippet.
