Output State: **t is at least 2, tc is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n+1 strings, i is 0**

In this output state, the value of t, tc, n, m, and i remains the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains t-3 test cases because one test case has been consumed by the input() function. The list gr now contains n+1 strings because a new string has been appended to it from the input.
