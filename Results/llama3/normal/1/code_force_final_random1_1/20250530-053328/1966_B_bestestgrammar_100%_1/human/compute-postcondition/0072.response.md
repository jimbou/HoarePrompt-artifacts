Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing 2n strings, `i` is n, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that a new variable `impossible` has been introduced and assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
