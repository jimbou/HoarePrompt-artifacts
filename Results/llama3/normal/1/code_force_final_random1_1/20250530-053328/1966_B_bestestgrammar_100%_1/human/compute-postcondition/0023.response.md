Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1-n test cases, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is 'YES', the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, impossible is False, and j is m - 1.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `impossible` will be False, and the value of `j` will be `m - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
