Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1-n test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is 0, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, j is m - 1, impossible is False, and ans is 'NO'. The current value of i is such that either the first character of the string at index i in gr is not equal to the first character of the string at index i + 1 in gr, or the last character of the string at index i in gr is not equal to the last character of the string at index i + 1 in gr.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `impossible`, which is now set to `False`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
