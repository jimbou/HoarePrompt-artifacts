Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains `t-n-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing `2n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If `gr[i][0]` is equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` and `gr[i][m - 1]` is equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO' and `impossible` is True. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES' and `impossible` is False.***
