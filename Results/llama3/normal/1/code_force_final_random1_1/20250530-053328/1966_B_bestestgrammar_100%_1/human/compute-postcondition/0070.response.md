Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing 2n strings, `i` is n, `ans` is 'NO', `j` is m-1, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. The current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, making `impossible` True.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 'NO', while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `gr`, `i`, `j`, and the relationships between the characters in `gr` are still valid.
