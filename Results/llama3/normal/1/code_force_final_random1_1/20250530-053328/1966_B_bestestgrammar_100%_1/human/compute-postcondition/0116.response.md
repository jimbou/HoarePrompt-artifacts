Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is 0, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1. If there is at least one pair of adjacent characters in the first or last string of gr that are different, then ans is 'YES' and impossible is False. Otherwise, ans is 'NO' and impossible is True.***
