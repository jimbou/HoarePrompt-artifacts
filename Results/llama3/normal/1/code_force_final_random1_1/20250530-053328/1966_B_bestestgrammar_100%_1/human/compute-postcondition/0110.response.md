To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `m-1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `m`.

However, since `m` is at least 3, we can conclude that `m` is at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `tc`, `stdin`, `n`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, `impossible`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-n-3` test cases, `n` is 0, `m` is at least 4, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is `m`**
