Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1-n test cases, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, j is m - 1, impossible is False, and ans is not assigned a value yet.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for all variables except for `i` and `impossible`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and the variable `impossible` will be `False` because the loop will have checked all pairs of adjacent strings in the list `gr` and found at least one pair where the first character of the string at index `i` is not equal to the first character of the string at index `i + 1` or the last character of the string at index `i` is not equal to the last character of the string at index `i + 1`. The variable `ans` is not assigned a value yet because it is not modified inside the loop.
