Output State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is at least 1, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is either 'YES' or 'NO', impossible is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent strings in gr that do not have the same first or last character, otherwise impossible is True.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable `impossible` will be set to `False` if there exists at least one pair of adjacent strings in the list `gr` that do not have the same first or last character. Otherwise, `impossible` will remain `True`. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
