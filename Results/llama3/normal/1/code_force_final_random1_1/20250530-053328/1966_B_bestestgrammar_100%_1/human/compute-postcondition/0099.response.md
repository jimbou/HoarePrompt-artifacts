Output State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is 0, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is 'YES' if the first character of the first string in gr is equal to the last character of the last string in gr, otherwise ans is 'NO', impossible is True if ans is 'NO', otherwise impossible is False.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables affected by the loop head and body have reached their final values. The loop has appended n strings to the list gr, and the variable i has been updated to n-1. The variables ans and impossible have been updated based on the condition that the first character of the first string in gr is equal to the last character of the last string in gr. The other variables, t, tc, and m, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
