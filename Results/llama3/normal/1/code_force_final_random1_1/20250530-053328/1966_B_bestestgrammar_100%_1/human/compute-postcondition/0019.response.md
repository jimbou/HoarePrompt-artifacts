Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1-n test cases, `n` is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing n strings, `i` is n-1, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr. If the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is True and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `impossible` is False and `j` is 1.***
