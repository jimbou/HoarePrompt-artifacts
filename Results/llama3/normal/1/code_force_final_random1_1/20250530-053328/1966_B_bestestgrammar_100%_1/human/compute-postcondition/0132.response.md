Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is at least 0, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1. If there exists at least one pair of adjacent strings in gr that do not have the same first or last character, then ans is 'NO' and impossible is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
