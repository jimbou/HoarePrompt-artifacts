Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-n-3` test cases, `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing at least 2 strings, `i` is at least 2, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `impossible` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `impossible` has been updated to False, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions that were true in the initial state, such as `t` being at least 3, `n` being at least 3, and `m` being between 1 and 500 inclusive, are still true. The list `gr` still contains at least 2 strings, and `i` is still at least 2. The value of `ans` is still either 'YES' or 'NO'. The only change is that `impossible` is now False.
