According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is at least 2 and `j` is 0.
State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is 0, m is at least 2, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is 'YES', impossible is True, j is 0, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the character at index m-1 of the last string in gr.**
