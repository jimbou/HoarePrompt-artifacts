Based on the precondition, the value of `ans` depends on the conditions specified. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, then `i` is `n-1`. In this case, if `gr[i][0]` is equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` and `gr[i][m - 1]` is equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO' and `impossible` is True. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES' and `impossible` is False.

If the first character of the first string in `gr` is equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, then `ans` is 'YES'.

Therefore, the print statement will output either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on the conditions specified.

Output: **YES or NO (where YES indicates that the strings in gr can be arranged to form a cycle, and NO indicates that they cannot)**
