Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1-n test cases, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is 'YES'**

In this output state, the value of the variable 'ans' has been updated to 'YES', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable 't' is still at least 1, 'tc' is still 0, stdin still contains t-1-n test cases, 'n' is still an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, 'm' is still an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, 'gr' is still a list containing n strings, and 'i' is still n-1.
