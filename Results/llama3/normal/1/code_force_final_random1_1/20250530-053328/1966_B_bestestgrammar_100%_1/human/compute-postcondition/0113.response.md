Output State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is 0, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is 'YES', impossible is False if there is at least one pair of adjacent characters in the first or last string of gr that are different, otherwise impossible is True.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for all variables except `impossible`. The value of `impossible` will be `False` if there is at least one pair of adjacent characters in the first or last string of `gr` that are different. If all pairs of adjacent characters in the first and last strings of `gr` are the same, then `impossible` will be `True`.
