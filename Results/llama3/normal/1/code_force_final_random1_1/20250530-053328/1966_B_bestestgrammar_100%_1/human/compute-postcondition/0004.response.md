Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive and `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing one string, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `gr` has been updated to contain one string, which is the input from the first test case. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1, from t-1 to t-2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
