Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-n-3` test cases, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing at least 2 strings, `i` is at least 1, `impossible` is False, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO'. The current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values and conditions, except for `impossible`, which is now set to `False`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged, including the relationship between `gr[i][0]`, `gr[i + 1][0]`, `gr[i][m - 1]`, and `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`.
