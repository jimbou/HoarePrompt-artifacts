Output: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1-n test cases, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1. If the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then j is m - 1. If impossible is True, then ans is 'NO'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the first character of the first string in gr is equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, and ans is printed**
