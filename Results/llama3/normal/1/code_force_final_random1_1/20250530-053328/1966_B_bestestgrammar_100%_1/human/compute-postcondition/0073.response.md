The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains `t-n-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing `2n` strings, `i` is `n`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True. So for the loop to be executed `n` must be at least 2 and `i` is 0.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains `t-n-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing `2n` strings, `i` is 0, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True**
