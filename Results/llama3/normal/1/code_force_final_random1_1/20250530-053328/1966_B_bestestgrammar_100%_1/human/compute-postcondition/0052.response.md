The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 500. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is at least 2, tc is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, n is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 500, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n+2 strings, i is 2**
