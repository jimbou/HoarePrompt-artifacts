The only variables in the loop head are variable  j and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, `m` is an integer and is at least 3, `gr` is a list containing 2n strings, `i` is n, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is 2, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is True. Otherwise, `impossible` is False.**
