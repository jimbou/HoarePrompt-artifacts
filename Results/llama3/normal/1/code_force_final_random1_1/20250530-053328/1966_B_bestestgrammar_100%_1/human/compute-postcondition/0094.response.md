Output State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-4 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing one string, i is 0, ans is 'YES' if the first character of the string in gr is equal to the last character of the string in gr, otherwise ans is 'NO', impossible is True if ans is 'NO', otherwise impossible is False**

In this output state, the value of `gr` has been updated to contain one string, which is the input from the user. The value of `ans` and `impossible` are still dependent on the first and last characters of the string in `gr`. The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 1.
