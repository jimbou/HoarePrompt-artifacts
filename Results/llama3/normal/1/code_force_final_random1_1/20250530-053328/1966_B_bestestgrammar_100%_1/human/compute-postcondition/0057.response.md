Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing 2n strings, `i` is n, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True. The current value of the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the current value of the last character of the last string in `gr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `impossible` is set to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases `t` is still at least 2, and the current test case `tc` is still 1. The input stream `stdin` still contains `t-n-2` test cases. The values of `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, and `ans` are unchanged. Additionally, the first character of the first string in `gr` is still not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.
