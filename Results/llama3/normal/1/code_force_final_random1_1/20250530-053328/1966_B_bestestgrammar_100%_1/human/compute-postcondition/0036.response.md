Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1-n test cases, n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 500, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is 2, the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, j is m - 1, impossible is False, ans is not assigned a value yet.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `impossible` has been reset to `False`, while all other variables retain their previous values. The conditions on `t`, `tc`, `stdin`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `j`, and the relationship between the strings in `gr` are still valid. The variable `ans` remains unassigned.
