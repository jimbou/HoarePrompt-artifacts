Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing three strings, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains the same, at least 1. The value of `tc` also remains the same, 0. The stdin now contains t-4 test cases, since one test case has been consumed by the input() function. The value of `n` remains the same, an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, and greater than 1. The value of `m` also remains the same, an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. The list `gr` now contains three strings, since a new string has been appended to it from the input. The value of `i` remains the same, 2.
