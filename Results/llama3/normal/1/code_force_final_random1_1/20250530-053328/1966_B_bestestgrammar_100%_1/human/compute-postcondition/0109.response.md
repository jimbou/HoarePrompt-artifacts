Postcondition: ***t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is 0, m is at least 3, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, ans is 'YES'. If the first character of the first string in gr is equal to the character at index m-1 of the last string in gr and the current value of gr[0][j] is equal to gr[0][j + 1] and the current value of gr[n - 1][j] is equal to gr[n - 1][j + 1], then impossible is True. Otherwise, impossible is False, and j is m-1.***
