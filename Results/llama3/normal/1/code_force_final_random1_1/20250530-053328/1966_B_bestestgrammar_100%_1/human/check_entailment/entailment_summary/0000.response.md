Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly checks if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program first checks if the top-left and bottom-right characters are different. If they are, it checks if there are any horizontal or vertical lines that have the same color as the top-left character. If there are, it means that it's possible to transform the top-left character into the bottom-right character by changing one character at a time, either horizontally or vertically, without changing the color of any two adjacent characters. If there are no such lines, it means that it's impossible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

Correctness: **True**
