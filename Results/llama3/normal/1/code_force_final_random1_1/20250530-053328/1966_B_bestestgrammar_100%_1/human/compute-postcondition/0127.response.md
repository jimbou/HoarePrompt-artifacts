Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-n-3` test cases, `n` is at least 4, `m` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing at least 2 strings, `i` is at least 3, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO'. If `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.***
