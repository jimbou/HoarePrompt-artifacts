Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, `m` is an integer and is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing 2n strings, `i` is n, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True, `j` is 0, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. The current value of `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`.**
