Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 500) followed by `n` strings of length `m` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    gr = []
    for i in range(n):
        gr.append(input())
    ans = 'YES'
    if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
        impossible = True
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
        impossible = True
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, tc is 0, stdin contains t-1-n test cases, n is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1. If the first character of the first string in gr is not equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then j is m - 1. If impossible is True, then ans is 'NO'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the first character of the first string in gr is equal to the last character of the last string in gr, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains `t-n-2` test cases, `n` is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing `2n` strings, `i` is `n-1` if the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If `gr[i][0]` is equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` and `gr[i][m - 1]` is equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO' and `impossible` is True. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES' and `impossible` is False. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, then `ans` is 'YES'. The value of `ans` is being printed, which is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the conditions described above

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 3, tc is 2, stdin contains t-n-3 test cases, n is at least 0, m is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1. If there exists at least one pair of adjacent strings in gr that do not have the same first or last character, then ans is 'NO' and impossible is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and ans is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
