According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is 0, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2. Also, `i` is `n-1`, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-n-3` test cases, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing at least 2 strings, `i` is at least 1, `impossible` is True, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO'**
