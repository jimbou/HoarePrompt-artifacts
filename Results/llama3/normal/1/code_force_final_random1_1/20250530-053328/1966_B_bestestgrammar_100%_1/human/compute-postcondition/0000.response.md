The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 500) followed by `n` strings of length `m` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. After the code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer and stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 500) followed by `n` strings of length `m` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 500) followed by `n` strings of length `m` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'.**
