Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, stdin contains t-n-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 0 and 500 inclusive, `gr` is a list containing 2n strings, `i` is n, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is m-1, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If the current value of `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` is True.**

The loop will execute until `j` reaches `m-1`. At this point, `j` will be equal to `m-1`, and the value of `impossible` will depend on the values of `gr[0][j]`, `gr[0][j + 1]`, `gr[n - 1][j]`, and `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`. If any of these pairs of characters are not equal, `impossible` will be False. Otherwise, `impossible` will be True. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
