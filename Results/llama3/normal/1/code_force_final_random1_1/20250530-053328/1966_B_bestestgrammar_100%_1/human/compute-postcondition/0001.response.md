The only variable in the loop head is `tc` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1 and `tc` is now 0.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 500) followed by `n` strings of length `m` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'.**
