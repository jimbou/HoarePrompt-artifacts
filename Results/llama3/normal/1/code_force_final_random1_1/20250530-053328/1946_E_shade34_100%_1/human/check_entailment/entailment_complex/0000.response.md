Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations and their prefix/suffix maximums. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the number of suitable permutations.

`func_1` is a recursive function that calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number `b` modulo `1000000007`. It uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are then used to compute the modular inverse.

`func_2` uses the result of `func_1` to calculate the modular product of two numbers `a` and `b`. It returns the product of `a` and the modular inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007`.

The main program reads input data, which includes the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, the number of suffix maximums `m2`, and the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums. It then checks if the input data is valid (i.e., the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and the first prefix maximum is 1, and the last suffix maximum is `n`). If the input data is invalid, the program outputs 0.

If the input data is valid, the program calculates the number of suitable permutations using the `func_2` function. It iterates over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums, calculating the modular product of the number of permutations for each maximum. The final result is the product of all these modular products.

The program uses the `facts` array to store the factorial values modulo `1000000007`, which are used in the calculation of the modular products.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.
