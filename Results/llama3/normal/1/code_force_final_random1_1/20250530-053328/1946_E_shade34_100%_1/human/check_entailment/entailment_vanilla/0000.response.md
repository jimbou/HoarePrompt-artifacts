Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Function 1, `func_1(a, b)`, is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `b` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This function is used to handle the modular arithmetic required in the problem.

Function 2, `func_2(a, b)`, is used to calculate the modular multiplication of `a` and the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007`. This function is used to efficiently calculate the modular multiplication required in the problem.

The main part of the program is missing, but based on the provided functions, it is likely that the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions. The program would iterate through the prefix maximums and suffix maximums, using the modular arithmetic functions to calculate the number of permutations at each step.

Assuming the main part of the program is correctly implemented, the provided functions seem to be correct and efficient for solving the problem.

Correctness: **True**
