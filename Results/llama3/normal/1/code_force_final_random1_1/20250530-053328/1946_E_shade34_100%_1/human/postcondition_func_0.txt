This function calculates and returns two values based on the input integers a and b, where b is not equal to 0. If b is 0, it returns 1 and 0. If a is less than b, it calls another function func_1 with b and a as arguments and returns the swapped results. If a is a multiple of b, it returns 1 and the negation of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns the second result and the difference between the first result and the product of the integer division of a by b and the second result.
