Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of permutations that could have been guessed. The problem description requires the program to output the number of different permutations that could have been guessed, but the program does not provide a clear and correct way to calculate this number.

The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but it does not provide a clear explanation of how these functions are used to calculate the number of permutations. The functions seem to be related to modular arithmetic, but it is not clear how they are used to solve the problem.

Furthermore, the program does not provide any input or output examples to demonstrate how it works, making it difficult to understand how it is intended to be used.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to be modified to correctly calculate the number of permutations that could have been guessed, based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums. This would likely involve using a combination of mathematical formulas and algorithms to calculate the number of permutations.

For example, one possible approach to solving the problem would be to use the following steps:

1. Calculate the number of permutations that could have been guessed for the prefix maximums.
2. Calculate the number of permutations that could have been guessed for the suffix maximums.
3. Combine the results from steps 1 and 2 to calculate the total number of permutations that could have been guessed.

However, without a clear and correct implementation of these steps, the program is incorrect and does not provide a valid solution to the problem.
