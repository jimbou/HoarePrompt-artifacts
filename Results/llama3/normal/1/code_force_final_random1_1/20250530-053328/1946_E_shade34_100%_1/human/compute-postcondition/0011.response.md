Output State: **The program returns two values: `d` which is a returned value from `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c - a // b * d` which is the difference between `c` (a returned value from `func_1(b, a % b)`) and the product of `a // b` (integer division of `a` by `b`) and `d`.**

Note: Since `a` is not divisible by `b`, `a // b` will be the integer part of the division, and `a % b` will be the remainder. The values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1(b, a % b)`, which is not provided.
