#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0.
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The value 1 is an integer and 0 is also an integer and equals 0.
    #State: *a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: `d` and `c`, which are the returned values of `func_1(b, a)`, where `b` is an integer not equal to 0 and `a` is an integer less than `b`.
    #State: *a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, and a is not less than b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple containing two values: 1 and -(a // b - 1). The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negation of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, a // b is an integer, and a // b - 1 is also an integer. The negation of this integer is returned as the second value in the tuple.
    #State: *a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, a is not less than b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns two values: `d` which is a returned value from `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c - a // b * d` which is the difference between `c` (a returned value from `func_1(b, a % b)`) and the product of `a // b` (integer division of `a` by `b`) and `d`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns two values based on the input integers a and b, where b is not equal to 0. If b is 0, it returns 1 and 0. If a is less than b, it calls another function func_1 with b and a as arguments and returns the swapped results. If a is a multiple of b, it returns 1 and the negation of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns the second result and the difference between the first result and the product of the integer division of a by b and the second result.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the product of a non-negative integer `a` and the value `c` returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, modulo 1000000007.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input, calls another function `func_1` with `b` and a large prime number (1000000007) as arguments, and returns the product of `a` and the first value returned by `func_1`, modulo 1000000007. The function effectively computes a modular product involving the result of `func_1` and the input `a`, ensuring the result stays within a specific range due to the modulo operation.
