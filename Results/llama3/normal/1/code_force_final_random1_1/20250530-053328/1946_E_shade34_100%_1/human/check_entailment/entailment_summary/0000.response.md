Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations and modular arithmetic. It uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to perform calculations.

Function `func_1` calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number `b` modulo `1000000007`. This is a crucial step in the program, as it allows the program to perform modular arithmetic operations.

Function `func_2` uses the result of `func_1` to compute a modular product involving the input `a` and the result of `func_1`. This function is used to calculate the number of permutations that satisfy certain conditions.

The main program uses these two functions to solve the problem. It first checks if the input prefix and suffix maximums are valid. If they are not, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of permutations using the `func_2` function and prints the result modulo `1000000007`.

The program's logic is correct, and it uses the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly to perform the necessary calculations. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the program can handle large inputs without overflowing.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
