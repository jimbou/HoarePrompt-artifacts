Output State: **The program returns the product of a non-negative integer `a` and the value `c` returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, modulo 1000000007.**

In this output state, `a` is a non-negative integer, and `c` is the value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, where `b` is also a non-negative integer. The result is the product of `a` and `c`, taken modulo 1000000007.
