Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The code assigns the return values of `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to `c` and `d`, but since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. Therefore, we can only describe them as the values returned by the function call.
