This function takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input, calls another function `func_1` with `b` and a large prime number (1000000007) as arguments, and returns the product of `a` and the first value returned by `func_1`, modulo 1000000007. The function effectively computes a modular product involving the result of `func_1` and the input `a`, ensuring the result stays within a specific range due to the modulo operation.
