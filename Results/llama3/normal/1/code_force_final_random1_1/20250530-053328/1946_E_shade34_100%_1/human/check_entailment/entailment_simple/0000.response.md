Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations and their prefix/suffix maximums. The program first calculates the factorial of numbers up to 200002 and stores them in the `facts` list. It then iterates over each test case, reading the input values for the length of the permutation (`n`), the number of prefix maximums (`m1`), and the number of suffix maximums (`m2`), as well as the indices of the prefix maximums (`p`) and suffix maximums (`s`).

The program checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 0, indicating that there are no suitable permutations.

If the conditions are met, the program calculates the number of suitable permutations using the `func_2` function, which is based on the `func_1` function. The `func_1` function appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse of a number.

The `func_2` function uses the modular inverse to calculate the binomial coefficient `cnk`, which is then multiplied with the result of the previous iteration to calculate the total number of suitable permutations.

The program also calculates the number of permutations for the prefix and suffix maximums separately and multiplies them with the total number of suitable permutations.

Finally, the program prints the total number of suitable permutations modulo 1000000007.

Based on the provided problem description and the execution states of the program, the program appears to be correct. It correctly checks the conditions for the prefix and suffix maximums, calculates the number of suitable permutations using the `func_2` function, and prints the result modulo 1000000007.

Correctness: **True**
