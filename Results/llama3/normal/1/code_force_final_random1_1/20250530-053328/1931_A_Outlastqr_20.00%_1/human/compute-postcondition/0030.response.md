Based on the initial state, we can determine the value of `word` as follows:

* Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, we need to consider the three possible cases for `n`:
	+ If `n` is between 2 and 26, `word` is 'aa' followed by the `(n - 2)`th letter of the alphabet. Since `i` is 2, we can assume that `n` is 2, so `word` would be 'aa'.
	+ If `n` is larger than 26 but not greater than 52, `word` is a string consisting of 'a', a lowercase English letter between 'a' and 'z', and 'z'. Since `i` is 2, we can assume that `n` is 27, so `word` would be 'a' followed by the 1st letter of the alphabet (which is 'a') and 'z', resulting in 'aaz'.
	+ If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is a string consisting of the letter that is `(53 - n)` positions before 'z' in the alphabet, followed by the string 'zz'. Since `i` is 2, we can assume that `n` is 53, so `word` would be the letter that is 0 positions before 'z' (which is 'z') followed by 'zz', resulting in 'zzz'.

However, since `i` is 2, we can conclude that `n` is 2, and therefore `word` is 'aa'.

Output: **aa**
