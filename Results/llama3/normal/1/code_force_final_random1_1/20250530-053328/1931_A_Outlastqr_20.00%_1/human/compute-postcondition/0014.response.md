The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and input(). If `i` is less than input(), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, input() is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again input() must be greater than 1.
State: **stdin contains t-1 integers, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, input() is greater than 1, i is 1**
