The code `word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` appends the string 'a', the (n-28)th character of the alphabet, and 'z' to the word. The value of n is between 3 and 52 and is greater than 26, so n-28 is between -25 and 24 and is greater than -2. Since alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, the (n-28)th character of the alphabet is the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet, where 'a' is the 0th letter, 'b' is the 1st letter, and so on. Since n-28 is greater than -2, the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet is either 'a', 'b', or 'c'. Therefore, the word is now 'a' followed by either 'a', 'b', or 'c', followed by 'z'. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 integers, `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `input()` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 52 and is greater than 26, and `word` is either 'aaz', 'abz', or 'acz'.**
