Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly handles all possible cases for the encoded word. The program first checks if the encoded word is greater than 52, in which case it subtracts 53 from the encoded word and uses the resulting index to get the corresponding letter from the alphabet. It then appends 'zz' to the word.

If the encoded word is not greater than 52, but greater than 26, the program subtracts 28 from the encoded word and uses the resulting index to get the corresponding letter from the alphabet. It then appends 'az' to the word.

If the encoded word is not greater than 26, the program subtracts 3 from the encoded word and uses the resulting index to get the corresponding letter from the alphabet. It then appends 'aa' to the word.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded. The program also correctly handles the edge cases where the encoded word is 3, 26, or 52.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
