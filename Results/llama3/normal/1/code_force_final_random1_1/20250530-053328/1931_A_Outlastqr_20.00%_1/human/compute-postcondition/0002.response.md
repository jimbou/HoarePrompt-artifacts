Output State: **stdin contains t-1 integers n, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, input() is greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 78, word is an empty string**.

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is between 1 and 100, and `n` is between 3 and 78, `n` becomes an integer between 3 and 78. The second line initializes an empty string `word`. No other variables are affected.
