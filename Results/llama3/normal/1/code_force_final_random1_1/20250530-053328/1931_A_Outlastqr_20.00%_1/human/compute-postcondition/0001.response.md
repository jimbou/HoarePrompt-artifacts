The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and input(). If input() is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `input()` is greater than 0, i is 0**
