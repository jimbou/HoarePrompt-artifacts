Based on the precondition, we can analyze the possible values of `word` based on the value of `n`.

If `n` is between 2 and 26, `word` is 'aa' plus the `(n-2)`th letter of the alphabet. Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, the minimum value of `n` is 2. In this case, `word` would be 'aa' plus the 0th letter of the alphabet, which is 'a'. So, `word` would be 'aaa'.

If `n` is between 27 and 52, `word` starts with 'a', followed by a lowercase English letter, and ends with 'z'. Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, the minimum value of `n` is 27. In this case, `word` would start with 'a', followed by the 1st letter of the alphabet (which is 'b'), and end with 'z'. So, `word` would be 'abz'.

If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is a string that consists of the `(n-53)`th lowercase English letter and 'zz'. Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, the minimum value of `n` is 53. In this case, `word` would consist of the 0th lowercase English letter (which is 'a') and 'zz'. So, `word` would be 'azz'.

Therefore, the output of the `print(word)` statement would be one of the following:

* If `n` is between 2 and 26, `word` would be 'aa' plus the `(n-2)`th letter of the alphabet.
* If `n` is between 27 and 52, `word` would start with 'a', followed by a lowercase English letter, and end with 'z'.
* If `n` is greater than 52, `word` would consist of the `(n-53)`th lowercase English letter and 'zz'.

Output: **word (where word is a string that depends on the value of n)**
