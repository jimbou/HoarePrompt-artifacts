Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The encoding is done by summing the positions of the characters in the alphabet.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating over the possible values of the encoded word and constructing the corresponding three-letter word.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program defines the alphabet as a string of lowercase Latin letters.
2. It reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads the encoded word (an integer) and initializes an empty string `word` to store the decoded word.
4. The program then checks the value of the encoded word `n` and constructs the decoded word based on the following conditions:
   - If `n` is greater than 52, it adds the character at index `n - 53` in the alphabet to `word`, followed by 'zz'. This is because the maximum sum of three letters is 78 (26 + 26 + 26), so if `n` is greater than 52, the first letter must be at least 'a' (index 1) and the remaining two letters must be 'z' (index 26) to maximize the sum.
   - If `n` is greater than 26, it adds 'a' to `word`, followed by the character at index `n - 28` in the alphabet, and then 'z'. This is because the sum of 'a' (1) and 'z' (26) is 27, so if `n` is greater than 26, the first letter must be 'a' and the last letter must be 'z' to maximize the sum.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 26, it adds 'aa' to `word`, followed by the character at index `n - 3` in the alphabet. This is because the sum of 'a' (1) and 'a' (1) is 2, so if `n` is less than or equal to 26, the first two letters must be 'a' to minimize the sum.
5. Finally, the program prints the decoded word.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from the given integer.

Correctness: **True**
