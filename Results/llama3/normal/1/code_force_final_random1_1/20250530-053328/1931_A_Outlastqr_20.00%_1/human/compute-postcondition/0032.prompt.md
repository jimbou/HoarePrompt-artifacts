Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 26:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: stdin contains t-1 integers, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, input() is greater than 0, i is 0. If n is between 53 and 78, word is a string equal to x + 'zz', where x is a lowercase English letter. If n is between 3 and 26, word is a string consisting of 'aa' followed by a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'w'. If n is between 27 and 52, word is either 'aaz', 'abz', or 'acz', and the word is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 1, stdin contains t-2 integers, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, n is an integer greater than 1. If n > 52, word is a string that consists of the (n-53)th lowercase English letter and 'zz'. If n is between 27 and 52, word is a string that starts with 'a', followed by a lowercase English letter, and ends with 'z'. If n is between 2 and 26, word is 'aa' plus the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet. and the word is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is 2, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, n is an integer greater than 1, stdin contains t-4 integers. If n > 52, word is a string consisting of the letter that is (53 - n) positions before 'z' in the alphabet, followed by the string 'zz'. If n is larger than 26 but not greater than 52, word is a string consisting of 'a', a lowercase English letter between 'a' and 'z', and 'z'. If n is between 2 and 26, word is 'aa' followed by the (n - 2)th letter of the alphabet, and the word is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
