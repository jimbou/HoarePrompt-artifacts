This function reads a series of integers from standard input, generates a string based on each integer according to specific rules, and prints the generated strings. The rules are: if the integer is greater than 52, the string consists of the (n-53)th lowercase English letter followed by 'zz'; if the integer is between 27 and 52, the string starts with 'a', followed by a lowercase English letter, and ends with 'z'; if the integer is between 2 and 26, the string is 'aa' plus the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet. The function processes all integers provided in the input and prints the corresponding strings.
