Output State: **i is 2, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, n is an integer greater than 1, word is an empty string, stdin contains t-4 integers**.

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was previously an integer greater than 1, its value is updated to the input value. The second line initializes an empty string `word`. No other variables are affected. The value of `i` remains 2, and `alphabet` remains a string of all lowercase English letters. The stdin now contains t-4 integers, as one integer has been consumed by the input operation.
