Output State: **i is 1, stdin contains t-2 integers, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, n is an integer greater than 1, word is an empty string**.

In this final state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The number of integers in stdin decreases by 1, from t-1 to t-2, as one integer is consumed by the `input()` function. The `alphabet` variable remains unchanged, still containing all lowercase English letters. The `n` variable is assigned an integer value greater than 1, as specified by the precondition that `input()` is greater than 1. Finally, the `word` variable is initialized as an empty string.
