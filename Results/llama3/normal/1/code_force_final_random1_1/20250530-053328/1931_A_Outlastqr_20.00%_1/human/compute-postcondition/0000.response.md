Output State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t integers n (3 <= n <= 78), `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters**.

In this output state, the value of `alphabet` is assigned the string of all lowercase English letters using `string.ascii_lowercase`. The stdin still contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t integers n (3 <= n <= 78), as the code does not affect the input.
