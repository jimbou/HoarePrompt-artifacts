To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for t in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `t`. The loop will execute again if `t` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is 1, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. Since `int(input())` is not changed by the loop body, its value remains the same. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is 2, `s` is a string of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, `h` is a 2-digit string representing the hour part of the input time, `stdin` contains at least 1 input: a string `s` of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format**
