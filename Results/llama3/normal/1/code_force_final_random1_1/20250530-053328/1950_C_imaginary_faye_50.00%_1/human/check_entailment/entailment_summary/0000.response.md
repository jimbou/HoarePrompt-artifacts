Reasoning:

The given program is designed to convert 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format. It takes the input time in the format "hh:mm" and prints the equivalent time in 12-hour format.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases (t) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the input time (s) and extracts the hour (h) from the first two characters.
3. If the hour is '00', it prints '12' as the hour in 12-hour format.
4. If the hour is less than or equal to 12, it prints the hour as is.
5. If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and prints the result, padding with a leading zero if necessary.
6. It prints the minutes (s[2:]) and the AM/PM indicator based on whether the hour is greater than or equal to 12.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases for converting 24-hour time to 12-hour time.

Correctness: **True**
