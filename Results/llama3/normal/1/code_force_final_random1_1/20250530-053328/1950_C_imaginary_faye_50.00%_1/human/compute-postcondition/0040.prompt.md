Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1440) and then t strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    h = s[:2]
    if h == '00':
        print('12', end='')
    elif int(h) <= 12:
        print(h, end='')
    else:
        print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
    print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: stdin contains 1 input: t strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, s is an integer, h is a 2-digit string representing the hour part of the input time. If the hour part of the input time is '00', '12' is printed. If the hour part of the input time is not '00', the hour part of the input time is printed if it is less than or equal to 12, otherwise the hour part of the input time minus 12 is printed. The minute part of the input time and whether it is AM or PM is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is 1, s is a string of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, h is a 2-digit string representing the hour part of the input time, stdin contains at least 1 input: a string s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. If the hour part of the input time is '00', the string '12' is printed. If the hour part of the input time is less than or equal to 12, the hour part is printed as is. Otherwise, the hour part minus 12, with a leading zero if necessary, is printed, and the following is printed: the minutes part of the input time which is s[2:], and 'AM' if the hour part of the input time is less than 12, otherwise 'PM'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is 2, s is a string of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, h is a 2-digit string representing the hour part of the input time, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: the minutes part of the input time which is s[2:] and 'AM' if the hour part of the input time is less than 12, 'PM' otherwise




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
