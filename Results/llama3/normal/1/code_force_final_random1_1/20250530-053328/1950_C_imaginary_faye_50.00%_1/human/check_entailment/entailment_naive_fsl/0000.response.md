Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the hour is 12 correctly. When the hour is 12, the program should print '12' for the hour, but it also prints 'PM' if the hour is greater than or equal to 12. However, 12 is a special case where it should print 'PM' for 12:xx PM, but 'AM' for 00:xx AM. The program does not handle this case correctly.

For example, when the input is '12:14', the program will print '12:14 PM', which is correct. However, when the input is '00:59', the program will print '12:59 AM', which is also correct. But when the input is '12:00', the program will print '12:00 PM', which is correct, but when the input is '00:00', the program will print '12:00 AM', which is also correct. But the program will not handle the case when the hour is 12 correctly in all cases.

For example, when the input is '12:01', the program will print '12:01 PM', which is correct. But when the input is '12:59', the program will print '12:59 PM', which is also correct. But the program will not handle the case when the hour is 12 correctly in all cases.

The correct code should handle the case when the hour is 12 correctly. For example:

```
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) == 12:
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12 and int(h) != 0])
```

This code handles the case when the hour is 12 correctly.
