The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is less than the number of inputs in stdin, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains 1 input: t strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, s is an integer, h is a 2-digit string representing the hour part of the input time. If the hour part of the input time is '00', '12' is printed. If the hour part of the input time is not '00', the hour part of the input time is printed if it is less than or equal to 12, otherwise the hour part of the input time minus 12 is printed. The minute part of the input time and whether it is AM or PM is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time stdin must contain at least 2 inputs: t strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, s is an integer, h is a 2-digit string representing the hour part of the input time. If the hour part of the input time is '00', '12' is printed. If the hour part of the input time is not '00', the hour part of the input time is printed if it is less than or equal to 12, otherwise the hour part of the input time minus 12 is printed. The minute part of the input time and whether it is AM or PM is printed.
State: **stdin contains at least 2 inputs: t strings s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, s is an integer, h is a 2-digit string representing the hour part of the input time. If the hour part of the input time is '00', '12' is printed.
