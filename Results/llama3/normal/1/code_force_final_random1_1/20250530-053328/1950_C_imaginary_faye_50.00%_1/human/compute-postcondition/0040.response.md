Output State: **t is 0, s is a string of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, h is a 2-digit string representing the hour part of the input time, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t will be 0, the variable s will be a string representing a time in the format hh:mm, the variable h will be a 2-digit string representing the hour part of the input time, and there will be no more input in stdin.
