Functionality: **Converts 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format for multiple input times.**

This function takes multiple time inputs in 24-hour format (hh:mm) from the standard input, converts each time to 12-hour format (hh:mm AM/PM), and prints the converted times. The function iterates through each input time, adjusts the hour part according to 12-hour format rules (e.g., 00 becomes 12, 13-23 become 1-11 with PM suffix), and appends the minute part and AM/PM suffix accordingly. The function processes all input times and leaves the input stream empty after execution.
