The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4-1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If either `a` or `b` is even, then if `a1` is not equal to `b1`, the program prints 'Yes'. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program prints 'No'.**
