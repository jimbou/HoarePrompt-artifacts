Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an even integer between 1 and 10^9, `b1` is half of `b`, `b2` is half of `b`, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` is even, `a1` is half of `a`, `a2` is half of `a`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program executes the next line of code. If `a` is odd, the program does nothing.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `a`, and the condition on `a` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `b` is updated to be an even integer between 1 and 10^9, and `b1` and `b2` are assigned the value of half of `b`. The stdin now contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), since one line has been processed. The conditions on `a1` and `a2` remain the same as in the initial state.
