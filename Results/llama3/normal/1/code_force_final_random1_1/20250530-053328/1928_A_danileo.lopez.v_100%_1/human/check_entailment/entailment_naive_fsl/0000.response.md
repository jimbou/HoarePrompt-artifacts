Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. It checks if either the length or width of the rectangle is even, and if so, it checks if the resulting smaller rectangles can be combined to form a different rectangle. If both the length and width are odd, it correctly outputs "No" because no other rectangle can be formed.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If both length and width are odd, it outputs "No" because no other rectangle can be formed.
* If either length or width is even, it checks if the resulting smaller rectangles can be combined to form a different rectangle. If they can, it outputs "Yes"; otherwise, it outputs "No".

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
