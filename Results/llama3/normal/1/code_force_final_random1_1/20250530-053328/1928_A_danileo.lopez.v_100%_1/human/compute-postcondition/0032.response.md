Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4-2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a1` is an integer between 0 and 5*10^8, `a2` is an integer between 0 and 5*10^8, `a1` equals `a2`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a1` is not equal to `b`, 'Yes' is printed and stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).***
