Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4-2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9. If `a` is even, the program checks if `a // 2` equals `b`. If they are not equal, 'Yes' is printed and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop. If `a` is odd or `a // 2` equals `b`, no action is taken.***
