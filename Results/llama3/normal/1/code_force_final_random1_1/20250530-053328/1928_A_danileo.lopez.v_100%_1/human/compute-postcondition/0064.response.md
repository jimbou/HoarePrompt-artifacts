Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to 0, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` will be equal to 0, and the standard input (stdin) will be empty, meaning that all the lines containing two integers `a` and `b` will have been processed by the loop.
