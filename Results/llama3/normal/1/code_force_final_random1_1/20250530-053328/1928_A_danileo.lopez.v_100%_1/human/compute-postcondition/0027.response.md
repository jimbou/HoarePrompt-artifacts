Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4-2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is decreased by 1 because one line of input has been consumed. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the first pair of integers from the input. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers.
