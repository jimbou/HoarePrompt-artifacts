Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4-2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2`, and 'Yes' is printed because `a` is even and `a // 2` does not equal `b`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `b1`, and `b2` remain unchanged, and the condition that 'Yes' is printed because `a` is even and `a // 2` does not equal `b` is still valid.
