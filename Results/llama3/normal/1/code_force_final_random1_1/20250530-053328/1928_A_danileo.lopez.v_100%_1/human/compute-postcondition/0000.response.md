The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
