Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If either `a` or `b` is even, then if `a1` is not equal to `b1`, the program prints 'Yes'. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program prints 'No'.***
