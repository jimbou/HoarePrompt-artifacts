Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4-2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a1` is an integer between 0 and 5*10^8, `a2` is an integer between 0 and 5*10^8, `a1` equals `a2`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, `a1` and `a2` are assigned the value of `a` divided by 2, which is an integer between 0 and 5*10^8. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b.
