Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` is an even integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a1` is half of `a`, `a2` is half of `a`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The current value of `a1` is not equal to `b`.**
