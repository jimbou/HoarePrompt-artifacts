Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If either `a` or `b` is even, it means the rectangle can be cut into two equal halves. If the other dimension is not equal to the half of the even dimension, it means a different rectangle can be formed. For example, if `a` is even and `b` is not equal to `a/2`, a rectangle with dimensions `a/2` and `b` can be formed, which is different from the original rectangle.

2. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it means the rectangle cannot be cut into two equal halves. In this case, no different rectangle can be formed.

The program correctly implements this logic using if-else statements and prints "Yes" if a different rectangle can be formed and "No" otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
