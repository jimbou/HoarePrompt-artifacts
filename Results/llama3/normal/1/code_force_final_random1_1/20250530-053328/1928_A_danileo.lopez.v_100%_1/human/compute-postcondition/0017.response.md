Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an even integer between 1 and 10^9, `b1` is half of `b`, `b2` is half of `b`, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The current value of `b1` is not equal to `a`, and 'Yes' is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `b1`, and `b2` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b`, because we have skipped the current iteration of the loop and moved to the next one. The condition that the current value of `b1` is not equal to `a` still holds, and 'Yes' is still being printed.
