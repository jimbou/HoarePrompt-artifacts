To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can conclude that `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
