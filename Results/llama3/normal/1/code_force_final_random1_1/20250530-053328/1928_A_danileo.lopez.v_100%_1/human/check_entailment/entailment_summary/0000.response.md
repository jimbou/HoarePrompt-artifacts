Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a rectangle can be cut into two equal parts and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The program checks if either the length or width of the rectangle is even, and if so, it checks if the resulting smaller rectangle is different from the original rectangle. If it is, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that a different rectangle can be formed. If not, it prints 'No'. The program also correctly handles the case where both the length and width are odd, in which case it prints 'No' because no different rectangle can be formed.

Correctness: **True**
