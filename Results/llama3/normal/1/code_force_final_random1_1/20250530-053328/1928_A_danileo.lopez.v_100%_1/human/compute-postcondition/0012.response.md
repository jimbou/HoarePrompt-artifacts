Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` is even, `a1` is half of `a`, `a2` is half of `a`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program executes the next line of code. If `a` is odd, the program does nothing. The current value of `b` is even.**
