Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The current values of `a` and `b` are such that at least one of them is even. Additionally, the current value of `a` is even***
