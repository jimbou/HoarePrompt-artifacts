Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4-2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a1` is an integer between 0 and 5*10^8, `a2` is an integer between 0 and 5*10^8, `a1` equals `a2`, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), and 'Yes' is being printed.**

The continue statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. Since the initial state had t-1 lines in stdin, after executing the continue statement, there are now t-2 lines left in stdin. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. The condition `a1` equals `a2` is still valid. The 'Yes' is still being printed.
