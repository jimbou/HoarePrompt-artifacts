Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4-2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `b1` and `b2` are integers between 0 and 5*10^8, equal to each other and equal to `b // 2`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are integers between 0 and 5*10^8, equal to each other. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, 'Yes' is printed and stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the values of `b1` and `b2` are determined by the value of `b`, which is divided by 2 and assigned to both `b1` and `b2`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
