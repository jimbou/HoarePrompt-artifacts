Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an even integer between 1 and 10^9, `b1` is half of `b`, `b2` is half of `b`, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The current value of `b1` is not equal to `a`.***
