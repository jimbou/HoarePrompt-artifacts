The code accepts two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The initial values of `a` and `b` are overwritten. The value of `t` is not affected. The stdin contains two space-separated integers first and those integers are assigned into a and b. So stdin now contains no input. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4-2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains no input**
