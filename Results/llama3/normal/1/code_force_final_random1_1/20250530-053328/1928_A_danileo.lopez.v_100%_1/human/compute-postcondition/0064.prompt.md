Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
        if a % 2 == 0:
            a1, a2 = a // 2, a // 2
            if a1 != b:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        if b % 2 == 0:
            b1, b2 = b // 2, b // 2
            if b1 != a:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        print('No')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If either `a` or `b` is even, then if `a1` is not equal to `b1`, the program prints 'Yes'. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program prints 'No'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4-2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9. If `a` or `b` is even, then if `b` is even, `b1` and `b2` are integers between 0 and 5*10^8, equal to each other and equal to `b // 2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, 'Yes' is printed and stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are integers between 0 and 5*10^8, equal to each other. Otherwise, no output is printed and stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `b` is odd, no output is printed and stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), and 'No' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'No' is printed and stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4-2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9. If `a` or `b` is even, then if `b` is even, `b1` and `b2` are set to `b // 2`. If `a` is even and `a // 2` does not equal `b`, 'Yes' is printed and the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, 'No' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'No' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
