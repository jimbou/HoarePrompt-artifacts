Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `b` is even, then `b1` and `b2` are half of `b`. If `a` is even, then `a1` and `a2` are half of `a`. If `a1` is not equal to `b1`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop and prints 'Yes'. If `a` is odd, the program does nothing. If `b` is odd, the program does nothing.***
