Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` is an even integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a1` is half of `a`, `a2` is half of `a`, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The current value of `a1` is not equal to `b`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b`, because we have skipped one iteration of the loop. The condition that the current value of `a1` is not equal to `b` still holds true. Additionally, we have skipped to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
