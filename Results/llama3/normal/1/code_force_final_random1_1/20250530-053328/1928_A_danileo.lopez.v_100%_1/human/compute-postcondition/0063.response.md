Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4-2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9. If `a` or `b` is even, then if `b` is even, `b1` and `b2` are set to `b // 2`. If `a` is even and `a // 2` does not equal `b`, 'Yes' is printed and the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, 'No' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'No' is printed.***
