Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4-2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2`. If `a` is even, the program checks if `a // 2` equals `b`. If they are not equal, 'Yes' is printed and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop. If `a` is odd or `a // 2` equals `b`, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Two new variables `b1` and `b2` are introduced, both of which are assigned the value of `b // 2`. The conditional checks and actions related to `a` and `b` are still applicable, but no new actions are taken in this code snippet.
