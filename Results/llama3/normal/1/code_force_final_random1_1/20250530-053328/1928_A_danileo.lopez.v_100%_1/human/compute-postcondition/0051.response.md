Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4-2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a1` is an integer between 0 and 10^9//2, `a2` is an integer between 0 and 10^9//2, `a1` equals `a2` equals `a // 2`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, 'Yes' is printed and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
