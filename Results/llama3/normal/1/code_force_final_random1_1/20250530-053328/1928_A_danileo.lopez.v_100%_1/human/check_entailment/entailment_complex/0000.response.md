Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a rectangle can be cut into two equal parts and then rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The program first checks if either the length or width of the rectangle is even. If either is even, it calculates the half of that dimension and checks if it is equal to the other dimension. If it is not equal, it prints 'Yes' because the rectangle can be cut and rearranged to form a different rectangle. If it is equal, it prints 'No' because the rectangle cannot be cut and rearranged to form a different rectangle.

If both the length and width are odd, the program prints 'No' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two equal parts.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
