Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` is an even integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a1` is half of `a`, `a2` is half of `a`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `a` is still an even integer between 1 and 10^9, but it is now divided into two equal halves, `a1` and `a2`, each of which is half of `a`. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers a and b.
