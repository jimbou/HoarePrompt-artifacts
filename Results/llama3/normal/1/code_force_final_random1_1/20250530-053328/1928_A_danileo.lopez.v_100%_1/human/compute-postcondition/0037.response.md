Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4-2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `b1` and `b2` are integers between 0 and 5*10^8, equal to each other and equal to `b // 2`, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are integers between 0 and 5*10^8, equal to each other. 'Yes' is printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, `a` and `b` are still integers between 1 and 10^9, and `b1` and `b2` are still integers between 0 and 5*10^8, equal to each other and equal to `b // 2`. The stdin now contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If `a` is even, `a1` and `a2` are still integers between 0 and 5*10^8, equal to each other. Additionally, 'Yes' is printed.
