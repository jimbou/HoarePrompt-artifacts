Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4-2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a1` is an integer between 0 and 10^9//2, `a2` is an integer between 0 and 10^9//2, `a1` equals `a2` equals `a // 2`, 'Yes' is being printed and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, and `a2` remain the same as in the initial state. The condition `a1` equals `a2` equals `a // 2` still holds true. The program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop, and 'Yes' is still being printed.
