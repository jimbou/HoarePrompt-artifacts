Based on the precondition, the code will print 'No' only when the following conditions are met:

*   `a` is even
*   `b` is even
*   `a1` is equal to `b1`

If any of these conditions are not met, the program will either skip to the next iteration of the loop or do nothing, and it will not print 'No'.

However, since the code snippet only contains a single print statement that prints 'No' regardless of the conditions, the output will always be 'No' if the code is executed.

Output: **No**
