The code prints the string 'Yes' if `a` is even and `a // 2` does not equal `b`. Since `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and `b` is also an integer between 1 and 10^9, we can't determine the exact value of `a // 2` and `b` without knowing the exact values of `a` and `b`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output 'Yes' if the conditions are met.
Output: **Yes (if a is even and a // 2 does not equal b)**
