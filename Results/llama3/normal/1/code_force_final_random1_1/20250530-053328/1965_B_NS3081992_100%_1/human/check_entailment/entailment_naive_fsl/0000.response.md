Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the given code. The code seems to handle all possible cases correctly, including edge cases. 

The function `func_14()` generates a sequence of non-negative integers that meets the conditions specified in the problem description. It correctly handles the cases where `k` is 1 and where `k` is greater than 1. 

The use of binary representation to generate the sequence is a clever approach, and the code correctly calculates the sum of the sequence to ensure that it does not equal `k`. 

I have not been able to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
