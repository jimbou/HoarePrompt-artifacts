According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the function `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the function `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer and the functions `func_14()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `func_10()` returns at least 1 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`func_10()` returns at least 1, `_` is 0, `func_14()` returns a value that can be converted to a string**
