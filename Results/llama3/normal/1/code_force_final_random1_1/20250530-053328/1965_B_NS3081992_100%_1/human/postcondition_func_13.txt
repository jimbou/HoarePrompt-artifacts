This function generates a list of integers based on the binary representation of input integers n and k, and returns a string containing the length of the list and its elements. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns a specific string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs the list by appending powers of 2, k-related values, and additional powers of 2, and returns the list's length and elements as a string.
