Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a binary string of length `l`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, `bk` is a binary string equal to the binary representation of `k`, `ans` is a list containing the integers 1, 2 and 4, `lk` is an integer equal to the length of `bk` and must be at least 3, `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the integer 4, which is the result of 2 raised to the power of `i` (2^2). The other variables remain unchanged.
