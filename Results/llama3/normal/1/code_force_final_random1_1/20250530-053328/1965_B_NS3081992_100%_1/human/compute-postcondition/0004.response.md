To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the return value of `func_10()`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `func_10()` returns at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `func_10()` still needs to return at least 2.


State: **`_` is 2, `func_10()` returns at least 2, `func_14()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, and the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` is printed to the standard output followed by a newline character, and the standard output is updated with the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character.**
