To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(lk - 1):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `lk`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `lk`. If `i` is less than `lk - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `lk` is an integer equal to the length of `bk` and must be at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `lk` is at least 3, the loop can execute again if `lk` is still at least 3.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is 2
* `lk` is an integer equal to the length of `bk` and must be at least 3

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `ans`) are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a binary string of length `l`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, `bk` is a binary string equal to the binary representation of `k`, `ans` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, `lk` is an integer equal to the length of `bk` and must be at least 3, `i` is 2**
