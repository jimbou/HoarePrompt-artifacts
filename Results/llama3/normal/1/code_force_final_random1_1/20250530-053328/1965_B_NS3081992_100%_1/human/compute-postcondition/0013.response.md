Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a binary string of length `l`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, `bk` is a binary string equal to the binary representation of `k`, `ans` is a list containing the integers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, `lk` is an integer equal to the length of `bk` and must be at least 21, `i` is 20.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ans` contains all the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
