Output State: **The program returns a string that contains the length of the list 'ans' and the elements of the list 'ans'. The length of 'ans' is equal to the number of elements in the list, which is 2^(lk-2) + 5, where lk is the length of the binary representation of k. The elements of 'ans' are the integers 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1), where l is the length of the binary representation of n.**
