You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns a string '1\n2'. The string '1' is a binary string of length 1, and the string '2' is a decimal number that is equal to the value of n. The value of n is 2, and k is equal to 1. The length of the binary string b is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of n, which is 1.
        #State: *n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, k is equal to 1, b is a binary string of length l, l is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of n, and n is not equal to 2
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a binary string of length `l`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, `bk` is a binary string equal to the binary representation of `k`, `ans` is a list containing the integers 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), `lk` is an integer equal to the length of `bk` and must be at least 2, `i` is lk-2.
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)

    #State: *n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, b is a binary string of length l, l is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of n. If k is equal to 1 and n is not equal to 2, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and k is not equal to 1, b is a binary string of length l, lk is an integer equal to the length of the binary representation of k and must be at least 2 and less than l, i is equal to l, ans is a list containing the integers 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1).
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a string that contains the length of the list 'ans' and the elements of the list 'ans'. The length of 'ans' is equal to the number of elements in the list, which is 2^(lk-2) + 5, where lk is the length of the binary representation of k. The elements of 'ans' are the integers 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1), where l is the length of the binary representation of n.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: *n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, k is equal to 1, b is a binary string of length l, l is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of n, and n is not equal to 2

Case_2: The program returns a string that contains the length of the list 'ans' and the elements of the list 'ans'. The length of 'ans' is equal to the number of elements in the list, which is 2^(lk-2) + 5, where lk is the length of the binary representation of k. The elements of 'ans' are the integers 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1), where l is the length of the binary representation of n.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
