Output State: **`func_10()` returns at least 1, `_` is 0, `func_14()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, and the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` is printed to the standard output followed by a newline character.**

In this output state, the values of `func_10()` and `_` remain unchanged. The value returned by `func_14()` is converted to a string using the `str()` function and then printed to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write()`, followed by a newline character. The output state still includes the information that `func_10()` returns at least 1 and `_` is 0, as these values are not affected by the code.
