Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the standard output has been updated with the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character, for a total of `func_10()` iterations.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and the standard output has been updated with the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character, for a total number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`.
