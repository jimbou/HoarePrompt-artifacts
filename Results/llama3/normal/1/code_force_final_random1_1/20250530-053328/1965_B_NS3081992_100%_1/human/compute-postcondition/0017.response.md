Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a binary string of length `l`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, `bk` is a binary string equal to the binary representation of `k`, `lk` is an integer equal to the length of `bk` and must be at least 2 and less than `l`, `i` is equal to `lk`, `ans` is a list containing the integers 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), `k` - 1 - sum(ans), `k` + 1, 2 * `k` + 1, 2^`i`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending 2 raised to the power of `i`, where `i` is equal to `lk`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
