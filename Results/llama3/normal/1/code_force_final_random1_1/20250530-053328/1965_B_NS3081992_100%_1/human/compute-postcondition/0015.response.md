Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and k is not equal to 1, b is a binary string of length l, l is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of n, bk is a binary string equal to the binary representation of k, lk is an integer equal to the length of bk and must be at least 2, i is lk-2, ans is a list containing the integers 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1.**

The code appends three new elements to the list `ans`. The first element is `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, which is calculated by subtracting the sum of all existing elements in `ans` from `k - 1`. The second element is `k + 1`, and the third element is `2 * k + 1`. These new elements are added to the end of the list `ans`, which initially contained the integers 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2). The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`, and `i` remain unchanged.
