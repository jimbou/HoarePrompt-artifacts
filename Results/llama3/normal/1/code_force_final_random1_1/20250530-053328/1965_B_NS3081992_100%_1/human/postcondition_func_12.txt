This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers, a and b, where a is greater than or equal to b. It also returns the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a), indicating that the GCD is a and the coefficients are 1 and 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function, func_13, to calculate the GCD and coefficients, and then returns the calculated values.
