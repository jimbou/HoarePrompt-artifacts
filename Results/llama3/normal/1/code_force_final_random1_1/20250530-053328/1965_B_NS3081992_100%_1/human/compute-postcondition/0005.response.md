Output State: **`_` is 2, `func_10()` returns at least 2, `func_14()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, the standard output is updated with the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character, and the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` is printed to the standard output followed by a newline character.**

The code writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character to the standard output, but does not change the values of the variables `_` and the return values of `func_10()` and `func_14()`. The standard output is updated with the new string.
