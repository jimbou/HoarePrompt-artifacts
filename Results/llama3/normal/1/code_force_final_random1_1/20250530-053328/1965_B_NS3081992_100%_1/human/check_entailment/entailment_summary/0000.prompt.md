Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    func_15()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  Reads an integer from standard input and returns it, ensuring the returned value is greater than 0.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  Reads two positive integers n and k from the standard input, where n is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive) and k is between 1 and n (inclusive), and returns them as a map object.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  Reads a line from standard input, splits it into two space-separated integers, and returns them as a list of two positive integers, where the first integer is n and the second integer is k, such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  This function generates a list of elements by repeatedly calling the 'func_3()' function a specified number of times, equal to the value of the 'rows_number' parameter, and returns the resulting list. The function does not modify the input 'rows_number' parameter. The exact values of the elements in the returned list are determined by the 'func_3()' function, which is not defined in the provided code.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  Reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin), removes the trailing newline character if present, and returns the resulting string. If the standard input is empty, returns an empty string.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads a single string input from standard input (stdin) and returns it as a decoded string, stripped of any trailing newline characters.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads a single line of input from stdin, splits it into two space-separated integers, and returns them as a list of two integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function generates a list of a specified length, where each element is the result of calling the function func_7(), and returns this list. The length of the returned list is equal to the input parameter 'rows', which must be a non-negative integer.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function reads a string from standard input and returns it unchanged, effectively echoing the input string.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function reads an integer greater than 0 from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or transformations.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function reads a string of two space-separated integers from standard input and returns them as a list of two strings, without performing any validation or conversion on the input values.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates a rank value based on a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It returns an integer value representing the calculated rank. If the list associated with the key `da` in `d` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates over the elements in the list, updates the `processing` list, and recursively calls another function `func_12` to calculate a minimum value. The function then updates the `rank` list with this minimum value plus 1 and returns the same value.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers, a and b, where a is greater than or equal to b. It also returns the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a), indicating that the GCD is a and the coefficients are 1 and 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function, func_13, to calculate the GCD and coefficients, and then returns the calculated values.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:

        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  This function generates a list of integers based on the binary representation of input integers n and k, and returns a string containing the length of the list and its elements. If k is 1 and n is 2, it returns a specific string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs the list by appending powers of 2, k-related values, and additional powers of 2, and returns the list's length and elements as a string.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character to the standard output, repeating this process a number of times equal to the non-negative integer returned by `func_10()`.
