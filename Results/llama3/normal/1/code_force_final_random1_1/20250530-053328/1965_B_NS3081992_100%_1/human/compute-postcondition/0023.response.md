Postcondition: ***n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, b is a binary string of length l, l is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of n. If k is equal to 1 and n is not equal to 2, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and k is not equal to 1, b is a binary string of length l, lk is an integer equal to the length of the binary representation of k and must be at least 2 and less than l, i is equal to l, ans is a list containing the integers 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1).***
