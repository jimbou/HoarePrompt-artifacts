This function generates a list of elements by repeatedly calling the 'func_3()' function a specified number of times, equal to the value of the 'rows_number' parameter, and returns the resulting list. The function does not modify the input 'rows_number' parameter. The exact values of the elements in the returned list are determined by the 'func_3()' function, which is not defined in the provided code.
