To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `lk`, and `l`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `l`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `lk` + 1, and `lk` is an integer equal to the length of `bk` and must be at least 2 and less than `l`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `lk` + 2. Since `lk` is less than `l`, `i` is still less than `l`, and the loop can execute again.

The state of `lk` and `l` remains the same, as they are not modified in the loop head.

The state of the other variables, `n`, `k`, `b`, `bk`, `ans`, remains the same, as they are not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is a binary string of length `l`, `l` is an integer equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, `bk` is a binary string equal to the binary representation of `k`, `lk` is an integer equal to the length of `bk` and must be at least 2 and less than `l`, `i` is equal to `lk` + 2, `ans` is a list containing the integers 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-1), `k` - 1 - sum(ans), `k` + 1, 2 * `k` + 1, 2^`i`, 2^(lk+1)**
