The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and the return value of `func_10()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_10()`. If the return value of `func_10()` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the return value of `func_10()` is at least 1 and `_` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, the return value of `func_10()` must be greater than 1 and `_` is 1.
State: **`func_10()` returns at least 2, `_` is 1, `func_14()` returns a value that can be converted to a string, and the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` is printed to the standard output followed by a newline character.**
