Output State: **_ is 2, t is greater than -1 and decremented by 1, n is an integer, s is a string, pk is half of n**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `t` is still greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1, so it is now greater than -1. The value of `n` remains an integer. The value of `s` remains a string. The new variable `pk` is assigned the value of `n` divided by 2, which is half of `n`.
