The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1. Since `t` is assigned the first integer from the input, it is now equal to the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, with one test case partially consumed (only the integer `n` has been read).**
