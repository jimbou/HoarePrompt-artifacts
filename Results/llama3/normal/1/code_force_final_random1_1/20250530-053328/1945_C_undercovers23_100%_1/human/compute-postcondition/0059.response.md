Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing all elements, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is an integer equal to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` that have an absolute difference between `pk` and the element equal to `mini`, and `c1` is an integer equal to `o * 100 // n`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `c1` which is calculated as the percentage of '1's in the string `s`. The value of `c1` is equal to the number of '1's in `s` multiplied by 100 and divided by the length of `s`.
