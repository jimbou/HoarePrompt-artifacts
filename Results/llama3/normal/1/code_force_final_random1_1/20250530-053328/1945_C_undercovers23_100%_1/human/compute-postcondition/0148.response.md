The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than -5 and decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is a string, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` of `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` of `s` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0, `i` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0 if the character at index `i` of `s` is not '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 0 if the character at index `i` of `s` is '0', otherwise `one_perc` is (o - 1) * 100 // (n - 1). If the current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing the value `i + 1` and `mini` is 100000000. Otherwise, `lst` is an empty list and `mini` is 100000000.**
