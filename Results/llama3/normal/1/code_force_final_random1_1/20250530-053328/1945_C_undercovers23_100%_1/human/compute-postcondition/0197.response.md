Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing only 0s and 1s. For each test case, it calculates the percentage of 0s and 1s in the string and finds the position where the percentage of 0s and 1s is closest to 50%. If no such position exists, it returns 0 if the percentage of 1s is greater than or equal to 50%, or n if the percentage of 1s is less than 50%. The function then prints the smallest such position for each test case.**
