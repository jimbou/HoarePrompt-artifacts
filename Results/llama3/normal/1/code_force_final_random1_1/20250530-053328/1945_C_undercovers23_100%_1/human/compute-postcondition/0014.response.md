Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0, and either `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0 if the current value of `s[i]` is '0', or `zero` is 0 and `one` is 1 if the current value of `s[i]` is '1'.**
