Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 1, t is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer that must be at least 2, s is a string of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1, pk is an integer equal to n/2 if n is even, otherwise pk is a float equal to n/2, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, lst is an empty list, mini is the minimum of the current mini and the absolute difference between pk and all elements in lst, i is n - 2, zero_perc is an integer equal to zero * 100 // (i + 1), one_perc is an integer equal to (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1), zero is the number of '0's in the first n - 1 characters of s, one is the number of '1's in the first n - 1 characters of s, ele is not defined, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst that have an absolute difference between pk and the element equal to mini, and c1 is an integer equal to o * 100 // n. If c1 is greater than or equal to 50, final contains an additional element 0. If c1 is less than 50, final contains n as an additional element, and the first element of the sorted list final is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_ is 1, t is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, s is a string of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1, pk is an integer equal to n/2 if n is even, otherwise pk is a float equal to n/2, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, lst is a list containing the integer i + 1, mini is the minimum of the current mini and the absolute difference between pk and i + 1, i is 0, zero_perc is an integer equal to (zero + 1) * 100 // (i + 1) if s[i] is '0', otherwise zero_perc is an integer equal to zero * 100 // (i + 1), one_perc is an integer equal to (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1), zero is the number of '0's in the first n - 1 characters of s, one is the number of '1's in the first n - 1 characters of s, ele is not defined, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst that have an absolute difference between pk and the element equal to mini, and c1 is an integer equal to o * 100 // n. If c1 is greater than or equal to 50, final contains an additional element 0. If c1 is less than 50, final contains n as an additional element, and the first element of the sorted list final is printed. Additionally, if s[i] is '0', z is incremented by 1, otherwise o is incremented by 1 and the character at index i in string s is '1'. If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then the current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 1, t is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, s is a string of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1, pk is an integer equal to n/2 if n is even, otherwise pk is a float equal to n/2, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, lst is a list containing the integer i + 1 and i + 1, mini is the minimum of the current mini and the absolute difference between pk and i + 1, i is 1, zero_perc is an integer equal to (z) * 100 // (i + 1), one_perc is an integer equal to (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1), one is the number of '1's in the first n - 1 characters of s, ele is not defined, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst that have an absolute difference between pk and the element equal to mini, and c1 is an integer equal to o * 100 // n. If c1 is greater than or equal to 50, final contains an additional element 0. If c1 is less than 50, final contains n as an additional element, and the first element of the sorted list final is printed. Additionally, if s[i] is '0', z is incremented by 1, otherwise o is incremented by 1 and the character at index i in string s is '1'. If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then the current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50. If zero_perc is less than 50 or one_perc is less than 50, then the current value of zero_perc is less than 50 or the current value of one_perc is less than 50.

If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then the current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50. If zero_perc is less than 50 or one_perc is less than 50, then the current value of zero_perc is less than 50 or the current value of one_perc is less than 50.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
