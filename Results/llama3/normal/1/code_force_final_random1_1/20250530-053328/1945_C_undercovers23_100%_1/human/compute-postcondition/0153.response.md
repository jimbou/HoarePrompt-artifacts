Output State: **_ is 2, t is greater than -7 and decremented by 1, n is greater than 2, s is a string, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is 1 if the character at index i of s is '0', otherwise zero is 0, one is 1 if the character at index i of s is not '0', otherwise one is 0, i is 1, zero_perc is the value of zero * 100 // (i + 1), one_perc is the value of (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1), lst is a list containing the value i + 1 if the current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise lst is a list containing the value i + 1, mini is 100000000.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `_` remains 2. The value of `t` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than -7. The value of `n` is still greater than 2. The string `s` and its list of characters `sl` remain unchanged. The number of '1's `o` and '0's `z` in `s` also remain the same. The values of `zero` and `one` are still dependent on the character at index `i` of `s`. The value of `i` is still 1. The percentages `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are still calculated based on `zero`, `o`, `n`, and `i`. The list `lst` now contains the value `i + 1` regardless of the previous conditions. The value of `mini` remains 100000000.
