To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `lst`. The loop will execute if `lst` has at least one element. 

Considering the conditions for `lst` to have elements (i.e., `zero_perc` ≥ 50 and `one_perc` ≥ 50), we need to adjust the states of `zero_perc` and `one_perc` to ensure they meet these conditions.

State: **_ is 2, t is greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, n is an integer, s is a string, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is the number of '0's in s, one is the number of '1's in s, i is n-2, zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50, one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, lst is a list containing at least one value i + 1, mini is 100000000, ele is the first element in lst**
