Output: ** `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is a float equal to `n/2`, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to (`z`) * 100 // (`i + 1`), `one_perc` is an integer equal to (`o - one`) * 100 // (`n - i - 1`) if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one_perc` is an integer equal to (`o - one - 1`) * 100 // (`n - i - 1`), `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s` if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s` plus 1, `ele` is the last element in the list, `c1` is an integer equal to `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the list `final` contains a single element 0. If `c1` is less than 50, the list `final` contains `n`. The first element of the list `final` is being printed, which is either 0 or `n` depending on whether `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50, respectively.**
