Output State: **_*_ is 2, t is greater than -10 and decremented by 1, n is greater than 3, s is a string, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s and increased by 1 if the character at index i of s is '0', zero is 1 if the character at index i of s is '0', otherwise zero is 0, one is 1 if the character at index i of s is not '0', otherwise one is 0, i is 2, zero_perc is the value of zero * 100 // (i + 1), one_perc is the value of (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1), lst is a list containing the value i + 1 if the current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise lst is a list containing the value i + 1, and the value 3, mini is 100000000.**

In this output state, the value of lst has been updated by appending the value i + 1, which is 3, to the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
