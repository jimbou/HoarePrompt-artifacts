Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing the value `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0, the current value of `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, the current value of `one_perc` is an integer equal to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and either the current value of `zero` is 1 and the current value of `one` is 0 if the current value of `s[i]` is '0', or the current value of `zero` is 0 and the current value of `one` is 1 if the current value of `s[i]` is '1'.**
