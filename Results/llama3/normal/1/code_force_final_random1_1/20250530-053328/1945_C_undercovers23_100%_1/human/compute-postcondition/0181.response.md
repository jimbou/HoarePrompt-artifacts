Postcondition: **The program maintains its initial state with `_` equal to 2, `t` greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, `n` as an integer, `s` as a string, `sl` as a list of characters in `s`, `o` and `z` as the counts of '1's and '0's in `s` respectively, `zero` and `one` as the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` respectively, `i` as n-2, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` greater than or equal to 50, `lst` as a list containing at least 3 values, `ele` as the third element in `lst`, and `mini` as the minimum of the previous minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Additionally, if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` contains the first element in `lst`, `elem`, and the newly appended `elem`. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
