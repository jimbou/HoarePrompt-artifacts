Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 2, t is greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, n is an integer, s is a string, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is the number of '0's in s, one is the number of '1's in s, i is n-2, zero_perc is the value of zero * 100 // (n-1), one_perc is the value of (o - one) * 100 // 1, lst is a list containing the values i + 1 for all i where the current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, mini is 100000000.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 2, `t` is greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing at least one value `i + 1`, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 2, `t` is greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing at least two values, including `i + 1`, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the previous minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 2, `t` is greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing at least three values, including `i + 1`, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, and `mini` is the minimum of the previous minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
