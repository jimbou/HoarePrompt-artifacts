Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing the values 3 and `i + 1`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is an integer equal to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is 2 and `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise `one` is 0. If `s[i]` is '1', then `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 2 and `one` is 2 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise `one` is 1.**

In this output state, the list `lst` now contains the value `i + 1`, which is 3, in addition to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
