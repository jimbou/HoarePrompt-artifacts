Output State: **_ is 2, t is greater than -n-2 and decremented by 1, n is an integer, s is a string, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is the number of '0's in s, one is the number of '1's in s, i is n-2, zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50, one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, lst is an empty list, ele is undefined, mini is the minimum of the previous minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between pk and the last element in lst, final contains all elements in lst that have an absolute difference with pk equal to mini and is sorted in ascending order, and c1 is the percentage of '1's in s.**

In this output state, the value of c1 is calculated as the percentage of '1's in s, which is o * 100 // n. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
