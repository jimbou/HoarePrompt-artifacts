The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **_* is 2, t is greater than -7 and decremented by 1, n is greater than 3, s is a string, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is 1 if the character at index i of s is '0', otherwise zero is 0, one is 1 if the character at index i of s is not '0', otherwise one is 0, i is 2, zero_perc is the value of zero * 100 // (i + 1), one_perc is the value of (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1), lst is a list containing the value i + 1 if the current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise lst is a list containing the value i + 1, mini is 100000000**
