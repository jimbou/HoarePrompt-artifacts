Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `i` is n-2, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is an empty list, `ele` is undefined, `mini` is the minimum of the previous minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and the last element in `lst`, and `final` contains all elements in `lst` that have an absolute difference with `pk` equal to `mini` and is sorted in ascending order.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the list `final` is now sorted in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged.
