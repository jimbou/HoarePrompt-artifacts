The only objects in the loop head are variables  elem and list  lst, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lst.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, elem is the last element in the list.
State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing at least one value, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the previous minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, `final` is an empty list, and `elem` is the first element in `lst`**
