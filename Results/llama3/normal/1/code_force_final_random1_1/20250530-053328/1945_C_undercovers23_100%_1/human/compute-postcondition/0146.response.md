Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than -5 and decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` of `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` of `s` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0, `lst` is a list containing the value `i + 1`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0, `zero_perc` is 0 if the character at index `i` of `s` is not '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 0 if the character at index `i` of `s` is '0', otherwise `one_perc` is (o - 1) * 100 // (n - 1). The current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.**

In this output state, the value of `lst` has been updated to contain the value `i + 1`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
