To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for ele in lst:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `ele` and `lst`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ele` is the first element in `lst`, and `lst` is a list containing at least one value `i + 1`.

For the loop to execute again, `lst` must have at least two elements, and `ele` must be the second element in `lst`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `ele` is the second element in `lst`
* `lst` is a list containing at least two values, including `i + 1` and the second element

The other variables in the state, such as `_`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `i`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `mini`, are not affected by the loop head and remain unchanged.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing at least two values, including `i + 1`, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`**
