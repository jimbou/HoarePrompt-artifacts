Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the position of the house after which the road should be laid to satisfy the condition that at least half of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice. The program iterates over the string `s` and calculates the percentage of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the road. It then checks if the condition is satisfied and updates the list `lst` with the positions that satisfy the condition. Finally, it finds the position with the minimum absolute difference with `pk` and prints it.

The program also handles the edge cases where the length of `final` is 0, in which case it checks the percentage of '1's in `s` and prints 0 if it is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` if it is less than 50.

Correctness: **True**
