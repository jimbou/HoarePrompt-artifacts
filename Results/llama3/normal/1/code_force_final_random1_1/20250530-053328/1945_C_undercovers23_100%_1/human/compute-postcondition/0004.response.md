Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `n` is an even integer, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n/2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, and it represents the number of test cases. The value of `_` is still 0. The standard input contains multiple test cases, each containing a string `a` of length `n`, which consists only of 0 and 1. The length `n` is an even integer. The string `s` is still of length `n` and consists only of 0 and 1. A new variable `pk` is introduced, which is an integer equal to half of the length `n`.
