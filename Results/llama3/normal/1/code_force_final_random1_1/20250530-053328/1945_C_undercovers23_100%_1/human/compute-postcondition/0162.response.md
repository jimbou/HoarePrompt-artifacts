Output State: **_ is 2, t is greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, n is an integer, s is a string, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is the number of '0's in s, one is the number of '1's in s, i is n-2, zero_perc is the value of zero * 100 // (n-1), one_perc is the value of (o - one) * 100 // 1, lst is a list containing the values i + 1 for all i where the current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, mini is 100000000.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations. The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `o`, and `mini` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The values of `zero`, `one`, `i`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` have been updated based on the loop's execution. The list `lst` now contains all the indices `i+1` where the conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` were met during the loop's execution.
