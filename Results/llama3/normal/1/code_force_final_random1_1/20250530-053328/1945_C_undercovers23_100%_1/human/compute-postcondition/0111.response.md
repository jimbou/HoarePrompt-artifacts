Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is a float equal to `n/2`, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing `n-1` elements, each of which is the index `i+1`, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to (`z`) * 100 // (`i + 1`), `one_perc` is an integer equal to (`o - one`) * 100 // (`n - i - 1`) if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one_perc` is an integer equal to (`o - one - 1`) * 100 // (`n - i - 1`), `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s` if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s` plus 1, `ele` is the last element in the list, `final` contains an additional element `elem`, and `c1` is an integer equal to `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains an additional element 0. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` contains `n` as an additional element, and the first element of the sorted list `final` is printed. Additionally, if `s[i]` is '0', `z` is incremented by 1, otherwise `o` is incremented by 1 and the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1'. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then the current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. If `zero_perc` is less than 50 or `one_perc` is less than 50, then the current value of `zero_perc` is less than 50 or the current value of `one_perc` is less than 50, `lst` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list. The absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of `elem` to the list `final`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
