Output State: **_ is 2, t is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, n is an integer, s is a string**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `s`. The initial state of `_` and `t` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The value of `n` is now an integer, and the value of `s` is a string. The state of `t` is still greater than 0 and decremented by 1, indicating that it has been decremented by 1 at some point before the code execution.
