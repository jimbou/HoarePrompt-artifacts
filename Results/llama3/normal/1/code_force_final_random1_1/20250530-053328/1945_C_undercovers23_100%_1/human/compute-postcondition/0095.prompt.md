You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet consisting of multiple lines. Your task is to execute all the lines in sequence and provide the output state after the entire code block has been run. Avoid describing how the program runs step-by-step for individual lines but instead focus on the combined effect of all lines. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations.  

Include all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution and update the values of any variables that are modified by the code. Provide the final state, icluding the state of all the variables after the execution of the code snippet. Use the text format: Output State: **output state**.

Here are some examples to help you understand the task:

Example 1:
Initial State: `a` is 5, `b` is 3
```
c = a + b
d = c * 2
```

Example Answer 1:
The first line assigns the value of `a + b` to `c`. Since `a` is 5 and `b` is 3, `c` becomes 8. The second line assigns the value of `c * 2` to `d`, making `d` equal to 16. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **a is 5, b is 3, c is 8, d is 16**

Example 2:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer , stdin contains 2 inputs: an integer and a second integer
```
n= int(input())
x += n
```

Example Answer 2:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. So now stdin only contains one integer now. The second line increments `x` by the value of `n`. The value of `x` is a positive integer, and `n` is an integer. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **x is a positive integer equal to its original value plus n , n is an integer, stdin contains 1 input: an integer **

Example 3:
Initial State: `n` is 3, `total` is 1 , stdin contains a space-separated list of integers
```
nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
total += n
pass
n= max(total, n)
```

Example Answer 3:
The first line assins to num a list of integers from stdin. Stdin is now empty so we dont include it in the output state.The second line increments `total` by the value of `n`, making `total` equal to 4. The thir line does not affect any variables. The 4th line assigns the maximum value between `total` and `n` to `n`. Since `total` is 4, and n was 3, `n` becomes 4.
Output State: **n is 4, total is 4**

Your Task:
Initial State: *_ is 1, t is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, n is an integer that must be greater than 2, s is a string of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1, pk is an integer equal to n/2 if n is even, otherwise pk is a float equal to n/2, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, lst is a list containing the integer i + 1 and i + 1, mini is the minimum of the current mini and the absolute difference between pk and i + 1, i is 2, zero_perc is an integer equal to (z) * 100 // (i + 1), one_perc is an integer equal to (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1) if s[i] is '0', otherwise one_perc is an integer equal to (o - one - 1) * 100 // (n - i - 1), one is the number of '1's in the first n - 1 characters of s if s[i] is '0', otherwise one is the number of '1's in the first n - 1 characters of s plus 1, ele is not defined, final is a sorted list containing all elements in lst that have an absolute difference between pk and the element equal to mini, and c1 is an integer equal to o * 100 // n. If c1 is greater than or equal to 50, final contains an additional element 0. If c1 is less than 50, final contains n as an additional element, and the first element of the sorted list final is printed. Additionally, if s[i] is '0', z is incremented by 1, otherwise o is incremented by 1 and the character at index i in string s is '1'. If zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, then the current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50. If zero_perc is less than 50 or one_perc is less than 50, then the current value of zero_perc is less than 50 or the current value of one_perc is less than 50.
```
zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)

```
Now, please analyze the entire block of code and provide the final output state. List the impact of all lines on the program, check the previous values of affected variables, and calculate the states of the variables after the codeexecutes. Be as specific as possible, combining changes from all lines into a single coherent final state. Include all valid information from the precondition and update only what is modified by the code.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans
