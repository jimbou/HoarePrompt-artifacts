Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, with one test case partially consumed (only the integer `n` has been read).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        pk = n / 2
    else:
        pk = n / 2
    sl = list(s)
    o = sl.count('1')
    z = sl.count('0')
    zero, one = 0, 0
    lst = []
    mini = pow(10, 8)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            zero += 1
        else:
            one += 1
        zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
        one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
        if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
            lst.append(i + 1)
    for ele in lst:
        mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
    final = []
    for elem in lst:
        if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
            final.append(elem)
    final.sort()
    if len(final) == 0:
        c1 = o * 100 // n
        if c1 >= 50:
            final.append(0)
        else:
            final.append(n)
    print(final[0])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing all elements, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is an integer equal to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements in `lst` that have an absolute difference between `pk` and the element equal to `mini`, and `c1` is an integer equal to `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains an additional element 0. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` contains `n` as an additional element, and the first element of the sorted list `final` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is a float equal to `n/2`, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to (`z`) * 100 // (`i + 1`), `one_perc` is an integer equal to (`o - one`) * 100 // (`n - i - 1`) if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one_perc` is an integer equal to (`o - one - 1`) * 100 // (`n - i - 1`), `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s` if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s` plus 1, `ele` is the last element in the list, `c1` is an integer equal to `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, the list `final` contains a single element 0. If `c1` is less than 50, the list `final` contains `n`. The first element of the list `final` is being printed, which is either 0 or `n` depending on whether `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50, respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, t is greater than -n-2 and decremented by 1, n is an integer, s is a string, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is the number of '0's in s, one is the number of '1's in s, i is n-2, zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50, one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, lst is an empty list, ele is undefined, mini is the minimum of the previous minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between pk and the last element in lst, final contains all elements in lst that have an absolute difference with pk equal to mini, is sorted in ascending order. If the length of final is 0, then final contains 0 if the percentage of '1's in s is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise it contains n, and the first element of final is printed which is either the smallest element in lst with an absolute difference with pk equal to mini or 0 if the length of final is 0 and the percentage of '1's in s is greater than or equal to 50, or n if the length of final is 0 and the percentage of '1's in s is less than 50.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
