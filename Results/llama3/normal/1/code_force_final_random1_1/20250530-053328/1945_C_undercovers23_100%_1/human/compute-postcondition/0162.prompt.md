Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 2, t is greater than -2 and decremented by 1, n is an integer, s is a string, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is 0, one is 0, lst is an empty list, mini is 100000000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is 2, `t` is greater than -5 and decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` of `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0, `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` of `s` is not '0', otherwise `one` is 0, `i` is 0, `zero_perc` is 0 if the character at index `i` of `s` is not '0', otherwise `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 0 if the character at index `i` of `s` is '0', otherwise `one_perc` is (o - 1) * 100 // (n - 1). If the current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is a list containing the value `i + 1` and `mini` is 100000000. Otherwise, `lst` is an empty list and `mini` is 100000000.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *_ is 2, t is greater than -7 and decremented by 1, n is greater than 2, s is a string, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is 1 if the character at index i of s is '0', otherwise zero is 0, one is 1 if the character at index i of s is not '0', otherwise one is 0, i is 1, zero_perc is the value of zero * 100 // (i + 1), one_perc is the value of (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1), lst is a list containing the value i + 1 if the current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise lst is a list containing the value i + 1, mini is 100000000.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *_ is 2, t is greater than -10 and decremented by 1, n is greater than 3, s is a string, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s and increased by 1 if the character at index i of s is '0', zero is 1 if the character at index i of s is '0', otherwise zero is 0, one is 1 if the character at index i of s is not '0', otherwise one is 0, i is 2, zero_perc is the value of zero * 100 // (i + 1), one_perc is the value of (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1), lst is a list containing the value i + 1 if the current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise lst is a list containing the value i + 1, and if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50, then lst also contains the value 3, mini is 100000000.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
