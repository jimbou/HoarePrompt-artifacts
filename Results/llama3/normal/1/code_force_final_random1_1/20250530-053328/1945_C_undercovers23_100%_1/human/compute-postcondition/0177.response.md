Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `i` is n-2, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing at least 2 values, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the previous minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, and `final` contains the first element in `lst` and `elem`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of `elem` to the `final` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
