Postcondition: **_ is 2, t is greater than -n-2 and decremented by 1, n is an integer, s is a string, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is the number of '0's in s, one is the number of '1's in s, i is n-2, zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50, one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, lst is an empty list, ele is undefined, mini is the minimum of the previous minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between pk and the last element in lst, final contains all elements in lst that have an absolute difference with pk equal to mini, is sorted in ascending order. If the length of final is 0, then final contains 0 if the percentage of '1's in s is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise it contains n.**
