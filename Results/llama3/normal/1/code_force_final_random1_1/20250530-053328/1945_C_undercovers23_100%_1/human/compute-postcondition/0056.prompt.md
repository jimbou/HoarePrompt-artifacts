Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing all elements, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is an integer equal to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing all elements that must have at least 1 element, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is an integer equal to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing the first element in the list if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list is equal to `mini`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing all elements that must have at least 2 elements, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is an integer equal to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, and `final` is a list containing the first element in the list if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list is equal to `mini`, and if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list is equal to `mini`, `final` also contains the second element in `lst`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing all elements that must have at least 3 elements, `mini` is the minimum of the current `mini` and the absolute difference between `pk` and all elements in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is an integer equal to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `zero` is the number of '0's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in the first `n - 1` characters of `s`, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, and `final` is a list containing the first element in the list if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list is equal to `mini`, and if the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element in the list is equal to `mini`, `final` also contains the second element in `lst` and the third element in `lst` and `elem`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
