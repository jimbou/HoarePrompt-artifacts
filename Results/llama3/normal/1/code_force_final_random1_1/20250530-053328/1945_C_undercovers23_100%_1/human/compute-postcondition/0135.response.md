Output State: **_ is 2, t is greater than -1 and is an integer, n is an integer, s is a string, pk is an integer or a float**

In this output state, the value of `pk` is assigned the value of `n` divided by 2. The value of `n` is an integer, so the value of `pk` can be an integer or a float, depending on whether `n` is even or odd. The values of the other variables are not affected by the code.
