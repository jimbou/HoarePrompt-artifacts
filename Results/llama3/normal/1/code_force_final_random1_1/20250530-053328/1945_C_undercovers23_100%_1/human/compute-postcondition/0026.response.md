To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The only other object in the loop head is `n`, which is an integer that must be at least 3. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be at least 3 to ensure that the loop can execute again.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `_`, `stdin`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `lst`, `mini`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `zero`, and `one`, are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1, `pk` is an integer equal to `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise `pk` is an integer equal to `(n-1)/2`, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing the value `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is an integer equal to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is an integer equal to `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 2, `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise `one` is 0. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains the value `i + 1` which is 3. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**
