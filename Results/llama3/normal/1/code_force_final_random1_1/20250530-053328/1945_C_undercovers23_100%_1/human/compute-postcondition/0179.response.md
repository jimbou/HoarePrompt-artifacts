The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list lst, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lst.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, lst has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the elem is the third element in the list.
State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `i` is n-2, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing at least 3 values, `ele` is the third element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the previous minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then `final` contains the first element in `lst` and `elem`.**
