To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0 after the decrement.

Since `_` is the loop variable, its value will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1**
