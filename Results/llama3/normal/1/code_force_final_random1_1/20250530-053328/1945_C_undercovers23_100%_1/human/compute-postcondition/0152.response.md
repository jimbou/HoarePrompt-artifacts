Output State: **_ is 2, t is greater than -6 and decremented by 1, n is greater than 2, s is a string, sl is a list of characters in s, o is the number of '1's in s, z is the number of '0's in s, zero is 1 if the character at index i of s is '0', otherwise zero is 0, one is 1 if the character at index i of s is not '0', otherwise one is 0, i is 1, zero_perc is the value of zero * 100 // (i + 1), one_perc is the value of (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1), lst is a list containing the value i + 1 if the current value of zero_perc is greater than or equal to 50 and the current value of one_perc is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise lst is an empty list, mini is 100000000.**

In this output state, the values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet. The values of `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are updated based on the current values of `zero`, `one`, `i`, `o`, and `n`. The value of `lst` and `mini` are also updated based on the conditions specified in the precondition.
