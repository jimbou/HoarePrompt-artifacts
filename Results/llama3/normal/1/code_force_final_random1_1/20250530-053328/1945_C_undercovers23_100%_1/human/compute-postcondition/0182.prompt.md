Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 2, `t` is greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `i` is `n-2`, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing at least three values, including `i + 1`, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the previous minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, and `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program has executed the if-else block, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `_` is 2, `t` is greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `i` is n-2, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing at least one value, `ele` is the last element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the previous minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, and `final` is a list. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then `final` contains the first element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is 2, `t` is greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `sl` is a list of characters in `s`, `o` is the number of '1's in `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `s`, `zero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `one` is the number of '1's in `s`, `i` is n-2, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is a list containing at least 2 values, `ele` is the second element in `lst`, `mini` is the minimum of the previous minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then `final` contains the first element in `lst` and `elem`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program maintains its initial state with `_` equal to 2, `t` greater than -n-1 and decremented by 1, `n` as an integer, `s` as a string, `sl` as a list of characters in `s`, `o` and `z` as the counts of '1's and '0's in `s` respectively, `zero` and `one` as the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` respectively, `i` as n-2, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` greater than or equal to 50, `lst` as a list containing at least 3 values, `ele` as the third element in `lst`, and `mini` as the minimum of the previous minimum of 100000000 and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Additionally, if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` contains the first element in `lst`, `elem`, and the newly appended `elem`. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
