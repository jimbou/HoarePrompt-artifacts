Output State: **t is greater than 0, _ is 0, t is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1, n is an integer, s is a string of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1, n is odd, pk is an integer equal to (n-1)/2**

In this output state, the value of pk is calculated as n / 2, but since n is odd, the result is an integer equal to (n-1)/2. The values of the other variables are not affected by the code.
