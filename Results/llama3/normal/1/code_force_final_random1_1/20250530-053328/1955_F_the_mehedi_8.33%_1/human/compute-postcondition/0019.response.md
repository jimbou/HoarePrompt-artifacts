Output State: **`a` is a list of 5 integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `a`, `cnt` is either `math.floor(x / 2)` or `1 + math.floor(x / 2)`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its previous value. The previous value of `cnt` was either 0 or 1, depending on whether the first three elements of `a` were equal and odd. If `cnt` was 0, its new value is `math.floor(x / 2)`. If `cnt` was 1, its new value is `1 + math.floor(x / 2)`. The values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged, and the stdin is now empty since the input has been consumed.
