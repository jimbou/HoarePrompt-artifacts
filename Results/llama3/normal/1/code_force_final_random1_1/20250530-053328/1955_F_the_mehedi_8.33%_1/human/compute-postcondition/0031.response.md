To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of 5 integers, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, and `x` is undefined. For the loop to be executed, `a` must have at least 1 element and `x` is the first element in the list.

State: **`a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1**
