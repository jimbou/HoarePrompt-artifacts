Output State: **`a` is a list of 5 integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `a`, `cnt` is either the third element of `a` plus `math.floor(x / 2)`, the third element of `a` plus 1 plus `math.floor(x / 2)` if the third element is even, or the third element of `a` minus 1 plus `math.floor(x / 2)` if the third element is odd, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` remains unchanged with 5 integers and at least 3 elements. The value of `x` is still the third element of `a`. The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the integer part of half of `x` to its previous value. The previous value of `cnt` was either the third element of `a`, the third element of `a` plus 1 if the third element is even, or the third element of `a` minus 1 if the third element is odd. The stdin remains empty.
