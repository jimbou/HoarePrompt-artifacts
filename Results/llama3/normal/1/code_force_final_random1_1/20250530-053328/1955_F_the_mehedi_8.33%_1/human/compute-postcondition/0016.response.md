Output State: **`a` is a list of 5 integers, `cnt` is 1, `x` is the fifth element of `a`, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains 5 integers, and `x` is still equal to the fifth element of `a`. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers as input.
