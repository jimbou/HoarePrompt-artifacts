The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cnt` is 0, so the new value of `cnt` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). The list `a` still contains 5 integers where the first three elements are equal, have the same value, and are odd.

Output State: **`cnt` is 1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `a` is a list of 5 integers where the first three elements are equal, have the same value, and are odd.**
