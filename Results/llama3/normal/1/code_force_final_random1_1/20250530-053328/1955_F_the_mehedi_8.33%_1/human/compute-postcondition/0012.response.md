The code prints the value of `cnt`, which is increased by the integer part of `x` divided by 2. Here, `x` is the fifth element of the list `a`. Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the updated value of `cnt` after the increment operation.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the value of cnt after being increased by the integer part of x divided by 2)**
