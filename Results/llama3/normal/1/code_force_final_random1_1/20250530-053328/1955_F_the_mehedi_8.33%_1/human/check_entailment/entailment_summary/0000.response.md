Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

The program first checks if all four elements are equal and odd. If they are, it increments the count by 1, because in this case, Bob can win once by removing one of the numbers.

Then, for each element in the list, it calculates the integer division of the element by 2 and adds it to the count. This is because each pair of numbers with the same value can result in a win for Bob if Eve removes one of the numbers.

The program then prints the total count, which represents the maximum number of times Bob can win.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading the input lines, calculating the sum of the integer divisions, and adding 1 to the sum if all four elements are equal and odd.

Correctness: **True**
