Output State: **a is a list of 5 integers, cnt is 0, x is the fifth element of a, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**

In this final state, the value of `a` has been updated to a new list of 5 integers, which are the input values from stdin. The value of `cnt` remains 0, as it was initialized to 0 and not modified by the code. The value of `x` is still the fifth element of the updated list `a`. Stdin now contains only 1 input, which is a space-separated list of integers.
