Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The key insight is that Bob wins when the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The program correctly calculates the number of times Bob can win by considering the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.

The program first checks if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are equal and odd, in which case Bob can win once. Then, it calculates the number of times Bob can win by dividing each count by 2 and summing them up. This is because each pair of numbers with the same value can be removed to make the XOR zero.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the counts are zero or very large. The use of `math.floor` ensures that the division by 2 is done correctly, even when the count is odd.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
