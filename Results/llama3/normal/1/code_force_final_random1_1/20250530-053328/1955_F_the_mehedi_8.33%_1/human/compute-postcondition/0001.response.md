Output State: **stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), a is a list of 5 integers, cnt is 0**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the state of the program has changed as follows: the variable `a` now holds a list of 5 integers, which were read from the first line of the input. The variable `cnt` has been initialized to 0. The input stream `stdin` now contains `t-1` lines, each with four integers `p_i`, since the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The value of `t` is still present in `stdin`, but it is no longer the first item. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0.
