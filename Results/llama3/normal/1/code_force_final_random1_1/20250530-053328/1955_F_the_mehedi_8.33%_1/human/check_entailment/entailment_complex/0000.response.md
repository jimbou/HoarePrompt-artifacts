Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each line separately.
2. For each line, it calculates the sum of the integer divisions of each element by 2, which is the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. This is because each pair of identical numbers can be removed to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero.
3. The program also correctly handles the case where all four elements are equal and odd. In this case, it adds 1 to the sum, because Eve can remove one number to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy for maximizing Bob's wins.

Correctness: **True**
