Output State: **`a` is a list of 5 integers, `x` is the fifth element of `a`, `cnt` is the sum of the integer divisions of each element in `a` by 2, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` remains unchanged, `x` becomes the last element of `a`, and `cnt` accumulates the sum of the integer divisions of each element in `a` by 2. The stdin remains empty as no new input is provided during the loop's execution.
