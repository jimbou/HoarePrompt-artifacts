The code prints the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of the integer divisions of each element in the list `a` by 2.
Since the exact elements of the list `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum.
Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of the integer divisions of each element in the list a by 2)**
