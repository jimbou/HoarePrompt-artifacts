The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin.  If the stdin has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). So for the loop to be executed  the stdin must have at least 1 integer and the _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), _ is 0**
