To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the first element of `a`, and `a` is a list of 5 integers that must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` must be the second element of `a`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`a` is a list of 5 integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `a`, `cnt` is either `math.floor(x / 2)` or `1 + math.floor(x / 2)`, stdin contains no input.**
