The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 integers, x is the second element in the list a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the x is the third element in the list.
State: **`a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `cnt` is either `math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2)` or `math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2) + 1**
