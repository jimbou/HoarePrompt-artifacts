Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly identifies whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle based on the count of '1's in the first two rows. If the counts are equal, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise it prints 'TRIANGLE'. This logic is consistent with the problem description, which states that a square has k consecutive characters '1' in each row, while a triangle has 2*i-1 consecutive characters '1' in the i-th row.

Correctness: **True**
