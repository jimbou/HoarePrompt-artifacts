Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

*   The program reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case.
*   For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input, each containing `n` characters '0' or '1'.
*   It counts the number of '1's in each line and stores them in the list `k`, but only if the line contains at least one '1'. This is done to ignore lines that do not contain any '1's.
*   The program then checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal. If they are equal, it prints 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

The reasoning behind this logic is as follows:

*   If the shape is a square, the number of '1's in each row will be the same, which means the first two elements of `k` will be equal.
*   If the shape is a triangle, the number of '1's in each row will increase or decrease by 2 (depending on whether it's an upside-down triangle or not), which means the first two elements of `k` will not be equal.

Therefore, the program correctly identifies whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the count of '1's in each row.

Correctness: **True**
