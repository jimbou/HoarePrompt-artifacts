Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. It only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows is equal, which is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.

For example, consider the following input:

    4
    0000
    0000
    0100
    1110

The program will output "TRIANGLE", but the correct output is "SQUARE". This is because the program does not check if the '1's in the third row are at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid, which is a necessary condition for a square.

To correctly identify the shape, the program needs to check the position of the '1's in each row, not just the number of '1's.
