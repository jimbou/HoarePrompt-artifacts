Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is not in both `a` and `b`. Additionally, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`***
