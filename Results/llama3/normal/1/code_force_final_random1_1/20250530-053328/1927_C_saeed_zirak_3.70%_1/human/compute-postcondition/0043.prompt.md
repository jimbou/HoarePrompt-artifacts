Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, and k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, aOnes is 0, bOnes is 0, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2 rounded down, i is 1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. The current value of `i` is 2. If both `a` and `b` contain the value 1, then either `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 0, or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1, with `aOnes` being less than `bOnes`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1. Otherwise, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, and either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `k` is greater than or equal to 3. The current value of `i` is 3. If both `a` and `b` contain the value 1, then either `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 0, or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1, with `aOnes` being less than `bOnes`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` is either 1 or 2, and `bOnes` is either 1 or increased by 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, or if `aOnes` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The current value of `i` is 4. If both `a` and `b` contain the value 1, then either `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 0, or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1, with `aOnes` being less than `bOnes`.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
