Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains no input. The current value of `i` is in both `a` and `b`. The current value of `aOnes` is equal to the current value of `bOnes`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `t`, and `stdin` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `aOnes` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The value of `bOnes` remains 0. The current value of `i` is still in both `a` and `b`. Now, the value of `aOnes` is equal to the value of `bOnes`.
