Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included.

The program iterates over the range from 1 to k and checks if the current number is present in both arrays. If it is, it increments the count of the array with the smaller count. If the number is present in only one array, it increments the count of that array if the count is less than or equal to k/2. If the number is not present in either array, it breaks the loop.

After the loop, it checks if the counts of both arrays are equal to k/2. If they are, it prints 'yes', indicating that it is possible to choose the elements in the required way. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
