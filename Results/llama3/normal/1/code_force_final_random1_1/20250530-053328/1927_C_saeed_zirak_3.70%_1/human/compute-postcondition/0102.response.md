The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `t` must be 2.
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is `k` + 1, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `newk`, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains no input. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.**
