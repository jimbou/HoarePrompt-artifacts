Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains no input. The current value of `i` is 1 and it is present in both list `a` and list `b`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes` and `bOnes` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`***
