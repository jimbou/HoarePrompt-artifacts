Output: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is equal to `k` plus 1, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains no input. `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers, where `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`. Either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk` or both, and 'no' is printed**
