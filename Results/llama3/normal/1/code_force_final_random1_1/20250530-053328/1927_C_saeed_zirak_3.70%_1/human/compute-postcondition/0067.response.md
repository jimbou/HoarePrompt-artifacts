Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `t` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. Additionally, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`. Either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
