Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is not in both `a` and `b`. Additionally, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`. The current value of `i` is in `b` and the current value of `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`**

In natural language, the output state is: All the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `aOnes`, `newk`, `i`, `k`, and `stdin` have the same values as before. The only change is that `bOnes` has been incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. The conditions that `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, the current value of `i` is in `b`, and the current value of `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk` are still valid.
