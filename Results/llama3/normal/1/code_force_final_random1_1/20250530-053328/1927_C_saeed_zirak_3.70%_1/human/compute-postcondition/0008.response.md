Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `i` is 1. Both `a` and `b` contain the value 1. Either `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 0, or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1, with `aOnes` being less than `bOnes`***
