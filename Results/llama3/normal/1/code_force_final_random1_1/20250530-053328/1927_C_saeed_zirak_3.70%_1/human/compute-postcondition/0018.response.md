Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `stdin` is empty. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is 1. Otherwise, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, and either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
