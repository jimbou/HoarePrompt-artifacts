Output: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is equal to `k` plus 1, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains no input. The current values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`, where previously `aOnes` was less than or equal to `newk` and `bOnes` was less than or equal to `newk`, and 'yes' is being printed**
