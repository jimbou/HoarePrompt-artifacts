Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, and k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2 rounded down, i is 1, aOnes is 0, bOnes is 0, t is 2, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 2, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` are set to 1 and 0, or 0 and 1, respectively, based on the comparison of `aOnes` and `bOnes`. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is set to 1; if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is set to 1; otherwise, either `aOnes` or `bOnes` is larger than `newk`, or the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is less than or equal to `k` and increased by 1, `t` is 2, and `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` are set to 1 and 0, or 0 and 1, respectively, based on the comparison of `aOnes` and `bOnes`. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is set to 1; if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is set to 1; otherwise, either `aOnes` or `bOnes` is larger than `newk`, or the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `t` is 2, and `stdin` contains no input. If `i-1` is in both `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` are set to 1 and 0, or 0 and 1, respectively, based on the comparison of `aOnes` and `bOnes`. If `i-1` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i-1` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is set to 1; if `i-1` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is set to 1; otherwise, either `aOnes` or `bOnes` is larger than `newk`, or the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, and `bOnes` is either 1 or more than 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
