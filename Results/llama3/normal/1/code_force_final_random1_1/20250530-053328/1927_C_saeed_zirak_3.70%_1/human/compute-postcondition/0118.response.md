Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `t` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, Either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is larger than `newk`. Either `i` is not in `b` or `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is larger than `newk`.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The conditions on `i`, `a`, `b`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, and `newk` are still valid.
