Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is `k` + 1, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `newk`, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains no input. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.***
