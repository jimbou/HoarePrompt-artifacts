The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is the integer read from stdin, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is at least 1.
State: **stdin contains an integer `t` that is at least 1**
