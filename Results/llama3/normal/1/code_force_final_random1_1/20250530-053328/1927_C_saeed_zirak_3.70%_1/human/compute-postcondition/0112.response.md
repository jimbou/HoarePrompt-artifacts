Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains no input. Either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. The current value of `i` is in `a` and the current value of `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`***
