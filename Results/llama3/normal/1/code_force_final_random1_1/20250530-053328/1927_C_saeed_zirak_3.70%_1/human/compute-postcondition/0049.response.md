Output: **n, m, and k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2 rounded down, i is equal to k + 1, aOnes is either equal to newk or less than newk and bOnes is either equal to newk or less than newk. Either aOnes is not equal to newk or bOnes is not equal to newk or both, and 'no' is printed**
