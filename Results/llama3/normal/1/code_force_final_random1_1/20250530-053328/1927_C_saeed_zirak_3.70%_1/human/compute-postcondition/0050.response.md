Postcondition: ***n, m, and k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2 rounded down, i is equal to k + 1, aOnes is either equal to newk or less than newk and bOnes is either equal to newk or less than newk. If aOnes is equal to newk and bOnes is equal to newk, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.***
