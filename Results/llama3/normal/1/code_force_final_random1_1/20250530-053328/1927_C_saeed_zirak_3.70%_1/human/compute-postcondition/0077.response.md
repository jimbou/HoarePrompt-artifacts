Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 2, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes` and `bOnes` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 2, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. If `i` is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, then if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is 2, otherwise `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `bOnes` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for `aOnes` and `bOnes` have been updated accordingly.
