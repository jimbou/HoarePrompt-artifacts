Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is less than or equal to `k-1`, `t` is 2, and `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, and `bOnes` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, if `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` are set to 1 and 0, or 0 and 1, respectively, based on the comparison of `aOnes` and `bOnes`. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is set to 1; if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is set to 1; otherwise, either `aOnes` or `bOnes` is larger than `newk`, or the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
