#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_j <= 10^6).
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        aOnes = 0
        
        bOnes = 0
        
        newk = k // 2
        
        i = 1
        
        while i <= k:
            if i in a and i in b:
                if aOnes < bOnes:
                    aOnes += 1
                else:
                    bOnes += 1
            elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
                aOnes += 1
            elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
                bOnes += 1
            else:
                break
            i += 1
        
        if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: `t` is equal to the initial value of `t` (the number of test cases), `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is equal to `k` plus 1, `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers, where `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `stdin` contains no input. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and determines whether it's possible to make two lists of integers, a and b, have the same number of ones (up to a certain limit k) by incrementing elements in both lists. It prints 'yes' if possible and 'no' otherwise.
