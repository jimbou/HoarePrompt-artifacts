Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is less than or equal to `k-1`, `t` is 2, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 1 or 2, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `bOnes` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
