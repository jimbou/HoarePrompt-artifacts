Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_j <= 10^6).
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
        elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n, m, and k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2 rounded down, i is equal to k + 1, aOnes is either equal to newk or less than newk and bOnes is either equal to newk or less than newk. If aOnes is equal to newk and bOnes is equal to newk, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is `k` + 1, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `newk`, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains no input. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is equal to `k` plus 1, `t` is 2, `stdin` contains no input. `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers, where `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
