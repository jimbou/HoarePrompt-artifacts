Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 3, `t` is 1, `aOnes` is increased by 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 depending on the previous conditions, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is either 1 or 2, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. If `i` is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, then if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is either 1 or 2, otherwise `bOnes` is either 0 or 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that `aOnes` has been incremented by 1, and the conditions regarding the presence of `i` in lists `a` and `b` and the values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` are still valid. The other variables remain unchanged.
