Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, and k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2 rounded down, i is 1, aOnes is 0, bOnes is 0, t is 1, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 2, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes` and `bOnes` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. If `i` is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, then if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is 1, otherwise `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 3, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is increased by 1 and `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 depending on the previous conditions. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is either 1 or 2, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. If `i` is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, then if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is either 1 or 2, otherwise `bOnes` is either 0 or 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers and `k` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 4, `t` is 1, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is increased by 1 and `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 depending on the previous conditions. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is either 1 or 2, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. If `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, then if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is either 1 or 2, otherwise `bOnes` is either 0 or 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
