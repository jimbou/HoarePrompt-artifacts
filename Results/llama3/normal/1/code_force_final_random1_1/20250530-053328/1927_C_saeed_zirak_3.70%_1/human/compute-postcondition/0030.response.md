Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `k` is greater than or equal to 3. The current value of `i` is 2. If both `a` and `b` contain the value 1, then either `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 0, or `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1, with `aOnes` being less than `bOnes`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` is either 1 or 2, and `bOnes` is either 1 or increased by 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, or if `aOnes` or `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
