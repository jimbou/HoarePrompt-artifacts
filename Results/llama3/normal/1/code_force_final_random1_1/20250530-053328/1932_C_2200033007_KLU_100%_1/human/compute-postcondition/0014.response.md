Postcondition: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. b is a list containing two elements from a. If s[i] is 'L', then b contains the first element of a and the element at index l of a if the first character of s is 'L', or the last element of a and the element at index l of a if the first character of s is 'R', l is either 3 if the first character of s is 'L' and s[i] is 'L', or 2 if the first character of s is 'L' and s[i] is 'R', or 2 if the first character of s is 'R' and s[i] is 'L', or 1 if the first character of s is 'R' and s[i] is 'R', and r is either n - 1 if the first character of s is 'L' and s[i] is 'L', or n - 2 if the first character of s is 'L' and s[i] is 'R', or n - 2 if the first character of s is 'R' and s[i] is 'L', or n - 3 if the first character of s is 'R' and s[i] is 'R'. If s[i] is 'R', then b contains two elements from a, l is either 1 or 2, and r is either n - 2 or n - 3. In all cases, i is 2.**
