Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n positive integers, l is n, r is -1, i is n, ans is a list containing two elements: the original value of p and the new value of p, p is the value of p * v * v % m, v is the second-to-last element of the list b.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `l`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `p` is updated to be the result of `p * v * v % m`, where `v` is the second-to-last element of the list `b`. The list `ans` now contains two elements: the original value of `p` and the new value of `p`.
