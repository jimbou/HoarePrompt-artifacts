Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. The `func_1` function rearranges the elements of the array `a` based on the commands in the string `s`. It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to keep track of the current position in the array from the left and right respectively. This is done correctly.
3. After rearranging the elements, the program calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged elements modulo `m`. This is also done correctly.
4. Finally, the program returns the result in reverse order, which is also correct.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
