The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. If the first character of s is 'L', then b is a list containing the first element of a and the element at index l of a, l is 2, and r is n - 1. If the first character of s is 'R', then b is a list containing the last element of a and the element at index l of a, l is 1, and r is n - 2. If the first character of s is 'L' and s[i] is 'L', then b is a list containing the first element of a and the element at index l of a, l is 2, and r is n - 1. If the first character of s is 'L' and s[i] is 'R', then b is a list containing the first element of a and the element of a at index r+1, l is 1, and r is n - 2. If the first character of s is 'R' and s[i] is 'L', then b is a list containing the last element of a and the element at index l of a, l is 1, and r is n - 2. If the first character of s is 'R' and s[i] is 'R', then b is a list containing the last element of a and the element of a at index r+1, l is 0, and r is n - 3. In all cases, i is 2.**
