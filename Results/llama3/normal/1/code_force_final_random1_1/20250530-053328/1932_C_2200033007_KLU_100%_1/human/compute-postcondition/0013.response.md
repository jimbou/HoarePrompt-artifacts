Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing two elements from a, l is either 1 or 2, and r is either n - 2 or n - 3.**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 2. The value of `m` also remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list `a` remains a list of `n` positive integers. The string `s` remains a string of `n` characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'.

The list `b` now contains three elements from `a`. If the first character of `s` is 'L', then `b` contains the first element of `a`, the element at index `l` of `a`, and the element at index `r` of `a`. If the first character of `s` is 'R', then `b` contains the last element of `a`, the element at index `l` of `a`, and the element at index `r` of `a`. The value of `l` is either 1 or 2, and the value of `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.
