Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list of n positive integers, l is n, r is -1, i is n, ans is a list containing three elements: the original value of p, the new value of p, and the updated value of p, p is the value of p * v * v % m, v is the third-to-last element of the list b**

The code snippet modifies the values of `p` and `ans`. The first line updates the value of `p` by multiplying it with `v` and taking the modulus `m`. The second line appends the updated value of `p` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
