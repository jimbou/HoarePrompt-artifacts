Functionality: **This function takes in a list of positive integers 'a', a string 's' of the same length as 'a' containing 'L' and 'R' characters, and a positive integer 'm'. It rearranges the elements of 'a' based on the characters in 's', with 'L' indicating the next element should be taken from the left of 'a' and 'R' indicating the next element should be taken from the right. It then calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged elements modulo 'm' and returns the result in reverse order.**
