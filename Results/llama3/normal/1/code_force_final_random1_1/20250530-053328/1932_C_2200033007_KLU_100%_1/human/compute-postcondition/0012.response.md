Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R', b is a list containing the first element of a and the element at index l of a if the first character of s is 'L', or the last element of a and the element at index l of a if the first character of s is 'R', l is 3 if the first character of s is 'L' and s[i] is 'L', or 2 if the first character of s is 'L' and s[i] is 'R', or 2 if the first character of s is 'R' and s[i] is 'L', or 1 if the first character of s is 'R' and s[i] is 'R', r is n - 1 if the first character of s is 'L' and s[i] is 'L', or n - 2 if the first character of s is 'L' and s[i] is 'R', or n - 2 if the first character of s is 'R' and s[i] is 'L', or n - 3 if the first character of s is 'R' and s[i] is 'R', i is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 2. The value of `m` also remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list `a` remains a list of `n` positive integers. The string `s` remains a string of `n` characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. The list `b` is updated to contain the first element of `a` and the element at index `l` of `a` if the first character of `s` is 'L', or the last element of `a` and the element at index `l` of `a` if the first character of `s` is 'R'. The value of `l` is updated to 3 if the first character of `s` is 'L' and `s[i]` is 'L', or 2 if the first character of `s` is 'L' and `s[i]` is 'R', or 2 if the first character of `s` is 'R' and `s[i]` is 'L', or 1 if the first character of `s` is 'R' and `s[i]` is 'R'. The value of `r` is updated to `n - 1` if the first character of `s` is 'L' and `s[i]` is 'L', or `n - 2` if the first character of `s` is 'L' and `s[i]` is 'R', or `n - 2` if the first character of `s` is 'R' and `s[i]` is 'L', or `n - 3` if the first character of `s` is 'R' and `s[i]` is 'R'. The value of `i` remains unchanged as 2.
