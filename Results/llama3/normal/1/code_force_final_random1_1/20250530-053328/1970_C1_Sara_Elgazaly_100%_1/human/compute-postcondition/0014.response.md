Output State: **x is 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list and lst[a] is a list containing all the values of b and lst[tmp] is a list containing at least one value but one less than before, rev is a dictionary with default value of empty list and rev[b] is a list containing all the values of a, z is an integer, tmp is an integer equal to the last value in lst[tmp], one is False, stdin contains no lines.**

Explanation:

The first line of code, `one = not one`, changes the value of `one` from True to False.

The second line of code, `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()`, removes the last element from the list `lst[tmp]` and assigns it to `tmp`. Since `tmp` was previously equal to the second last value in `lst[tmp]`, it is now equal to the last value in `lst[tmp]`. The list `lst[tmp]` now contains one less value than before.

All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still 1, the value of `y` is still 1, the dictionary `lst` still has the same default value and the same values for `lst[a]` and `lst[tmp]`, the dictionary `rev` still has the same default value and the same values for `rev[b]`, the value of `z` is still an integer, and `stdin` still contains no lines.
