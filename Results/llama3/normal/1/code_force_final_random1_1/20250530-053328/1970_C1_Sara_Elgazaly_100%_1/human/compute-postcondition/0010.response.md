Output State: **x is 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list and lst[a] is a list containing all the values of b and lst[tmp] is a list containing one less value than before, rev is a dictionary with default value of empty list and rev[b] is a list containing all the values of a, z is an integer, tmp is an integer equal to the last value in lst[tmp], one is False, stdin contains no lines.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `x` remains unchanged at 1, and the value of `y` also remains unchanged at 1. The dictionary `lst` still has a default value of an empty list, and `lst[a]` still contains all the values of `b`. However, `lst[tmp]` now contains one less value than before because one value was popped from it. The dictionary `rev` still has a default value of an empty list, and `rev[b]` still contains all the values of `a`. The value of `z` remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `tmp` is now equal to the last value that was in `lst[tmp]`, which was popped from the list. The value of `one` is now False because it was negated. The stdin still contains no lines.
