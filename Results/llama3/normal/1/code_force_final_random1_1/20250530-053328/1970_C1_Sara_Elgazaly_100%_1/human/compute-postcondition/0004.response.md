Output State: **x is an integer at least 3, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list and lst[a] is a list containing b and the original value of lst[a], rev is a dictionary with default value of empty list and rev[b] is a list containing a and the original value of rev[b], stdin contains n-3 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one line containing one integer u**

In this output state, the value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `y` also remains the same. The dictionary `lst` has its default value unchanged, but the list at key `a` now contains the original value of `lst[a]` and the new value `b`. Similarly, the dictionary `rev` has its default value unchanged, but the list at key `b` now contains the original value of `rev[b]` and the new value `a`. The stdin now contains `n-3` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and finally one line containing one integer `u`, as two lines have been consumed by the `input()` function.
