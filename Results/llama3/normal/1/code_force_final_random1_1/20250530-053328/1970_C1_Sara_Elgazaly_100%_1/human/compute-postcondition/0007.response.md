Output State: **x is an integer equal to 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list and lst[a] is a list containing all the values of b, rev is a dictionary with default value of empty list and rev[b] is a list containing all the values of a, stdin contains no lines.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the value of x is 1, the value of y remains unchanged at 1, the dictionary lst contains all the values of b for each key a, the dictionary rev contains all the values of a for each key b, and the stdin contains no lines as all the input lines have been processed.
