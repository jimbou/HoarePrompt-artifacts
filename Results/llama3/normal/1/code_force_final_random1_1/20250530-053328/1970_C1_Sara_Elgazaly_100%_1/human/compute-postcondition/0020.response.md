According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable rev[tmp].  If rev[tmp] is not equal to an empty list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, rev[tmp] is a list containing all the values of a minus one value, So for the loop to be executed one more time rev[tmp] must contain at least one value.
State: **x is 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list and lst[a] is a list containing all the values of b, rev is a dictionary with default value of empty list and rev[b] is a list containing at least one value of a, z is equal to b, tmp is an integer equal to one value of a, two is False, one is True, stdin contains no lines.**
