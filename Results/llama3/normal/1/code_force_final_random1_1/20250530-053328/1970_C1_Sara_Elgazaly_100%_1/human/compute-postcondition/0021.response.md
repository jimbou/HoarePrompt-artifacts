Output State: **x is 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list and lst[a] is a list containing all the values of b, rev is a dictionary with default value of empty list and rev[b] is a list containing at least one value of a, z is equal to b, tmp is an integer equal to one value of a, two is True, one is True, stdin contains no lines.**

Explanation:

The first line of the code, `two = not two`, changes the value of `two` from `False` to `True`. This is because the `not` operator inverts the boolean value of its operand.

The second line, `tmp = rev[tmp].pop()`, modifies the value of `tmp`. Initially, `tmp` is an integer equal to one value of `a`. The expression `rev[tmp]` accesses the list of values associated with `tmp` in the `rev` dictionary. The `pop()` method removes and returns the last element from this list. Since `rev[b]` is a list containing at least one value of `a`, and `tmp` is one value of `a`, `rev[tmp]` is not empty. Therefore, `tmp` is assigned the last element of the list `rev[tmp]`, which is one value of `a`.

The other variables, `x`, `y`, `lst`, `z`, and `one`, are not modified by the code. The `lst` and `rev` dictionaries remain unchanged, except for the removal of one element from the list `rev[tmp]`. The `stdin` remains empty, as there are no input operations in the code.

In summary, the code changes the value of `two` to `True` and updates the value of `tmp` to one value of `a` by removing and returning an element from the list `rev[tmp]`. The other variables and data structures remain unchanged.
