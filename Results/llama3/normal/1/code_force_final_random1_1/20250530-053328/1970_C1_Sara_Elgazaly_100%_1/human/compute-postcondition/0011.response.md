According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable lst[tmp]. If lst[tmp] is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, lst[tmp] is a list containing one less value than before. So for the loop to be executed one more time lst[tmp] must not be empty.

State: **x is 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list and lst[a] is a list containing all the values of b and lst[tmp] is a list containing at least one value, rev is a dictionary with default value of empty list and rev[b] is a list containing all the values of a, z is an integer, tmp is an integer equal to the last value in lst[tmp], one is False, stdin contains no lines.**
