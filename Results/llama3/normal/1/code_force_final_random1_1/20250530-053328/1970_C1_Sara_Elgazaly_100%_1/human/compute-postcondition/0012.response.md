Output State: **x is 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list and lst[a] is a list containing all the values of b and lst[tmp] is a list containing at least one value but one less than before, rev is a dictionary with default value of empty list and rev[b] is a list containing all the values of a, z is an integer, tmp is an integer equal to the second last value in lst[tmp], one is True, stdin contains no lines.**

In this output state, the value of `one` has been toggled from `False` to `True`. The value of `tmp` has been updated to the second last value in `lst[tmp]` after popping the last value. The size of `lst[tmp]` has been reduced by one. All other variables remain unchanged.
