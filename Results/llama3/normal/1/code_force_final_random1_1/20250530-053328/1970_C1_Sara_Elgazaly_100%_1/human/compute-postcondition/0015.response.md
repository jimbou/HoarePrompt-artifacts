Output State: x is 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list and lst[a] is a list containing all the values of b and lst[tmp] is an empty list, rev is a dictionary with default value of empty list and rev[b] is a list containing all the values of a, z is an integer, tmp is an integer equal to the last value in lst[tmp], one is True, stdin contains no lines.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of tmp and one. The loop continues to execute until lst[tmp] is empty, at which point it stops. Since lst[tmp] is initially a list containing all the values of b, the loop will execute until all values of b have been popped from the list. After the loop finishes, tmp will be equal to the last value in lst[tmp], which is the last value of b. The value of one will be True, since it is toggled in each iteration of the loop and the loop executes an even number of times (since lst[tmp] is initially a list containing all the values of b).
