The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, x must be decreased by 1, so x is at least 2.
State: **x is an integer at least 2, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list and lst[a] is a list containing b and the original value of lst[a], rev is a dictionary with default value of empty list and rev[b] is a list containing a and the original value of rev[b], stdin contains n-2 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one line containing one integer u**
