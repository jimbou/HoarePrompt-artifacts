To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for _ in range(x - 1):`. The only variable in the loop head is `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than 2.

State: **`x` is an integer at least 3, `y` is 1, `lst` is a dictionary with default value of empty list and `lst[a]` is a list containing `b`, `rev` is a dictionary with default value of empty list and `rev[b]` is a list containing `a`, `stdin` contains `n-2` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and finally one line containing one integer `u`**
