Output State: **x is an integer equal to the first input integer n, y is an integer equal to 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list, rev is a dictionary with default value of empty list, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and finally one line containing one integer u.**

Explanation:

The first line of the code assigns the first two input integers to `x` and `y` respectively. Since `y` is assigned the value of the second input integer, which is 1, `y` becomes 1. The value of `x` is assigned the value of the first input integer `n`, which is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5.

The second and third lines of the code create two dictionaries, `lst` and `rev`, with default values of empty lists. These dictionaries are initially empty and do not contain any key-value pairs.

The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, as the code does not consume any input from `stdin` beyond the first two integers. Therefore, `stdin` still contains `n-1` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and finally one line containing one integer `u`.

In summary, the code assigns values to `x` and `y`, creates two empty dictionaries `lst` and `rev`, and leaves the state of `stdin` unchanged.
