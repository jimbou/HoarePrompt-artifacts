Output State: **x is 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list and lst[a] is a list containing all the values of b, rev is a dictionary with default value of empty list and rev[b] is a list containing all the values of a minus one value, z is equal to b, tmp is an integer equal to one value of a, two is False, one is True, stdin contains no lines.**

In this output state, the value of `two` has been changed to `False` because of the first line of code. The second line of code has removed one value from the list `rev[tmp]` (which is equivalent to `rev[b]`) and assigned it to `tmp`. Since `tmp` was equal to `z` and `z` is equal to `b`, `tmp` now holds one value of `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
