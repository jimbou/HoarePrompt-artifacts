Output State: **x is 1, y is 1, lst is a dictionary with default value of empty list and lst[a] is a list containing all the values of b, rev is a dictionary with default value of empty list and rev[b] is a list containing all the values of a, z is an integer, tmp is an integer equal to z, one is True, stdin contains no lines.**

The code block starts by reading an integer from stdin and assigning it to `z`. Since stdin contains no lines, this operation will not modify the state of stdin. The second line assigns the value of `z` to `tmp`, making `tmp` equal to the value of `z`. The third line assigns `True` to `one`, making `one` equal to `True`. No other variables are affected by this code block.
