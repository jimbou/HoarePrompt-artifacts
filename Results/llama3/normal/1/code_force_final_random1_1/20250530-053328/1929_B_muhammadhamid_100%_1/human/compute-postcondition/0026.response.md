Output State: **_ is 2, `n` is an integer at least 2, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged as 2. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the two integers read from the input, where `n` is at least 2. The stdin now contains at least one test case minus two inputs, as two inputs have been read and assigned to `n` and `k`.
