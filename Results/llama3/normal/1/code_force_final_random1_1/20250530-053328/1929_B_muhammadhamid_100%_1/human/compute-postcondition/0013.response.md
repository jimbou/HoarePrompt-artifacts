Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input. If `k` is 1, 1 is being printed, and we move to the next iteration of the loop. If the current value of `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the sum of `n` and `n-2`, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is being printed. Otherwise, if `k` is more than 2 * (n + (n - 2)), the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed.***
