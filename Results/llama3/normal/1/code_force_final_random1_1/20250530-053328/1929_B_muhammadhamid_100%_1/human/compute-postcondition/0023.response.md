Output: **_* is 1, n is an integer at least 2, k is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If k is 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration, and the integer division of k by 2 plus 1 is being printed**
