The code prints the value of `k // 2 + 1`, which is the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1.
Since `k` is an integer, the `//` operator performs integer division, which rounds down to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, the value of `k // 2` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `k/2`.
Adding 1 to this value gives the final result.
Output: **the integer division of k by 2 plus 1**
