Postcondition: ***_ is 1, n is an integer at least 2, k is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If k is 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. If k is less than or equal to 2 times the value of n plus the value of n minus 2, the ceiling of k divided by 2 is printed. Otherwise, the integer division of k by 2 plus 1 is printed.***
