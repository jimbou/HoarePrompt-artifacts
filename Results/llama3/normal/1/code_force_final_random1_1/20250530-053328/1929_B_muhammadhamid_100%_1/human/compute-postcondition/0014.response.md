The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`_` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input**
