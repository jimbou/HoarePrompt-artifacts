Postcondition: ***_ is 2, `n` is an integer at least 2, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs, and if `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the value of `n` plus `n` minus 2, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. Otherwise, the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed.***
