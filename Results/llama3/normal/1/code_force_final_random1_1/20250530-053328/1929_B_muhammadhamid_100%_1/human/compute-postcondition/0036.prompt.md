Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and k is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 4n - 2.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    else:
        print(k // 2 + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input. If `k` is 1, 1 is being printed, and we move to the next iteration of the loop. If the current value of `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the sum of `n` and `n-2`, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is being printed. Otherwise, if `k` is more than 2 * (n + (n - 2)), the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *_ is 1, n is an integer at least 2, k is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs. If k is 1, the number 1 is printed and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving to the next iteration. If k is less than or equal to 2 times the value of n plus the value of n minus 2, the ceiling of k divided by 2 is printed. Otherwise, the integer division of k by 2 plus 1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *_ is 2, `n` is an integer at least 2, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs, and if `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the value of `n` plus `n` minus 2, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. Otherwise, the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
