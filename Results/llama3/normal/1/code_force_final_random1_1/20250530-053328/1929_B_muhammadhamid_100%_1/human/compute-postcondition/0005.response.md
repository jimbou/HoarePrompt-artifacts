The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. The values of the variables `_`, `n`, and `k` are not affected. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus one input. The `1` is still being printed. 

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `k` is 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input, and 1 is being printed, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
