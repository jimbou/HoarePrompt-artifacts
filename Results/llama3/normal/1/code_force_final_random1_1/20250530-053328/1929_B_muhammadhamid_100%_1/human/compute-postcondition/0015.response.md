Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an integer at least 2, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged as 1. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers input from the standard input, where `n` is at least 2. The standard input now contains at least one test case minus two inputs, as two inputs have been consumed by the `input().split()` function.
