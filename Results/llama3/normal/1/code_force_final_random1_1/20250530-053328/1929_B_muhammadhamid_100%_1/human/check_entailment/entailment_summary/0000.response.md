Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n to have at least k diagonals with at least one colored cell.

The program handles the edge case where k is 1 by printing 1, as a single cell can cover one diagonal.

For k greater than 1, the program calculates the minimum number of cells needed based on the condition k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)). If k is within this range, it prints the ceiling of k divided by 2, which is the minimum number of cells needed to cover k diagonals.

If k is greater than 2 * (n + (n - 2)), the program prints the integer division of k by 2 plus 1. This is because in this case, it is not possible to cover all k diagonals with the minimum number of cells, so the program prints the next possible minimum number of cells.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes multiple test cases correctly and prints the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
