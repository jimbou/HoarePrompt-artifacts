Output: ** `_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input. If `k` is 1, 1 is being printed, and we move to the next iteration of the loop. The current value of `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the sum of `n` and `n-2`, and the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is being printed**
