Output State: **_ is the number of test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer at least 2, `k` is an integer, stdin contains no more input. If `k` is 1, the number 1 is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the value of `n` plus `n` minus 2, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. Otherwise, the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the number of test cases minus 1. The variables `n` and `k` will still be integers, with `n` being at least 2. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The loop will have printed the appropriate values for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
