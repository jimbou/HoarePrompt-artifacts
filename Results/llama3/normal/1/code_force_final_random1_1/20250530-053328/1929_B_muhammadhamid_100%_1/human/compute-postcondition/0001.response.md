Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input.**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `n` is assigned the first integer from the input, which is at least 1. The value of `k` is assigned the second integer from the input. The stdin still contains at least one test case, but one input has been consumed.
