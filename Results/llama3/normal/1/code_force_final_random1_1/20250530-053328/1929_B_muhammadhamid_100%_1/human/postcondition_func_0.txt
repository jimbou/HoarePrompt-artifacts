The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. For each test case, it prints a calculated value based on the values of n and k. If k is 1, it prints 1. If k is less than or equal to 2 times the value of n plus n minus 2, it prints the ceiling of k divided by 2. Otherwise, it prints the integer division of k by 2 plus 1. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty.
