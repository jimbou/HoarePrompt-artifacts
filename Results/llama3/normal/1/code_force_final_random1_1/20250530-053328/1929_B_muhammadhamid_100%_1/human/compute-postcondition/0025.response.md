The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the value returned by int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, n is an integer at least 2, k is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs. So for the loop to be executed one more time the value of _ must be increased by 1 and the stdin must contain at least one test case minus one input.
State: **_ is 2, n is an integer at least 2, k is an integer, stdin contains at least one test case minus one input**
