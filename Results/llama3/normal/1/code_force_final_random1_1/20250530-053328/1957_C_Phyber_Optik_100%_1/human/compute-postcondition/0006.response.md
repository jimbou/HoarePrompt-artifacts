The value of `dp[i]` is calculated using the values of `dp[i - 1]`, `dp[i - 2]`, and `i`. Since `i` is 5, `dp[i - 1]` is `dp[4]` which is 41, and `dp[i - 2]` is `dp[3]` which is 9. Therefore, `dp[i]` is `(41 + 2 * 4 * 9) % 1000000007` which is `(41 + 72) % 1000000007` which is `113 % 1000000007` which is 113.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 5, `i` is 5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 9, `dp[4]` is 41, `dp[5]` is 113**
