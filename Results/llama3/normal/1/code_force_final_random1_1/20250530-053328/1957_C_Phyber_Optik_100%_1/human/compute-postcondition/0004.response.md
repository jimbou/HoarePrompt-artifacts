Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 9, `dp[4]` is 41**.

In this output state, the value of `dp[4]` is calculated using the given formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Since `i` is 4, `dp[4]` is calculated as `(dp[3] + 2 * (4 - 1) * dp[2]) % 1000000007`, which is `(9 + 2 * 3 * 3) % 1000000007`, resulting in 41. The values of `n`, `i`, `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, and `dp[3]` remain unchanged.
