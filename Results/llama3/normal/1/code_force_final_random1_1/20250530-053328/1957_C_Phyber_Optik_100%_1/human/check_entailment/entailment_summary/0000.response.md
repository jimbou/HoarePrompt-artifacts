Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations for the chessboard game. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the Fibonacci-like sequence, which represents the number of possible configurations for a given number of remaining moves. The sequence is calculated modulo 10^9+7 to prevent overflow.

The program then uses this sequence to calculate the number of possible final configurations for the given chessboard size and number of moves. It subtracts the number of invalid moves (i.e., moves that would result in a rook attacking another rook) from the total number of moves to get the number of remaining moves. It then looks up the corresponding value in the Fibonacci-like sequence to get the number of possible final configurations.

The program handles the case where there are no remaining moves (i.e., the chessboard is full) by returning 1, which is the correct result in this case.

Correctness: **True**
