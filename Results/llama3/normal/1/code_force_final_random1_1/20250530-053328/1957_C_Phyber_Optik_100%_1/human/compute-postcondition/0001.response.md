According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer, `dp[1]` is 1, and `dp[2]` is 3. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 3 and `i` is now 3.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
