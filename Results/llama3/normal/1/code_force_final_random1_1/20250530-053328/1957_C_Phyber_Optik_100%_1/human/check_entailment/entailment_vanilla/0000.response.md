Reasoning:

The problem is asking us to determine the number of different final configurations possible when playing a game of rooks on a chessboard. The game starts with k moves already played, and we need to continue playing until there are no valid moves remaining.

The given program uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It first initializes a dp array of size 300007 with all elements set to -1. Then, it calls the function func_1(300000) to fill up the dp array.

The function func_1(n) calculates the number of different final configurations possible for a chessboard of size n. It uses the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007, where dp[i] represents the number of different final configurations possible for a chessboard of size i.

The main part of the program reads the input, which consists of the number of test cases t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, representing the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played, respectively. Then, it reads k pairs of integers r and c, representing the moves already played.

For each test case, the program calculates the number of invalid positions on the chessboard, which are the positions that have already been occupied by a rook. It then prints the maximum of 1 and dp[n - len(invalid)], which represents the number of different final configurations possible for the remaining valid positions on the chessboard.

The program uses the modulo operator to ensure that the result does not exceed 10^9+7.

Based on the problem description and the given program, it appears that the program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible for the remaining valid positions on the chessboard, taking into account the moves already played and the size of the chessboard.

Correctness: **True**
