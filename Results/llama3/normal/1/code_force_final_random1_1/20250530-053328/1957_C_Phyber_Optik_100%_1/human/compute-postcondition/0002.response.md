Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 9**

In this output state, the value of `dp[3]` has been calculated using the given formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Since `i` is 3, `dp[3]` is calculated as `(dp[2] + 2 * (3 - 1) * dp[1]) % 1000000007`, which simplifies to `(3 + 2 * 2 * 1) % 1000000007`, resulting in 9. The values of `n`, `i`, `dp[1]`, and `dp[2]` remain unchanged.
