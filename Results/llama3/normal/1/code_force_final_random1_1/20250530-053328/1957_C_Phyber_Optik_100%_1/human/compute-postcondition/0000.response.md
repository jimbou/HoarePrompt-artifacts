Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3**

The code snippet assigns specific values to `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`, making them 1 and 3, respectively. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The initial state of `n` being a non-negative integer is still valid after the execution of the code.
