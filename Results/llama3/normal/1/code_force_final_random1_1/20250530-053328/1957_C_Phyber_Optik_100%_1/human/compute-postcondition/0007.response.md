Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n`, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 9, `dp[4]` is 41, `dp[5]` is 113, and `dp[i]` is ((dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007) for all `i` from 6 to `n`.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `n` remains the same, the loop counter `i` has reached the value of `n`, and the values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` remain unchanged. The values of `dp[3]`, `dp[4]`, and `dp[5]` are also unchanged. For all `i` from 6 to `n`, the value of `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.
