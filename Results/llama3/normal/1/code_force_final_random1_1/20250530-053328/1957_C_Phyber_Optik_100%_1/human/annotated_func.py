#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n`, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 9, `dp[4]` is 41, `dp[5]` is 113, and `dp[i]` is ((dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007) for all `i` from 6 to `n`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous number and twice the product of the second previous number and its index, modulo 1000000007, and stores the results in the dp array.
