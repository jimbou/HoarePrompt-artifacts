To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, it must also be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.

The states of `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, and `dp[3]` do not affect the loop's execution and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 9**
