According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 5, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`n` is greater than 5, `i` is 5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 9, `dp[4]` is 41**
