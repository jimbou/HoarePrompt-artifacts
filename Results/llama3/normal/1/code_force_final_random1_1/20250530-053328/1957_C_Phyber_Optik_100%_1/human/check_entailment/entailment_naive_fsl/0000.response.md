Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. It uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of configurations for each possible number of remaining valid moves.

The program first initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size 300007, where `dp[i]` represents the number of configurations possible with `i` remaining valid moves. The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, which are correctly calculated.

The program then uses a recursive function `func_1` to fill up the `dp` array. The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`, which is correct.

In the main part of the program, it reads the input, calculates the number of invalid moves, and prints the maximum of 1 and `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which is the correct answer.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where there are no valid moves remaining, in which case it prints 1. It also correctly handles the case where there are multiple valid moves remaining, in which case it prints the correct number of configurations.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
