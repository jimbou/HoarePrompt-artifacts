According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable num. If num is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 - 1. num being between 0 and 2 * 10^4 - 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to num is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a is an integer between 0 and 19, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 - 1 and num is not equal to 0**
