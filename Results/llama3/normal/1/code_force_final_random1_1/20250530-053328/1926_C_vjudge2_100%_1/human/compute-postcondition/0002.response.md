The code snippet modifies the values of `a` and `num`. The first line adds the remainder of `num` divided by 10 to `a`. Since `num` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, the remainder of `num` divided by 10 can be any integer from 0 to 9. Therefore, `a` becomes an integer between 0 and 9. The second line assigns the integer part of `num` divided by 10 to `num`. This effectively removes the last digit of `num`. Since `num` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, the integer part of `num` divided by 10 can be any integer from 0 to 2 * 10^4.

Output State: **a is an integer between 0 and 9, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4**
