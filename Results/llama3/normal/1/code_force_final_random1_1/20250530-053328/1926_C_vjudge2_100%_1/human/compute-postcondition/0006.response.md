Output State: **a is an integer between 0 and 29, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 - 10**

The first line of the code increments the value of `a` by the remainder of `num` divided by 10. Since `num` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 - 1, the remainder of `num` divided by 10 can be any integer between 0 and 9. Therefore, the value of `a` can increase by any amount between 0 and 9. As a result, the range of `a` becomes 0 to 29.

The second line of the code updates the value of `num` by performing integer division of `num` by 10. This effectively removes the last digit of `num`. Since `num` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 - 1, the range of `num` after the division becomes 0 to 2 * 10^4 - 10.
