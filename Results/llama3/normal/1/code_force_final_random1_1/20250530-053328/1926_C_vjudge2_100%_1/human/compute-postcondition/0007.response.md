Output State: **a is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^5 - 1 + 9, num is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `a` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^5 - 1 + 9, and `num` is 0. This means that `a` will have accumulated the sum of all the digits of the original number, and `num` will have been reduced to 0 after all the iterations.
