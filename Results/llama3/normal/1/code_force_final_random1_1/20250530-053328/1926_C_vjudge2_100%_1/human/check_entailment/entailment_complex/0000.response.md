Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a precomputation approach to store the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 in an array A. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the precomputed sum for the given number n.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of digits for a given number by iteratively adding the last digit (`num % 10`) to the sum `a` and removing the last digit from `num` by performing integer division by 10 (`num = int(num / 10)`).

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. The time complexity is O(1) for each test case, which is well within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Correctness: **True**
