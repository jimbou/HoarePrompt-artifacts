Output State: **a is an integer between 0 and 19, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 - 1**

The code first increments the value of `a` by the last digit of `num`, which is obtained by taking the modulus of `num` with 10. Since `a` is initially an integer between 0 and 9, and the last digit of `num` is also between 0 and 9, the new value of `a` will be an integer between 0 and 19.

The second line then updates the value of `num` by performing integer division by 10. This effectively removes the last digit of `num`, leaving the remaining digits. Since `num` is initially an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, the new value of `num` will be an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 - 1.

Note that the range of `num` is updated to include 0, as the integer division by 10 can result in a quotient of 0 if the original value of `num` is a single digit.
