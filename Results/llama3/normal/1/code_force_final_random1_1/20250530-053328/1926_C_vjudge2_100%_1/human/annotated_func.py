#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5.
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        
        num = int(num / 10)
        
    #State: a is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^5 - 1 + 9, num is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns an integer 'a' that is between 0 and 2 * 10^5 - 1 + 9.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes an integer 'num' between 1 and 2 * 10^5 as input, calculates the sum of its digits, and returns the result as an integer 'a' between 0 and 2 * 10^5 - 1 + 9.
