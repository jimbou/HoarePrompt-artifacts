The only variable in the loop head is variable num, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable num.  If num is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, num is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4, So for the loop to be executed one more time num must not be equal to 0.
State: **a is an integer between 0 and 9, num is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4**
