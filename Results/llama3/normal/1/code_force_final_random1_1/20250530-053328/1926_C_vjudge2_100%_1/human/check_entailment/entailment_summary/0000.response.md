Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a precomputation approach to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 in an array A. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the precomputed value from the array.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. The use of precomputation helps to reduce the time complexity of the program, making it efficient enough to handle the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

The function func_1 is correctly implemented to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number. The main loop correctly populates the array A with the cumulative sum of the digit sums, and the test case loop correctly prints the precomputed values.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
