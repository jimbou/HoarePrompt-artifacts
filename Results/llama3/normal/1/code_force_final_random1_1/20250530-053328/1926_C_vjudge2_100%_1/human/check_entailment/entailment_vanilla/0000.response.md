Reasoning:

1. The problem asks us to find the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits.

2. The given program first calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200,000 and stores the cumulative sum in the list A.

3. Then, for each test case, it reads the input number n and prints the nth element of the list A (index n-1), which is the sum of the numbers on the board after the replacement.

4. The function func_1 calculates the sum of the digits of a given number by repeatedly taking the last digit (num % 10) and adding it to the sum, then removing the last digit (num = int(num / 10)).

5. The time complexity of the program is O(200,000) for the precalculation and O(1) for each test case, which is well within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

6. The space complexity is O(200,000) for storing the list A, which is also reasonable.

7. The program correctly handles the given input range (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and produces the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
