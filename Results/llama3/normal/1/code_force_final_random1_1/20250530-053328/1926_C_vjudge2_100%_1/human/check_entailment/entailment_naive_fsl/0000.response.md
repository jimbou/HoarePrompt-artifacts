Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a precomputation approach to calculate the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200000 and stores them in the list A. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the sum of the digits for the given number n, which is stored in A[n-1].

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where n is 1 or 200000. The time complexity of the program is O(1) for each test case, which is within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

The function func_1 correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number by using a while loop to extract each digit and add it to the sum. The main program correctly uses this function to precompute the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200000 and stores them in the list A.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it handles all potential cases correctly.
