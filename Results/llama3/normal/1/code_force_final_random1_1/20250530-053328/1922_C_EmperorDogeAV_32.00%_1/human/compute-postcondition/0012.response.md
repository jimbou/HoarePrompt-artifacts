Output State: **`cities` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `prog_cities` is a list of at least 1 integer, `prog_cities[i]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`, if the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1`, then `back` is the value of the city at index `i-1` and `forward` is the value of the city at index `i+1` if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise the values of `back` and `forward` remain unchanged, if the current value of `i` is not less than `n - 1`, then the values of `back` and `forward` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of cities remains unchanged, the number of cities remains the same, and the list of progressive cities is updated with the absolute difference between the forward city and the current city at index i. The values of back and forward are updated according to the current index i, and the absolute difference between forward and the city at index i is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the city at index i and back.
