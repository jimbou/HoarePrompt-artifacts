Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another. The function `func_1` calculates the absolute difference between consecutive cities in a list, or sets the difference to 1 if the current city is closer to the previous city. This is used to calculate the prefix sums of the forward and backward cities, which are then used to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another.

The program also correctly handles the case where the closest city to a given city is the previous city, by setting the difference to 1. This ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another, even in cases where the closest city is the previous city.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
