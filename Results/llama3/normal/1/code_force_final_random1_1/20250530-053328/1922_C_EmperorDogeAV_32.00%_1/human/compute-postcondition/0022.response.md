Postcondition: **`cities` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `prog_cities` is a list of at least 1 integer. If `i` > 0, `back` is the second smallest city in the list of cities, otherwise, `back` is -99999999. If `i` < `n` - 1, `forward` is the (i+2)th smallest city in the list of cities. Otherwise, `forward` is 99999999. `i` is increased by 1. If the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, the ith element of `prog_cities` is 1. Otherwise, the ith element of `prog_cities` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.**
