Postcondition: **`cities` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `prog_cities` is a list of at least 2 integers. If `i` < `n` - 1, then if `i` > 0, `back` is a non-negative integer and `forward` is the (i+2)th element of `cities`. If `i` is 0, `back` is -99999999 and `forward` is the second element of `cities`. If `i` >= `n` - 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. `i` is increased by 1. If the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, then the ith element of `prog_cities` is 1. Otherwise, the ith element of `prog_cities` is the absolute difference between the (i+2)th element of `cities` and the ith element of `cities`.**
