Output State: **cities is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of at least 2 integers, back is -99999999, forward is 99999999, i is increased by 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value -99999999 to `back` and 99999999 to `forward`, regardless of the initial values of `i`, `cities`, `n`, and `prog_cities`. The values of `cities`, `n`, and `prog_cities` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is increased by 1.
