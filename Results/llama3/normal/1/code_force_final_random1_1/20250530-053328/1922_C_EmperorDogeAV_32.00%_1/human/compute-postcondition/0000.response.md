Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer, prog_cities is a list of (n - 1) zeros**

In this output state, the code has created a new list called `prog_cities` with a length of `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of elements in the `cities` list. The `prog_cities` list is initialized with all zeros. The `cities` list and the value of `n` remain unchanged.
