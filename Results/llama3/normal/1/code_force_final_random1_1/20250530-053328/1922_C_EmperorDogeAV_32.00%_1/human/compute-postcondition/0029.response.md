Output State: **`cities` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `prog_cities` is a list of at least 2 integers where the ith element is 1, `i` is increased by 1. If `i` < `n` - 1, then if `i` > 0, `back` is a non-negative integer and `forward` is the (i+2)th element of `cities`. If `i` is 0, `back` is -99999999 and `forward` is the second element of `cities`. If `i` >= `n` - 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `prog_cities` has its ith element set to 1. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `cities` still being a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` being at least 2, and the values of `back` and `forward` depending on the value of `i`.
