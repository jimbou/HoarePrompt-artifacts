Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of cities and their coordinates. It then calculates the closest city for each city and stores the distances in the `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` lists. The program then calculates the prefix sums of these distances and stores them in the `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` lists.

For each query, the program reads the source and destination cities and calculates the minimum distance by subtracting the prefix sum of the source city from the prefix sum of the destination city. If the source city is less than the destination city, it uses the `pref_sum_f` list; otherwise, it uses the `pref_sum_b` list.

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the closest city for each city and returns a list of distances. The program correctly handles the edge cases where the source or destination city is the first or last city.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
