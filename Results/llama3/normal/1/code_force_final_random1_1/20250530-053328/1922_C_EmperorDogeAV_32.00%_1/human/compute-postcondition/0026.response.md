Postcondition: ***cities is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of at least 2 integers, i is increased by 1. If i > 0, then back is a non-negative integer and forward is 99999999. Otherwise, back is -99999999 and forward is 99999999.***
