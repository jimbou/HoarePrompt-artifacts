Output State: **cities is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of at least 1 zero, i is 0, back is -99999999, forward is 99999999**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to the variables `back` and `forward`. The first line assigns the value `-99999999` to `back`, and the second line assigns the value `99999999` to `forward`. These assignments do not affect the values of the other variables in the initial state.

The initial state variables `cities`, `n`, `prog_cities`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet. The values of `back` and `forward` are updated to the assigned values.

In summary, the code snippet only modifies the values of `back` and `forward`, leaving the other variables in their initial state.
