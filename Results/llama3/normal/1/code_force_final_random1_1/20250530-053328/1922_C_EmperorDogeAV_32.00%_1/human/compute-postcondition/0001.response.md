To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n - 1` is at least 1, which means `n` must be at least 2. Before the loop starts, `cities` is a list of `n` non-negative integers in ascending order, and `prog_cities` is a list of `(n - 1)` zeros.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2, and the state of `i` to be 0 (since the loop starts from 0).

State: **`cities` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `prog_cities` is a list of at least 1 zero, `i` is 0**
