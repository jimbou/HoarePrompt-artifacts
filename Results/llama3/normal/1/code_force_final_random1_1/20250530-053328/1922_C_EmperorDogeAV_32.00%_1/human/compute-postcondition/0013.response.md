Postcondition: ***cities is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of at least 1 integer. If the absolute difference between the current value of forward and the value of the city at index i is less than the absolute difference between the value of the city at index i and the current value of back, then prog_cities is a list of at least 1 zero except at index i where it is 1. Otherwise, prog_cities[i] is the absolute difference between forward and cities[i]. If the current value of i is less than n - 1, then back is the value of the city at index i-1 and forward is the value of the city at index i+1 if i is greater than 0, otherwise the values of back and forward remain unchanged. If the current value of i is not less than n - 1, then the values of back and forward remain unchanged.***
