Output State: **cities is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of at least 2 integers, i is increased by 1. If i > 0, then back is a non-negative integer and forward is the (i+2)th element of cities. Otherwise, back is -99999999 and forward is the second element of cities.**

In this output state, the value of forward has been updated to be the (i+2)th element of cities if i is greater than 0, or the second element of cities if i is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
