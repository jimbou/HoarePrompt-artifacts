Output State: **cities is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of at least 1 zero, if the current value of i is greater than 0, back is the value of the city at index i-1 and forward is the value of the city at index i+1. Otherwise, the values of back and forward remain unchanged. The current value of i is less than n - 1**

In this output state, the value of forward has been updated to be the value of the city at index i+1 in the list cities. The other variables remain unchanged. The list cities is still in ascending order, and n is still at least 2. The list prog_cities still contains at least one zero. The value of back is still the value of the city at index i-1 if i is greater than 0, and remains unchanged otherwise. The current value of i is still less than n - 1.
