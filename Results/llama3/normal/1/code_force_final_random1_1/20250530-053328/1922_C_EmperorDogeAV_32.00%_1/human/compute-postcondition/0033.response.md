Output State: **The program returns a list of (n - 1) integers, where each integer represents the absolute difference between the current city and the next city, or 1 if the current city is closer to the previous city.**

In this output state, the list `prog_cities` contains (n - 1) integers, where each integer represents the absolute difference between the current city and the next city, or 1 if the current city is closer to the previous city. The list is calculated based on the initial state of the cities list, which is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order. The program iterates through the cities list, comparing the absolute difference between the current city and the next city, and the absolute difference between the current city and the previous city. If the current city is closer to the previous city, the program sets the corresponding value in `prog_cities` to 1. Otherwise, it sets the value to the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.
