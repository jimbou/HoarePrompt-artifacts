Output State: **`cities` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `prog_cities` is a list of at least 2 integers where the ith element is the absolute difference between the (i+2)th element of `cities` and the ith element of `cities`, `i` is increased by 1. If `i` < `n` - 1, then if `i` > 0, `back` is a non-negative integer and `forward` is the (i+2)th element of `cities`. If `i` is 0, `back` is -99999999 and `forward` is the second element of `cities`. If `i` >= `n` - 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `prog_cities[i]` has been updated to be the absolute difference between the `(i+2)`th element of `cities` and the `i`th element of `cities`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still constrained by the initial conditions.
