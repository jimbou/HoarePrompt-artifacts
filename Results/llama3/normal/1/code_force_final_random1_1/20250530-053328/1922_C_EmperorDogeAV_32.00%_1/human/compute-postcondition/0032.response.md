Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer, prog_cities is a list of (n - 1) integers. If the absolute difference between the current value of forward and the value of the city at index i is less than the absolute difference between the value of the city at index i and the current value of back, then prog_cities is a list of (n - 1) ones. Otherwise, prog_cities[i] is the absolute difference between forward and cities[i]. If the current value of i is less than n - 1, then back is the value of the city at index i-1 and forward is the value of the city at index i+1 if i is greater than 0, otherwise the values of back and forward remain unchanged. If the current value of i is not less than n - 1, then the values of back and forward remain unchanged.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of cities in ascending order, a non-negative integer n, and a list of (n - 1) integers representing the progress of cities. The progress of each city is determined by comparing the absolute difference between the current city and its neighboring cities. If the absolute difference between the current city and the next city is less than the absolute difference between the current city and the previous city, the progress of the current city is 1. Otherwise, the progress of the current city is the absolute difference between the current city and the next city. The values of back and forward are updated accordingly based on the current value of i.
