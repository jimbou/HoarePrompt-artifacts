Postcondition: ***cities is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of at least 2 integers, i is increased by 1. If i < n - 1, then if i > 0, back is a non-negative integer and forward is the (i+2)th element of cities. If i is 0, back is -99999999 and forward is the second element of cities. If i >= n - 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
