Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer, prog_cities is a list of (n - 1) zeros
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    back = -99999999
    forward = 99999999
    if i > 0:
        back = cities[i - 1]
    if i < n - 1:
        forward = cities[i + 1]
    if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
        prog_cities[i] = 1
    else:
        prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cities is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of at least 1 integer. If the absolute difference between the current value of forward and the value of the city at index i is less than the absolute difference between the value of the city at index i and the current value of back, then prog_cities is a list of at least 1 zero except at index i where it is 1. Otherwise, prog_cities[i] is the absolute difference between forward and cities[i]. If the current value of i is less than n - 1, then back is the value of the city at index i-1 and forward is the value of the city at index i+1 if i is greater than 0, otherwise the values of back and forward remain unchanged. If the current value of i is not less than n - 1, then the values of back and forward remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cities` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `prog_cities` is a list of at least 1 integer. If `i` > 0, `back` is the second smallest city in the list of cities, otherwise, `back` is -99999999. If `i` < `n` - 1, `forward` is the (i+2)th smallest city in the list of cities. Otherwise, `forward` is 99999999. `i` is increased by 1. If the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, the ith element of `prog_cities` is 1. Otherwise, the ith element of `prog_cities` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cities` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `prog_cities` is a list of at least 2 integers. If `i` < `n` - 1, then if `i` > 0, `back` is a non-negative integer and `forward` is the (i+2)th element of `cities`. If `i` is 0, `back` is -99999999 and `forward` is the second element of `cities`. If `i` >= `n` - 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. `i` is increased by 1. If the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, then the ith element of `prog_cities` is 1. Otherwise, the ith element of `prog_cities` is the absolute difference between the (i+2)th element of `cities` and the ith element of `cities`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
