The code assigns the value of `cities[i - 1]` to `back`. Since `i` is increased by 1, the value of `i` is at least 2. The list `cities` has at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order. Therefore, the value of `cities[i - 1]` is a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `prog_cities` is a list of at least 2 integers, `back` is a non-negative integer, `forward` is 99999999, `i` is increased by 1**
