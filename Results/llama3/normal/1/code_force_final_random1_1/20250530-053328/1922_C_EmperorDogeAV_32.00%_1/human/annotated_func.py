#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer.

        back = -99999999

    #State: cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer, prog_cities is a list of (n - 1) integers. If the absolute difference between the current value of forward and the value of the city at index i is less than the absolute difference between the value of the city at index i and the current value of back, then prog_cities is a list of (n - 1) ones. Otherwise, prog_cities[i] is the absolute difference between forward and cities[i]. If the current value of i is less than n - 1, then back is the value of the city at index i-1 and forward is the value of the city at index i+1 if i is greater than 0, otherwise the values of back and forward remain unchanged. If the current value of i is not less than n - 1, then the values of back and forward remain unchanged.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list of (n - 1) integers, where each integer represents the absolute difference between the current city and the next city, or 1 if the current city is closer to the previous city.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the absolute difference between consecutive cities in a list, or sets the difference to 1 if the current city is closer to the previous city. It takes a list of non-negative integers representing cities and returns a list of (n-1) integers, where each integer represents the calculated difference.
