Output State: **cities is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of at least 1 integer, i is increased by 1. If i > 0, back is the second smallest city in the list of cities, otherwise, back is -99999999. forward is the (i+2)th smallest city in the list of cities.**

In this output state, the value of forward has been updated to be the (i+2)th smallest city in the list of cities, which is the city at index i+1 in the list. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
