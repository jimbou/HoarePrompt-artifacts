Output State: **cities is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of at least 1 zero, the current value of i is greater than 0, back is the value of the city at index i-1, and forward is 99999999.**

In this output state, the value of `back` has been updated to be the value of the city at index `i-1` in the `cities` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The `cities` list is still a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is still at least 2, `prog_cities` is still a list of at least 1 zero, `i` is still greater than 0, and `forward` is still 99999999.
