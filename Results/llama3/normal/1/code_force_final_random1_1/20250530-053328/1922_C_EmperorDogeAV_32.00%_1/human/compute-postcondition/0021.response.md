Output State: **`cities` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `prog_cities` is a list of at least 1 integer where the ith element is the absolute difference between the (i+2)th smallest city in the list of cities and the ith smallest city in the list of cities, `i` is increased by 1. If `i` > 0, `back` is the second smallest city in the list of cities, otherwise, `back` is -99999999. If `i` < `n` - 1, `forward` is the (i+2)th smallest city in the list of cities. Otherwise, `forward` is 99999999.**

In this output state, the value of `prog_cities[i]` has been updated to be the absolute difference between the (i+2)th smallest city in the list of cities and the ith smallest city in the list of cities. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` has been increased by 1, but its new value is not specified. The conditions for `back` and `forward` are still valid, but their values may have changed due to the increase in `i`.
