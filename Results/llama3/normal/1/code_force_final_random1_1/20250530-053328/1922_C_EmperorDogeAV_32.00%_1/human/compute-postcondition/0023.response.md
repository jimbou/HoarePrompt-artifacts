The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n - 1`. 
State: **`cities` is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `prog_cities` is a list of at least 2 integers. If `i` > 0, `back` is the second smallest city in the list of cities, otherwise, `back` is -99999999. If `i` < `n` - 1, `forward` is the (i+2)th smallest city in the list of cities. Otherwise, `forward` is 99999999. `i` is increased by 1.**
