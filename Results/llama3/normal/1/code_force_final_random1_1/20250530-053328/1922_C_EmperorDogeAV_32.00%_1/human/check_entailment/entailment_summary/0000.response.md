Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities. The program first calculates the closest city for each city and then calculates the prefix sum of the distances to the closest cities in both forward and backward directions. This allows it to efficiently calculate the minimum number of coins needed for each query.

The program handles the cases where the query is in the forward direction (a < b) and the backward direction (a > b) correctly by using the corresponding prefix sum arrays.

The function func_1 is also correct. It calculates the distance to the closest city for each city by comparing the distances to the previous and next cities. If the current city is closer to the previous city, it sets the distance to 1; otherwise, it sets the distance to the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.

Correctness: **True**
