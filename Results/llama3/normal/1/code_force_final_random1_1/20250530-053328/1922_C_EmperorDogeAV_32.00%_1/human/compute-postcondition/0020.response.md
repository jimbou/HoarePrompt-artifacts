Output State: **cities is a list of at least 2 non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of at least 1 integer where the ith element is 1, i is increased by 1. If i > 0, back is the second smallest city in the list of cities, otherwise, back is -99999999. If i < n - 1, forward is the (i+2)th smallest city in the list of cities. Otherwise, forward is 99999999.**

In this output state, the value of prog_cities[i] has been updated to 1, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list prog_cities now has its ith element set to 1, and the other variables retain their original values and conditions.
