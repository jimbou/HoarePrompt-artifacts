The variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is not zero, So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, n is greater than 0, k is an integer, L is [m], tot is n * (n+1)//2, pow is 2^n, stdin is empty, a is undefined, m is (n+1)//2**
