Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
        L.append(m)
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
        tot += a
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is 1, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is an empty list, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in the list, pow is 2 to the power of the number of elements in the list, stdin is empty, a is the last element in the list. If the current value of tot is less than k and the current value of k is less than or equal to tot plus a, the result of the expression 2 to the power of the number of elements in the list minus 1, times 2 times k minus tot minus 1 is printed, where k is either 1 or 0, and tot is the sum of all elements in the list L.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 1, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is an empty list, tot is n * (n+1)//2, pow is 2^n, stdin is empty, a is undefined, m is (n+1)//2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0, n is 0, k is an integer, L is a list of 0 repeated 0 times, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in L, pow is 2 to the power of the length of L times the original value of pow, a is the last element in L, m is 0, stdin is empty. If the sum of all elements in L except the last one is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of all elements in L, then the result of the expression pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed, where pow is 2 to the power of the length of L times the original value of pow, k is an integer, and tot is the sum of all elements in L.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
