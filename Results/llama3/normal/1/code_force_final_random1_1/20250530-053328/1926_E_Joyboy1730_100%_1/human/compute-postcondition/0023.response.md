The only object in the loop head is variable  a and list L, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list L.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, L has at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the a is the third element in the list.
State: **t is 1, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing a sequence of integers that must have at least 3 elements, tot is equal to the sum of the second and third elements in the list, pow is 4, stdin is empty, a is the third element in the list.**
