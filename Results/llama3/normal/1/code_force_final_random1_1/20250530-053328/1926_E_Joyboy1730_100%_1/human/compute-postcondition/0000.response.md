The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). After the code is executed, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, and the stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). The values of the other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
