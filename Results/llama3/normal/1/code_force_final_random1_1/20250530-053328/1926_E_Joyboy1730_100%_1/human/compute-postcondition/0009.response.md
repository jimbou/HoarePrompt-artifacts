Output State: t is 1, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and the original value of n inclusive, L is a list containing a sequence of integers where each integer is half of the previous integer rounded down, stdin is empty.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable t remains unchanged at 1, the variable n becomes 0, the variable k remains an integer between 1 and the original value of n inclusive, and the list L contains a sequence of integers where each integer is half of the previous integer rounded down. The stdin remains empty.
