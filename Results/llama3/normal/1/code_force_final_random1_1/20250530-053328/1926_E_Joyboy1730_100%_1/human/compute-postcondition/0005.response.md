According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer between 0 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive. n being between 0 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to n is greater than 0.
State: **t is 1, n is greater than 0, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, L is a list containing a single integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive, stdin is empty**
