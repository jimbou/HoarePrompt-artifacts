Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 1, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing n elements which are (n+1)//2, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin is empty, a is the last element in the list which is (n+1)//2, m is (n+1)//2
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 1, n is greater than 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing n elements which are (n+1)//2, tot is (n+1)//2, pow is 2, stdin is empty, a is the first element in the list which is (n+1)//2, m is (n+1)//2. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of tot and a, then pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed, where pow is 2, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, and tot is (n+1)//2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 1, n is greater than 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing n-1 elements which are (n+1)//2, tot is 2 * (n+1)//2, pow is 4, stdin is empty, a is (n+1)//2, m is (n+1)//2. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot + a, then the program prints 2 * (k - (n+1)//2) - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 1, n is greater than 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing n-2 elements which are (n+1)//2, pow is 8, tot is (n+1)//2 + (n+1)//2, a is (n+1)//2, m is (n+1)//2, stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
