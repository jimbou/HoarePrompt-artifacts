The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`. 

`pow` is 2, `k` is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, and `tot` is equal to the second element in the list `L`. Since `k` is between 1 and 0 inclusive, `k` must be 0 (because there are no integers between 1 and 0). 

So, `k - tot` is `-tot` (because `k` is 0). 

`2 * (k - tot)` is `-2 * tot` (because `k - tot` is `-tot`). 

`2 * (k - tot) - 1` is `-2 * tot - 1` (because `2 * (k - tot)` is `-2 * tot`). 

`pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` is `2 * (-2 * tot - 1)` (because `pow` is 2). 

`2 * (-2 * tot - 1)` is `-4 * tot - 2` (because `2 * (-2 * tot - 1)` is `-4 * tot - 2`). 

Since `tot` is equal to the second element in the list `L`, `-4 * tot - 2` is `-4 * (the second element in the list L) - 2`.

Output: **-4 * (the second element in the list L) - 2**
