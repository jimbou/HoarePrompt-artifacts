The variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value, So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0.
State: **t is 1, n is greater than 0 and less than its original value, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, L is a list containing two integers: the original integer between 1 and 5 * 10^8 inclusive and the new integer m which is half of the original value of n rounded down, stdin is empty**
