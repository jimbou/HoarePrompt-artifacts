Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, n is 0, k is an integer, L is a list of 0 repeated 0 times, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin is empty, a is undefined, m is 0
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, n is 0, k is an integer, L is a list with at least 1 element, tot is equal to the first element in L, pow is 2 times the original value of pow, a is the first element in L, m is 0, stdin is empty. If the current value of tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of tot and a, then the value of pow multiplied by (2 times the difference between k and tot minus 1) is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0, n is 0, k is an integer, L is a list with at least 2 elements, tot is equal to the sum of the first two elements in L, pow is 4 times the original value of pow, a is the second element in L, m is 0, stdin is empty. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then the expression pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed, where pow is 4 times the original value of pow, k is an integer, and tot is equal to the sum of the first two elements in L.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0, n is 0, k is an integer, L is a list with at least 3 elements, tot is equal to the sum of the first three elements in L, pow is 8 times the original value of pow, a is the third element in L, m is 0, stdin is empty. If the sum of the first two elements in L is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of the first two elements in L plus the third element in L, then the result of the expression pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed, where pow is 8 times the original value of pow, k is an integer, and tot is the sum of the first three elements in L.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
