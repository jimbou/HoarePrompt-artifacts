Output State: **t is 1, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing a sequence of integers that must have at least 1 element, tot is equal to the first element in the list, pow is 2, stdin is empty, a is the first element in the list. If the current value of tot is less than k and the current value of k is less than or equal to tot plus a, either 1 or -1 is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.**
