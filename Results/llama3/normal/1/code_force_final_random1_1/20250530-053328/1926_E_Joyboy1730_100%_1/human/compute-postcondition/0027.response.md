Output State: **t is 1, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing a sequence of integers that must have at least 3 elements, tot is equal to the sum of the second, third and fourth elements in the list, pow is 8, stdin is empty, a is the third element in the list. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, the result of the expression 4 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is being printed, where k is either 1 or 0, and tot is the sum of the second, third and fourth elements in the list L.**
