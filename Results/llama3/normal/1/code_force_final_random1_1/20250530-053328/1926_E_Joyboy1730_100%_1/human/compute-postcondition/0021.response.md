Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, `L` is a list containing a sequence of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `tot` is equal to the second element in the list, `pow` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `a` is the second element in the list. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the result of the expression `2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` is printed, which is between `-2*tot + 1` and `-2*tot - 1`.***
