To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the variables and their values based on the initial state:

1. **pow**: This is explicitly stated to be 2.
2. **k**: This is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive. However, since k cannot be less than 0 (as it's between 1 and 0 inclusive), we can infer k is actually 1.
3. **tot**: This is calculated as (n+1)//2. The value of n is not explicitly given, but we know it's greater than 0. However, since we're looking for a precise description, we'll keep it in terms of n.

Given these values, let's calculate the expression inside the print statement:

pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)

Substituting the known values:

2 * (1 - (n+1)//2) - 1

This simplifies to:

2 * (1 - (n+1)//2) - 1

Since we cannot simplify this expression further without knowing the value of n, we'll leave it in this form.

Output: **2 * (1 - (n+1)//2) - 1 (where n is a value greater than 0)**
