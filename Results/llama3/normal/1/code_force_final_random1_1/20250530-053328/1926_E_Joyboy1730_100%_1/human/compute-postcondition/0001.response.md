According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the variable `t` is 1 and the stdin contains 1 line, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).
State: **`t` is 1, stdin contains 1 line, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
