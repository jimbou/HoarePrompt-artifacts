Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is 0, k is an integer, L is a list with at least 1 element, tot is equal to the first element in L, pow is 2 times the original value of pow, a is the first element in L, m is 0, stdin is empty. If the current value of tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of tot and a, then the value of pow multiplied by (2 times the difference between k and tot minus 1) is printed.**
