Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 1, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing a sequence of integers, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is 1, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing a sequence of integers that must have at least 1 element, tot is equal to the first element in the list, pow is 2, stdin is empty, a is the first element in the list. If the current value of tot is less than k and the current value of k is less than or equal to tot plus a, either 1 or -1 is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is 1, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing a sequence of integers that must have at least 2 elements, tot is equal to the sum of the second and third elements in the list, pow is 4, stdin is empty, a is the second element in the list. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot + a, the result of the expression 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed, which is between -2*tot + 1 and -2*tot - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is 1, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing a sequence of integers that must have at least 3 elements, tot is equal to the sum of the second, third and fourth elements in the list, pow is 8, stdin is empty, a is the third element in the list. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, the result of the expression 4 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is being printed, where k is either 1 or 0, and tot is the sum of the second, third and fourth elements in the list L.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
