Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then generates a sequence of integers by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible integer from n until n becomes 0. For each test case, it iterates through the generated sequence and checks if the cumulative sum of the sequence elements is within the range [k, k + a], where a is the current sequence element. If it is, the function prints the result of the expression 2 * (k - tot) - 1 multiplied by 2 to the power of the number of elements in the sequence. The function repeats this process for all test cases and leaves the input stream empty.**
