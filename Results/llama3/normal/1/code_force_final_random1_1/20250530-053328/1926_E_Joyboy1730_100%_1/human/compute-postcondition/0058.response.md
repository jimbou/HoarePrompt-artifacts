The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, n is an integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to n is not zero.

State: **t is greater than 0, n is not zero, k is an integer, L is an empty list, tot is n * (n+1)//2, pow is 2^n, stdin is empty, a is undefined, m is (n+1)//2**
