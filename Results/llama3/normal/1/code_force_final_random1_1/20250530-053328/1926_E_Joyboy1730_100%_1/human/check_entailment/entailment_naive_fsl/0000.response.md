Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the process described in the problem statement. It first calculates the number of cards in each category (odd, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, etc.) and stores them in the list L. Then, it iterates over the list L and checks if the k-th card falls within the current category. If it does, it calculates the value of the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where k is 1 or n. The use of the `tot` variable to keep track of the total number of cards processed so far ensures that the program correctly identifies the category of the k-th card.

The program also correctly handles the case where n is a power of 2, in which case the last category will have only one card. The use of the `pow` variable to keep track of the current power of 2 ensures that the program correctly calculates the value of the k-th card in this case.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
