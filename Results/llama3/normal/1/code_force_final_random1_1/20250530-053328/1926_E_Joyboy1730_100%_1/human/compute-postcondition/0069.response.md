The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`. 

Here, `pow` is 1, `k` is an integer, and `tot` is 0. Since `tot` is 0, the expression `2 * (k - tot)` simplifies to `2 * k`. 

The expression `2 * k - 1` is then multiplied by `pow`, which is 1. Therefore, the final result is simply `2 * k - 1`.

Since `k` is an integer, the result `2 * k - 1` will also be an integer.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is an integer)**
