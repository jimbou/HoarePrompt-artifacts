Output: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, `L` is a list containing `n` elements which are `(n+1)//2`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is the first element in the list which is `(n+1)//2`, `m` is `(n+1)//2. The current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`, and this is printed: `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` where `pow` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, and `tot` is 0**
