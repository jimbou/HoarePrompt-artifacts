Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 1, n is an integer, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is an empty list, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in the list, pow is 2 to the power of the number of elements in the list, stdin is empty, a is the last element in the list
Code of the loop:
while n:
    m = (n + 1) // 2
    n -= m
    L.append(m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 1, n is not equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing one element which is (n+1)//2, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in the list which is (n+1)//2, pow is 2 to the power of the number of elements in the list which is 2, stdin is empty, a is the last element in the list which is (n+1)//2, m is (n+1)//2
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is greater than 1, n is not equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing two elements which are (n+1)//2 and (n+1)//2, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in the list which is (n+1)//2 + (n+1)//2, pow is 2 to the power of the number of elements in the list which is 4, stdin is empty, a is the last element in the list which is (n+1)//2, m is (n+1)//2, n is 0
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than 1, n is not equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing three elements which are (n+1)//2, (n+1)//2 and (n+1)//2, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in the list which is (n+1)//2 + (n+1)//2 + (n+1)//2, pow is 2 to the power of the number of elements in the list which is 8, stdin is empty, a is the last element in the list which is (n+1)//2, m is (n+1)//2, n is 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
