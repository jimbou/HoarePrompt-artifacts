Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer, `L` is a list with at least 1 element, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `a` is the first element in `L`, `m` is 0. If the current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`, then the value of `pow` multiplied by (2 times the difference between `k` and `tot` minus 1) is printed.***
