Output State: **t is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, L is an empty list, stdin is empty**

The first line assigns the two integers from the input to `n` and `k`. Since the input contains two integers, `n` and `k` are now integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, with `k` being less than or equal to `n`. The second line creates an empty list and assigns it to `L`. The third line does not affect any variables. 

The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Stdin is now empty as the input has been consumed.
