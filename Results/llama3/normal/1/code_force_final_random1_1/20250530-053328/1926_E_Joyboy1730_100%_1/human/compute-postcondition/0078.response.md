The only variable in the loop head is variable  a, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list L. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, L has at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the a is the third element in the list.
State: **t is greater than 0, n is 0, k is an integer, L is a list with at least 3 elements, tot is equal to the sum of the first two elements in L, pow is 4 times the original value of pow, a is the third element in L, m is 0, stdin is empty**
