Output State: t is 1, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, L is a list containing a sequence of integers, stdin is empty

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable t remains unchanged at 1, the variable n becomes 0, the variable k remains an integer between 1 and n inclusive, and the list L contains a sequence of integers that are the values of m calculated in each iteration of the loop. The stdin remains empty.
