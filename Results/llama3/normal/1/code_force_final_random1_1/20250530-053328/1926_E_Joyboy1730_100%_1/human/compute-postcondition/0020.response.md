Output: **`t` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, `L` is a list containing a sequence of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `tot` is equal to the second element in the list, `pow` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `a` is the second element in the list, and this is printed: the result of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` which is equal to `2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` since `pow` is 2, and since `k` is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive and `tot` is equal to the second element in the list, the value of `2 * (k - tot) - 1` is between `2 * (1 - tot) - 1` and `2 * (0 - tot) - 1` which is between `-2*tot + 1` and `-2*tot - 1`**
