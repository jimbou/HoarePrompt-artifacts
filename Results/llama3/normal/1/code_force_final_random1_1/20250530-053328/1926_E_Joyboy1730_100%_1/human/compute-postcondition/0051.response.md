The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`. 

Here, `pow` is 4, `k` is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, and `tot` is 2 * (n+1)//2.

Since `k` is between 1 and 0 inclusive, it can only be 0 or 1. However, since `k` is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, `k` is 0.

`tot` is 2 * (n+1)//2. Since `n` is greater than 0, `n+1` is greater than 1, and `(n+1)//2` is the integer part of the division of `n+1` by 2. Therefore, `(n+1)//2` is at least 1.

Since `tot` is 2 * (n+1)//2, `tot` is at least 2.

Since `k` is 0 and `tot` is at least 2, `k - tot` is at most -2.

`2 * (k - tot)` is at most -4.

`2 * (k - tot) - 1` is at most -5.

`pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` is at most -20.

Since `pow` is 4, `k` is 0, and `tot` is 2 * (n+1)//2, the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` is -20.

Output: **-20**
