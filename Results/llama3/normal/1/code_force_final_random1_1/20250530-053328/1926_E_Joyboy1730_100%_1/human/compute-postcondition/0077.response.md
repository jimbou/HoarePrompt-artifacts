Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is 0, k is an integer, L is a list with at least 2 elements, tot is equal to the sum of the first two elements in L, pow is 4 times the original value of pow, a is the second element in L, m is 0, stdin is empty. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then the expression pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed, where pow is 4 times the original value of pow, k is an integer, and tot is equal to the sum of the first two elements in L.**
