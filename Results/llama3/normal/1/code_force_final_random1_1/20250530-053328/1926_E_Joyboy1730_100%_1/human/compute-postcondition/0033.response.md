The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is not equal to 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be not equal to 0.
State: **t is greater than 1, n is not equal to 0, k is an integer between 1 and 0 inclusive, L is a list containing one element which is (n+1)//2, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in the list which is (n+1)//2, pow is 2 to the power of the number of elements in the list which is 2, stdin is empty, a is the last element in the list which is (n+1)//2, m is (n+1)//2**
