Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is at least 2, stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of lowercase English letters with length at most 10, s is a string of lowercase English letters with length at most 10, a is a set of lowercase English letters, b is a string of lowercase English letters sorted in ascending order and equal to s, c is a string of lowercase English letters sorted in descending order and equal to s, 'YES' is being printed**

The code snippet sorts the string `s` in ascending and descending order, assigning the results to `b` and `c`, respectively. Since `b` is now equal to `s`, `c` is being printed. The size of set `a` is not modified by the code, so if it was exactly 2, 'NO' would have been printed, but since 'YES' is being printed, the size of `a` must be other than 2. The values of `n`, `i`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
