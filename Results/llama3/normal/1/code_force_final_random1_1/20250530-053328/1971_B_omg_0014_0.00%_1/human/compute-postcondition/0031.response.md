The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, `n` is between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is at least 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is at least 2, stdin contains n-2 inputs: strings of lowercase English letters with length at most 10, s is a string of lowercase English letters with length at most 10, a is a set of lowercase English letters, b is a string of lowercase English letters sorted in ascending order, c is a string of lowercase English letters sorted in descending order. If the size of a is exactly 2, then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed. If b is equal to s, then c is being printed. Otherwise, b is being printed.**
