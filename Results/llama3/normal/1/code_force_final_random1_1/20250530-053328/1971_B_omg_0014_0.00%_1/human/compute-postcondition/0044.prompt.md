Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `n` inputs: strings s of lowercase English letters with length at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is at least 0, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings s of lowercase English letters with length at most 10, s is a string of lowercase English letters with length at most 10, a is a set of lowercase English letters. If the size of a is exactly 2, then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed, b is a string of lowercase English letters sorted in ascending order, c is a string of lowercase English letters sorted in descending order. If b is equal to s, then c is being printed. Otherwise, b is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is at least 1, stdin contains n-2 inputs: strings of lowercase English letters with length at most 10, s is a string of lowercase English letters with length at most 10, a is a set of lowercase English letters, b is a string of lowercase English letters sorted in ascending order, c is a string of lowercase English letters sorted in descending order. If the size of a is exactly 2, then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed. If b is equal to s, then c is being printed. Otherwise, b is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is at least 2, stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of lowercase English letters with length at most 10, s is a string of lowercase English letters with length at most 10, a is a set of lowercase English letters, b is a string of lowercase English letters sorted in ascending order, c is a string of lowercase English letters sorted in descending order. If the size of a is exactly 2, then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed. If b is equal to s, then c is being printed. Otherwise, b is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
