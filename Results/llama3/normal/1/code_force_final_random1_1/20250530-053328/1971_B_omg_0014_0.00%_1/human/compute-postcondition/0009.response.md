Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is at least 0, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings s of lowercase English letters with length at most 10, s is a string of lowercase English letters with length at most 10, a is a set of lowercase English letters, and the size of a is not equal to 2, b is a string of lowercase English letters sorted in ascending order, c is a string of lowercase English letters sorted in descending order, and 'YES' is being printed.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign sorted versions of the string `s` to the variables `b` and `c`. The first line sorts the characters in `s` in ascending order and assigns the result to `b`. The second line sorts the characters in `s` in descending order and assigns the result to `c`. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
