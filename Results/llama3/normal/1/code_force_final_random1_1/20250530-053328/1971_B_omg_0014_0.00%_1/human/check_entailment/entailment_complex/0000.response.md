Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of rearranging the characters of a string to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. The program works by first checking if the string contains exactly two unique characters. If it does, the program prints 'NO' because it is impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to the original string.

If the string contains more than two unique characters, the program prints 'YES' and then prints the string sorted in ascending order unless the original string is already sorted, in which case it prints the string sorted in descending order.

The program's logic is correct because if a string contains exactly two unique characters, it is indeed impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. On the other hand, if a string contains more than two unique characters, it is always possible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to the original string by sorting the characters in ascending or descending order.

However, the program's logic is not entirely correct. The condition `if len(a) == 2:` is not sufficient to determine if it's impossible to rearrange the characters. For example, the string "xxxxy" contains more than two unique characters, but it's still impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to the original string.

A correct condition would be to check if the string contains only one unique character or if it contains exactly two unique characters and one of them appears only once.

Correctness: **False**
