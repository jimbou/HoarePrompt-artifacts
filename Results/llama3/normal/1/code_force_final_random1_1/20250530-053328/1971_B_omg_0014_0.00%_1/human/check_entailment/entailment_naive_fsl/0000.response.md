Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string has more than two distinct characters and is already sorted in ascending or descending order. In such cases, the program will print the same string, which is not a rearrangement of the original string.

For example, if the input string is "abcde", the program will print "YES" and then print "abcde" again, which is not a rearrangement of the original string.
