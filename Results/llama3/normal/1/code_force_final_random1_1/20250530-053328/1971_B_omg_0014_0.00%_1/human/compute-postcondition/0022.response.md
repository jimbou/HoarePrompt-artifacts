Based on the precondition, the code will print 'YES' only if the size of set 'a' is not exactly 2. Since the size of 'a' is not explicitly given, we can't determine the exact output. However, we can describe the output based on the condition.

Output: **YES (if the size of set 'a' is not exactly 2)**
