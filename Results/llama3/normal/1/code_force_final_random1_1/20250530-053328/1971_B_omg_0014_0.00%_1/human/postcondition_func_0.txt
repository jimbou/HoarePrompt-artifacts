This function reads a series of strings from standard input, checks if each string contains exactly two unique characters, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. If a string contains more than two unique characters, it prints the string sorted in ascending order unless the original string is already sorted, in which case it prints the string sorted in descending order. The function processes a number of strings specified by the first input, which is an integer between 1 and 1000.
