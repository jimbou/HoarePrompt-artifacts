To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already given as an integer between 1 and 1000, we can focus on adjusting `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already between 1 and 1000, we can conclude that `n` is at least 1.

Now, let's consider `i`. Since the loop uses `range(n)`, `i` will take on values from 0 to `n-1`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust `i` to be at least 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is at least 0, stdin contains `n` inputs: strings s of lowercase English letters with length at most 10**
