Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly checks if a string can be rearranged to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. If the string contains exactly two unique characters, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. If the string contains more than two unique characters, it prints 'YES' and then prints the string sorted in ascending order unless the original string is already sorted, in which case it prints the string sorted in descending order. This ensures that the output string is always different from the original string.

Correctness: **True**
