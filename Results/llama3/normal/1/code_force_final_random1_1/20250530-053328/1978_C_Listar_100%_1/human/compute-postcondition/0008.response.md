Functionality: **This function takes no arguments and returns no value. It first checks the value of 'n' returned by function func_4(). If 'n' is 0, it prints 'NO' and ends. If 'n' is not 0, it calls function func_1() with 'n' and 'k' as arguments, assigns the result to 'l', and then calls function func_5() with 'l' as an argument, without producing any output.**
