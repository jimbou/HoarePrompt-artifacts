This function takes two integers, n and k, as input and returns a list of integers from 1 to n. It modifies the list based on the value of k, potentially removing elements from the list through recursive calls to other functions (func_2 and func_3). The function returns the modified list, which may or may not be the original list of integers from 1 to n, depending on the value of k.
