Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when k is an odd number correctly. In the function func_4, it checks if k is odd and returns (0, 0) immediately, which means it will print "NO" without trying to find a permutation. However, it is possible to find a permutation with an odd Manhattan value. For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, a possible permutation is [1, 3, 2] with a Manhattan value of 1.

The program should be modified to handle the case when k is an odd number correctly. One possible solution is to use a similar approach as when k is even, but with some adjustments to handle the odd case.
