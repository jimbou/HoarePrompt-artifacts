Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, and they are the output of function func_4(). Additionally, n is not equal to 0, l is the output of function func_1(n, k)**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the output of function func_1(n, k) to variable l. The second line calls function func_5(l) but does not assign its output to any variable. 

Since the code does not modify the values of n and k, they retain their initial values. The value of l is determined by the output of function func_1(n, k), which is not specified in the problem. Therefore, the final state includes the values of n and k, as well as the newly introduced variable l, which is the output of func_1(n, k).
