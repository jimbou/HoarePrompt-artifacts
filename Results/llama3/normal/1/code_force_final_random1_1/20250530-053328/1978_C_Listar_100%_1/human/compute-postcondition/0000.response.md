Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, and they are the output of function func_4().**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are assigned the output of the function `func_4()`, which means they are now within the specified ranges. The rest of the information from the initial state is still valid, as the code only assigns new values to `n` and `k` without affecting any other variables or conditions.
