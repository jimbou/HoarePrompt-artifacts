The first line of code decrements the value of the first element of `list` by its own value, effectively setting it to 0. The second line decrements the value of the second element of `list` by twice the value of the first element, which is now 0, so the second element remains unchanged. The third line decrements the value of the third element of `list` by the value of the first element, which is now 0, so the third element also remains unchanged. The fourth element of `list` is not affected by any of the lines of code.

Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 1, the third element is greater than 1, and the fourth element is greater than 0; n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of list; i is 1.**
