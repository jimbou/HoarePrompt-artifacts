    #State: list is a list of integers with at least n integers, n is a non-negative integer such that n <= len(list), i is n-1. If all elements of the list up to the nth element are 0, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.

    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements of the list up to the nth element are 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if the first n elements of a given list are all zeros. It accepts a list of integers and a non-negative integer n as parameters, where n is less than or equal to the length of the list. The function returns True if all elements up to the nth element are 0, and False otherwise.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of list.

Additionally, if func_1(list, n) returns True, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function modifies a list of integers by iteratively subtracting values from adjacent elements, effectively reducing the list while preserving certain properties. It then checks the modified list using the func_1 function and prints 'YES' if the check passes, otherwise prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but modifies the input list in-place.
