Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem. The operation states that Rudolf can choose an index i (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

However, the program implements this operation as:

    list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
    list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]

This is not equivalent to the operation described in the problem. The correct implementation should be:

    list[i - 1] -= 1
    list[i] -= 2
    list[i + 1] -= 1

Additionally, the program does not correctly check if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. The function func_1 only checks if all elements are already zero, but it does not check if it is possible to make them zero using the operations.

A correct implementation would need to check if the sum of the elements at each index is a multiple of 3, and if the sum of the elements at each index is non-negative. If these conditions are met, then it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.
