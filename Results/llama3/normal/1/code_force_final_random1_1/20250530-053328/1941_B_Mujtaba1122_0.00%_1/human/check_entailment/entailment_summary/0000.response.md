Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i, where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1.

Function func_1 checks if the first n elements of a given list are all zeros. This function is used by func_2 to check if the modified list is all zeros.

Function func_2 modifies the input list by iteratively applying the operation to the elements. It then uses func_1 to check if the modified list is all zeros. If it is, the function prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation of func_2. The while loop condition is incorrect, as it checks if list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0. This condition does not accurately represent the operation, as it does not consider the case where list[i] is 1 and list[i - 1] and list[i + 1] are 0.

Moreover, the operation inside the while loop is also incorrect. The correct operation should be list[i - 1] -= 1, list[i] -= 2, and list[i + 1] -= 1, without multiplying by list[i - 1].

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
