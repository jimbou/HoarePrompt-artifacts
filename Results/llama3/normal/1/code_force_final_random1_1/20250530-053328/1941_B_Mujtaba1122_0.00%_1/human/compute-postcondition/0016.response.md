The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3 and is equal to the length of list. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is greater than 2 and is 2 less than its original value, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, the fifth element is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged; n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of list and n is greater than 4; i is 3**
