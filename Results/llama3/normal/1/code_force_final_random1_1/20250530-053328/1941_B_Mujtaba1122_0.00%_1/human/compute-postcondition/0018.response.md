Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is greater than 2 and is 4 less than its original value, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is 4 less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, the fifth element is greater than 0 and is 3 less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged; n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of list and n is greater than 4; i is 3**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The list has been modified as follows: the third element is now 4 less than its original value, the fourth element is 4 less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, and the fifth element is 3 less than its original value minus the original value of the second element. The first and second elements remain unchanged. The rest of the elements in the list remain unchanged. The value of n remains the same, which is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is equal to the length of the list. The value of i remains 3.
