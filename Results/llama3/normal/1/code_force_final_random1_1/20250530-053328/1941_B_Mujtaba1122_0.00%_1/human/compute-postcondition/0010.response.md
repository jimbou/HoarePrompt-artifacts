Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 1 and is 1 less than its original value, the third element is greater than 1 and is 2 times less than its original value minus 2 times the original value of the second element, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged; n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of list and n is greater than 3; i is 2**

In this output state, the first element of the list remains 0. The second element is greater than 1 and is 1 less than its original value. The third element is greater than 1 and is 2 times less than its original value minus 2 times the original value of the second element. The fourth element is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value minus the original value of the second element. The rest of the elements in the list remain unchanged. The value of n remains the same, an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5, equal to the length of the list, and greater than 3. The value of i remains 2.
