Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is 0, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is equal to the original value of the fourth element minus the original value of the second element, the fifth element is greater than 0 and is equal to the original value of the fifth element minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged; n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of list and n is greater than 4; i is 3**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 0, the third element is 0, the fourth and fifth elements are greater than 0 and are equal to their original values minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. The value of n remains the same, and i remains at 3.
