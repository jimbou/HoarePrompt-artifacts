Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than -1, and the third element is greater than -1; n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of list; i is 1**

The first line of the code subtracts the value of the first element of the list from itself, effectively setting it to 0. The second line subtracts twice the value of the first element from the second element, which results in the second element being greater than -1 since the first element is now 0. The third line subtracts the value of the first element from the third element, which does not change the third element's value since the first element is now 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
