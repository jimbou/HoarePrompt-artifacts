To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`). Since `n` is already given to be between 3 and 2 * 10^5, we can conclude that `n` is indeed greater than 1.

For the loop to start executing, `i` should be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 1.

State: **`list` is a list of integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of list, `i` is 1**
