The code snippet modifies the list and its elements based on the value of the variable i. The first line subtracts the value of the element at index i-1 from itself, effectively setting it to 0. The second line subtracts twice the value of the element at index i-1 from the element at index i. Since the element at index i-1 is now 0, this line does not change the value of the element at index i. The third line subtracts the value of the element at index i-1 from the element at index i+1. Again, since the element at index i-1 is now 0, this line does not change the value of the element at index i+1.

Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is greater than 1, and the third element is greater than 0; n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of list; i is 1**
