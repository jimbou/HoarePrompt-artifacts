Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by using two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero, and `func_2` applies the operation described in the problem to the list.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. In `func_2`, the while loop condition is incorrect. It checks if `list[i] > 1` and `list[i - 1] > 0` and `list[i + 1] > 0`, but it should check if `list[i] >= 2` and `list[i - 1] >= 1` and `list[i + 1] >= 1`. This is because the operation can only be applied if the current element is at least 2 and the adjacent elements are at least 1.

2. Inside the while loop, the operations are incorrect. The correct operations should be `list[i - 1] -= 1`, `list[i] -= 2`, and `list[i + 1] -= 1`. However, the program is multiplying the values by `list[i - 1]`, which is incorrect.

3. The program does not handle the case where the first or last element of the list is non-zero. The operation can only be applied to elements in the middle of the list (i.e., `i` ranges from 1 to `n - 2`), but the program does not check if the first or last element can be made zero.

4. The program does not check if the sum of the elements in the list is even. If the sum is odd, it is impossible to make all elements zero using the operation.

Due to these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
