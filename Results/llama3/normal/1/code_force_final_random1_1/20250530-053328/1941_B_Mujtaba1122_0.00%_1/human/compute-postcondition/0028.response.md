Postcondition: ***list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is 0, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is equal to the original value of the fourth element minus the original value of the second element, the fifth element is greater than 0 and is equal to the original value of the fifth element minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged; n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of list and n is greater than 4; i is n - 2; and func_1(list, n) returns False***
