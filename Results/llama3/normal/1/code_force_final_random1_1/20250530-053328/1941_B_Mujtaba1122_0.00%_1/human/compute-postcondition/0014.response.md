Output State: **list is a list of integers where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, the third element is greater than 2 and is 2 less than its original value, the fourth element is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, the fifth element is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value minus the original value of the second element, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged; n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is equal to the length of list and n is greater than 3; i is 2**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The list has been modified such that the second element is now 0, and the third, fourth, and fifth elements have been decreased by 2, 2, and 2 respectively, compared to their original values. The rest of the elements in the list remain unchanged. The value of n remains the same, which is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5, and is equal to the length of the list. The value of i is still 2.
