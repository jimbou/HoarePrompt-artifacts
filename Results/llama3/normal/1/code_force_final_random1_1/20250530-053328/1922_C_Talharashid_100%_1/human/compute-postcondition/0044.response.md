Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from stdin, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` have been updated to the integers that were inputted from stdin. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that stdin is now empty since it was used to input the values of `x` and `y`.
