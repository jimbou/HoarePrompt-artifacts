The code prints the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`. Where `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from stdin and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, which are now empty.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are the values in dictionary d2 corresponding to keys y and x respectively)**
