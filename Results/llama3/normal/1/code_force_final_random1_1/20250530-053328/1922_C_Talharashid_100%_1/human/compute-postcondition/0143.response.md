Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, where if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`, otherwise `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. `d2[i]` is now `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from stdin and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, which are now empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `d2[i]` has been updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
