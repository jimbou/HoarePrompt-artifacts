To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, because the loop starts from `n - 2` and goes down to 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 3.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, its initial value should be `n - 2` for the loop to start correctly.

The other variables, such as `l`, `d1`, and `d2`, are not directly related to the loop execution and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `n - 1` and the value is 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**
