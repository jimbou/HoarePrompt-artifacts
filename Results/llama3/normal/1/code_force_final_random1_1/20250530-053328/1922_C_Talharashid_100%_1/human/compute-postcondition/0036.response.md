Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers, and the current value of `y` is greater than the current value of `x`. stdin contains no input.**
