Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys 2, 3, and 4, `d2` is an empty dictionary, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, then `d1` has values 1, 2, and 3 for keys 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Otherwise, `d1` has values 1, `l[2] - l[1] + 1`, and either 1 + `l[2] - l[1] + 1` or `l[3] - l[2] + (l[2] - l[1] + 1)` for keys 2, 3, and 4 respectively, depending on whether the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`.**
