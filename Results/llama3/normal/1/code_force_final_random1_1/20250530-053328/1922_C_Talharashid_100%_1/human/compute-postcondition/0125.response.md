To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from stdin and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, which are now empty.**

Note that the states of `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, as they are not modified in the loop head.
