The code prints the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`, where `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs that depend on the differences between consecutive elements of list `l`, `y` is an integer less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is an integer.

Output: **the difference between the value in dictionary d2 at key y and the value in dictionary d2 at key x**
