Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, stdin contains no input, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from stdin and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, which are now empty. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at key `y` and the value of `d1` at key `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at keys `y` and `x` is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `i`, `n`, `l`, and `d1` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is greater than or equal to 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `j` is equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has executed `m` times. The values of `x` and `y` are the last two integers inputted from stdin, and they are now empty. The loop has printed the differences between the values of `d1` or `d2` at keys `y` and `x` for each iteration, depending on whether `y` is greater than `x`.
