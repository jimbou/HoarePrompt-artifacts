State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys 2 and 3, `d2` is an empty dictionary, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, then `d1` has values 1 and 2 for keys 2 and 3 respectively. Otherwise, `d1` has values 1 and `l[2] - l[1] + 1` for keys 2 and 3 respectively.**
