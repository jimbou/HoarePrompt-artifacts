Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, where `d1[4]` is assigned the value `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from stdin and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, which are now empty.**

In this output state, the value of `d1[4]` has been updated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `d1[4]` is now dependent on the values of `l[3]`, `l[2]`, and `d1[3]`.
