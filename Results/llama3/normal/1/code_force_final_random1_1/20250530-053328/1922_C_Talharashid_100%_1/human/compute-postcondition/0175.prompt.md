Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of distinct non-decreasing integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of distinct integers. The first integer is greater than or equal to 2, the list of integers has a length equal to the first integer, the second integer is greater than or equal to 1, and the list of pairs has a length equal to the second integer. Each pair of integers is within the range of the list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    d1 = defaultdict(int)
    d2 = defaultdict(int)
    d1[2] = 1
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
            d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
        else:
            d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
    d2[n - 1] = 1
    for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
        if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
            d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
        else:
            d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
    m = int(input())
    for j in range(m):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if y > x:
            print(d1[y] - d1[x])
        else:
            print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, stdin contains no input, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from stdin and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, which are now empty. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at key `y` and the value of `d1` at key `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at keys `y` and `x` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is -1, `n` is at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from `stdin` and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from `stdin`, which are now empty. The value returned by `int(input())` is greater than 2. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at key `y` and the value of `d1` at key `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at keys `y` and `x` is printed. Additionally, for all `i` from 2 to `n - 2`, if the difference between the `i + 1`th element of `l` and the `i`th element of `l` is less than the difference between the `i`th element of `l` and the `i - 1`th element of `l`, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. The value of `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`. Otherwise, the difference between the `i`th element of `l` and the `i - 1`th element of `l` is less than or equal to the difference between the `i + 1`th element of `l` and the `i`th element of `l`. The value of `d2[i]` is updated to be 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, where if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`, otherwise `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from stdin and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, which are now empty. The program has printed the differences between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` if `y` is greater than `x`, otherwise it has printed the differences between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`, for all `m` iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
