The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1, so `i` is `n - 4`. 
State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`. If `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**
