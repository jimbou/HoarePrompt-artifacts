Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains `n - 3`, and `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 3. The list `l` and dictionary `d1` remain unchanged. The dictionary `d2` has been updated such that the value associated with the key `i` (which is `n - 3`) is now the result of the expression `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.
