Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `n - 1` and the value is 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The values of `d1` depend on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`. If the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `l` is less than the difference between the `(i-1)-th` and `(i-2)-th` elements of `l`, then the value of `d1` for key `i+1` is 1 plus the value of `d1` for key `i`. Otherwise, the value of `d1` for key `i+1` is the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `l` plus the value of `d1` for key `i`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
    if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
        d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
    else:
        d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`. If the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `l` is less than the difference between the `(i+1)-th` element and the `i-th` element of `l`, then `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `n - 1` has a value of 1 and key `n - 2` has a value of 2 plus the value of key `n - 1` in `d2`. Otherwise, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is `n - 1` and the value is 1, and the key is `n - 2` and the value is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`. If `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n - 4`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`. If `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
