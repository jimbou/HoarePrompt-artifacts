Output State: **`i` is equal to the value returned by `int(input())`, `n` is at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, where if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`, otherwise `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from stdin and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, which are now empty. The program has printed the differences between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` if `y` is greater than `x`, otherwise it has printed the differences between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`, for all `m` iterations.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, `j`, `x`, and `y` have the values that they had after the last iteration of the loop. The program has printed the differences between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` if `y` is greater than `x`, otherwise it has printed the differences between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`, for all `m` iterations.
