Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, where if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`, otherwise `d1[4]` is assigned the value `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from stdin and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, which are now empty. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[5]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[4]`. Otherwise, `d1[5]` is assigned the value `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.***
