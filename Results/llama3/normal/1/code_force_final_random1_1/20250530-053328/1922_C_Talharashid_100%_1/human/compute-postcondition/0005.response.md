Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with a key of 2 and a value of 1, `d2` is an empty dictionary, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than or equal to the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`***
