Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are assigned the values of the input integers from stdin, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `d1` and `d2` depend on the differences between consecutive elements of the list `l`. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the yth and xth elements of `d1` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the yth and xth elements of the list `d2` is printed.**
