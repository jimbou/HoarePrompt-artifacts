Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `n - 1` and the value is 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The values of `d1` depend on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`. If the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `l` is less than the difference between the `(i-1)-th` and `(i-2)-th` elements of `l`, then the value of `d1` for key `i+1` is 1 plus the value of `d1` for key `i`. Otherwise, the value of `d1` for key `i+1` is the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `l` plus the value of `d1` for key `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains the same as `n - 1`, `n` is still an integer, and `l` is still a list of integers. The dictionary `d1` remains unchanged, but a new dictionary `d2` is created with a single key-value pair where the key is `n - 1` and the value is 1. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two inputs. The values of `d1` still depend on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, following the same rules as before.
