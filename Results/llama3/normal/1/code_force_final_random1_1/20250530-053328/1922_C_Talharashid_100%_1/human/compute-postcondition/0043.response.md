State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers, stdin contains no input. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at key `y` and the value of `d1` at key `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the value of `d2` at key `y` and the value of `d2` at key `x` is printed.**
