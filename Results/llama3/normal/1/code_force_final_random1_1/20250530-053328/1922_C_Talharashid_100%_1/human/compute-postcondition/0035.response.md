Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `n`, `l`, `d1`, `d2`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. However, `x` and `y` are assigned integer values from the input, but since stdin contains no input, `x` and `y` are not assigned any values. Therefore, the output state includes `x` and `y` as integers, but their values are undefined.
