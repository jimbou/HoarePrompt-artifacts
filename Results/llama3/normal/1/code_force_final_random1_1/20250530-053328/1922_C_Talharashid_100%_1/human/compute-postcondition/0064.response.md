Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` where `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `stdin` contains no input, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from `stdin` and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from `stdin`, which are now empty. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at key `y` and the value of `d1` at key `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at keys `y` and `x` is printed. The value returned by `int(input())` is greater than 2. The difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is not less than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `d1` at key `i + 2` is updated to be the sum of the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` and the value of `d1` at key `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
