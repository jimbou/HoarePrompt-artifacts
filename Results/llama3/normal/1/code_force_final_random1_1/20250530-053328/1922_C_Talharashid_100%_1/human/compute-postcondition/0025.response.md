Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `d2[i]` has been updated to be 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still `n - 3`, `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is still a list of integers, and `d1` is still a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`.
