The code prints the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.
Since `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.
Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are values in dictionary d2 that depend on the differences between consecutive elements of list l)**
