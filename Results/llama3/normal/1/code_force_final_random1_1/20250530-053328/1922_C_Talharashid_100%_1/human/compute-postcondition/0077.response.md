Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `stdin` contains no input, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from `stdin` and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from `stdin`, which are now empty. The value returned by `int(input())` is greater than 2. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at key `y` and the value of `d1` at key `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at keys `y` and `x` is printed. Additionally, for all `i` from 2 to `n - 2`, if the difference between the `i + 1`th element of `l` and the `i`th element of `l` is less than the difference between the `i`th element of `l` and the `i - 1`th element of `l`, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. The current value of `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`.***
