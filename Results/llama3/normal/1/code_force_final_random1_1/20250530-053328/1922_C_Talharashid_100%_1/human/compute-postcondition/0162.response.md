The code prints the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`, where `y` is greater than `x`. 

Since `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, the value of `d1[y]` depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` from index 2 to `y`, and the value of `d1[x]` depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` from index 2 to `x`. 

However, since the exact values of `l`, `x`, and `y` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `d1[y] - d1[x]`. 

But based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the value of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] and d1[x] are the values of d1 at indices y and x respectively, and y is greater than x)**
