Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, l is a list of integers, d1 is a dictionary with keys from 2 to n, d2 is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key i has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of l, m is greater than or equal to 0, j is equal to m, stdin contains no input, x and y are integers that were inputted from stdin and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, which are now empty. If y is greater than x, the difference between the value of d1 at key y and the value of d1 at key x is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of d2 at keys y and x is printed. The value returned by int(input()) is greater than 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
        d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
    else:
        d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `stdin` contains no input, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from `stdin` and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from `stdin`, which are now empty. The value returned by `int(input())` is greater than 2. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at key `y` and the value of `d1` at key `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at keys `y` and `x` is printed. Additionally, if the difference between the third element of `l` and the second element of `l` is less than the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l`, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is at least 4, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `stdin` contains no input, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from `stdin` and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from `stdin`, which are now empty. The value returned by `int(input())` is greater than 2. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at key `y` and the value of `d1` at key `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at keys `y` and `x` is printed. Additionally, if the difference between the third element of `l` and the second element of `l` is less than the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l`, then `d1[5]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[4]`. Otherwise, `d1[5]` is equal to `l[3] - l[2] + d1[4]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 4, `n` is at least 5, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `stdin` contains no input, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from `stdin` and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from `stdin`, which are now empty. The value returned by `int(input())` is greater than 2. If `y` is greater than `x`, the difference between the value of `d1` at key `y` and the value of `d1` at key `x` is printed. Otherwise, the difference between the values of `d2` at keys `y` and `x` is printed. Additionally, if the difference between the third element of `l` and the second element of `l` is less than the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l`, then `d1[5]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[4]`. Otherwise, `d1[5]` is equal to `l[3] - l[2] + d1[4]`. If the difference between the fifth element of `l` and the fourth element of `l` is less than the difference between the fourth element of `l` and the third element of `l`, then `d1[6]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[5]`. Otherwise, `d1[6]` is equal to `l[5] - l[4] + d1[5]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
