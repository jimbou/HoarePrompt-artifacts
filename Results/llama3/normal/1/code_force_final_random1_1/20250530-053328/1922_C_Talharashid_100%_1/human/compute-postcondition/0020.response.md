Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `n - 1` has a value of 1 and key `n - 2` has a value of 2 plus the value of key `n - 1` in `d2`, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `i` is such that the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `l` is less than the difference between the `(i+1)-th` element and the `i-th` element of `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `d2[i]` has been updated to 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`, which is 1 plus the value of key `n - 1` in `d2`. The value of `d2[i]` is now 2 plus the value of key `n - 1` in `d2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
