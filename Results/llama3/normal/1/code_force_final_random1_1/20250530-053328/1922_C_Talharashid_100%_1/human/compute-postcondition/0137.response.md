Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, where if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`, otherwise `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from stdin and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, which are now empty. The current value of `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `d2[i]` has been updated to be 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the values of `l`, `d1`, and `d2` are still valid, and the relationship between `l[i] - l[i - 1]` and `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is still maintained.
