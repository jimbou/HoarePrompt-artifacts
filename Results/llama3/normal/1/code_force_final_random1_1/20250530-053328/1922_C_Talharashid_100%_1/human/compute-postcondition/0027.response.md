Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`. If `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.***
