Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys 2, 3 and 4, `d2` is an empty dictionary, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, then `d1` has values 1, 2 and 3 for keys 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Otherwise, `d1` has values 1, `l[2] - l[1] + 1` and 1 + `l[2] - l[1] + 1` for keys 2, 3 and 4 respectively.**

In this output state, the value of `d1[i + 2]` is updated to `1 + d1[i + 1]`, where `i` is 2. This means that the value of `d1[4]` is set to `1 + d1[3]`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
