Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `n - 1` and the value is 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `i` is such that the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `l` is less than the difference between the `(i+1)-th` element and the `i-th` element of `l`.**
