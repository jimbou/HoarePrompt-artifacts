The code prints the difference between the values of `d1` at indices `y` and `x`. Since `d1` depends on the differences between consecutive elements of the list `l`, the exact values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` cannot be determined without knowing the specific elements of `l`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between these two values.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1[y] and d1[x] are values in the list d1 that depend on the differences between consecutive elements of the list l)**
