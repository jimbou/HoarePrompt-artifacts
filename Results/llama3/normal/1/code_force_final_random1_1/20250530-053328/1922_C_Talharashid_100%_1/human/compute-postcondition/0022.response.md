Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is `n - 1` and the value is 1, and the key is `n - 2` and the value is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. Additionally, the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in list `l` is greater than or equal to the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains `n - 2`, and `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 3. The list `l` remains unchanged. The dictionary `d1` still has keys from 2 to `n`. The dictionary `d2` now has two key-value pairs: one with key `n - 1` and value 1, and another with key `n - 2` and value `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two inputs. The relationship between the elements in list `l` at indices `i`, `i - 1`, and `i + 1` remains the same.
