The code prints the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`. Since `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, and `y` and `x` are integers where `y` is greater than `x`, the print statement will output the difference between the values associated with the keys `y` and `x` in the dictionary `d1`. However, the exact values of `y` and `x` are not provided, so we can't compute the exact numerical difference.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where y and x are integers, y is greater than x, and d1 is a dictionary with keys from 2 to n)**
