Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n, a list of n distinct non-decreasing integers, another integer m, and a list of m pairs of distinct integers. It then calculates and prints the differences between the values of two dictionaries, d1 and d2, for each pair of integers in the list of pairs. The dictionaries d1 and d2 are constructed based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list of integers. The function performs these calculations and prints the results for all test cases.**
