stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of distinct non-decreasing integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of distinct integers. The first integer is greater than or equal to 2, the list of integers has a length equal to the first integer, the second integer is greater than or equal to 1, and the list of pairs has a length equal to the second integer. Each pair of integers is within the range of the list of integers.
