Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from stdin and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, which are now empty. The difference between the element at index `i + 1` and `i` in `l` is greater than or equal to the difference between the element at index `i` and `i - 1` in `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `d1[i + 2]` has been updated to be the sum of the difference between the elements at indices `i + 1` and `i` in `l` and the value of `d1[i + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
