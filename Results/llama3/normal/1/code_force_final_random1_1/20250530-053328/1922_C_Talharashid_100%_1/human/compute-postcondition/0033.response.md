Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`. If the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `l` is less than the difference between the `(i+1)-th` element and the `i-th` element of `l`, then the value of `d2` for key `i` is 1 plus the value of `d2` for key `i + 1`. Otherwise, the value of `d2` for key `i` is the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `l` plus the value of `d2` for key `i + 1`. `m` is an integer, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `m` is introduced, which is assigned the value of an integer from the input. Since the input is consumed, the stdin is now empty.
