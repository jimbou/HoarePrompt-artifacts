Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys 2 and 3 and values 1 and 2 respectively, `d2` is an empty dictionary, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`**

In this output state, the value of `d1` has been updated to include a new key-value pair, where the key is `i + 2` (which is 3) and the value is `1 + d1[i + 1]` (which is 2). The other variables remain unchanged.
