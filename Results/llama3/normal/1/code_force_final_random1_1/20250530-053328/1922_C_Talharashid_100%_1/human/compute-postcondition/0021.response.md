Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`, `d2` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `n - 1` and the value is 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. Additionally, the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in list `l` is greater than or equal to the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i`***
