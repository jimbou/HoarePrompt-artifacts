Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, where `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from stdin and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, which are now empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `d1[i + 2]` has been updated to be 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
