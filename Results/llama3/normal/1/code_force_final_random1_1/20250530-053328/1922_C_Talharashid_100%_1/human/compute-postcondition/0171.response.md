The code prints the difference between the values of `d2` at indices `y` and `x`. Here, `d2` is a list whose elements depend on the differences between consecutive elements of the list `l`, and `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the input integers from stdin.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] and d2[x] are the values of d2 at indices y and x respectively, and y and x are the input integers from stdin)**
