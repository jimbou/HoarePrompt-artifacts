Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another. The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the cumulative costs of traveling from the first city to each subsequent city and from the last city to each previous city, respectively.

The program correctly handles the cases where the closest city is either the next city or the previous city, and it correctly calculates the costs of traveling between cities. The program also correctly handles the queries by printing the differences between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` if `y` is greater than `x`, and the differences between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` otherwise.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
