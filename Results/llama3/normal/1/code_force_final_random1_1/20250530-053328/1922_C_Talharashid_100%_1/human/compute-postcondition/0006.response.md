Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys 2 and 3 and values 1 and `l[2] - l[1] + 1` respectively, `d2` is an empty dictionary, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than or equal to the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains 1, `n` is still at least 3, and `l` is still a list of integers. The dictionary `d1` now has two key-value pairs: the key 2 maps to 1, and the key 3 maps to the difference between the third and second elements of `l` plus 1. The dictionary `d2` is still empty. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two inputs. The difference between the second and first elements of `l` is still less than or equal to the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`.
