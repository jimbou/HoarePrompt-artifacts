Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 4, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys 2, 3, and 4, `d2` is an empty dictionary, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is less than the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`, then `d1` has values 1, 2, and `l[3] - l[2] + 2` for keys 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Otherwise, `d1` has values 1, `l[2] - l[1] + 1`, and `l[3] - l[2] + (l[2] - l[1] + 1)` for keys 2, 3, and 4 respectively.**

In this output state, the value of `d1[i + 2]` is calculated based on the values of `l[i + 1]`, `l[i]`, and `d1[i + 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, and `d2` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two inputs. The values of `d1` are updated according to the conditions specified in the initial state.
