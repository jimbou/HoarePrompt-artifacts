Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n`. If the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `l` is less than the difference between the `(i+1)-th` element and the `i-th` element of `l`, then `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `n - 1` has a value of 1 and key `n - 2` has a value of 2 plus the value of key `n - 1` in `d2`. Otherwise, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is `n - 1` and the value is 1, and the key is `n - 2` and the value is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.***
