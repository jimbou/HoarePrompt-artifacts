State: **The program prints the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` if `y` is greater than `x`, otherwise it prints the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`. The values of `d1` and `d2` depend on the differences between consecutive elements of the list `l`, and the values of `x` and `y` are the input integers from stdin, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1**
