Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers, `d1` is a dictionary with keys from 2 to `n` and values that depend on the differences between consecutive elements of `l`, where if `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 plus the value of `d1[i + 1]`, otherwise `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key `i` has a value that depends on the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and `d2[n - 1]` is 1. If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is 1 plus the value of `d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. `m` is an integer greater than 1, `j` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers that were inputted from stdin and are assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, which are now empty. The program prints the difference between the value of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` if `y` is greater than `x`, otherwise it prints the difference between the value of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but `x` and `y` are now assigned the values of the two integers that were inputted from stdin, and the program prints the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` if `y` is greater than `x`, otherwise it prints the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.
