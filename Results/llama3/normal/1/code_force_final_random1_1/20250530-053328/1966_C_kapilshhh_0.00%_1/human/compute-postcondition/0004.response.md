Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with at least 2 elements and a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[1] - (arr[2] if 1 < n else 0) > 1` or False otherwise, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[1] - (arr[2] if 1 < n else 0) > 1`. If this condition is true, `dp` remains True; otherwise, it becomes False. The other variables remain unchanged.
