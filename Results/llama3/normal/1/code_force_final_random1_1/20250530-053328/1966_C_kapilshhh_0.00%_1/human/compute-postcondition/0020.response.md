Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with at least 3 elements and a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1` or False if `arr[3] - arr[4] <= 1` and `dp` was False, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 3, and 'Alice' is printed**.

In this output state, the value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp`. Since `i` is 3, the condition becomes `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1 or not dp`. If `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1`, then `dp` is set to True. Otherwise, if `arr[3] - arr[4] <= 1` and `dp` was previously False, then `dp` remains False. The other variables remain unchanged.
