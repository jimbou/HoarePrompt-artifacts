To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `arr`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(arr)` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(arr)`). 

Since `i` is used in the loop head, its value should be within the range of the loop. The loop starts from 1, so `i` should be at least 1.

State: **`tc` is a positive integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with at least 2 elements and a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 1, and 'Alice' is printed**
