stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦ a_n. t, n and a_i are positive integers such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 and 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
