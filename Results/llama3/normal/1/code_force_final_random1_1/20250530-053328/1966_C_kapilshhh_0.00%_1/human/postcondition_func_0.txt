This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'Alice' for each case. It accepts a series of test cases, where each case consists of a positive integer n and a list of distinct positive integers in descending order. The function checks if the difference between any two consecutive integers in the list is greater than 1 and prints 'Alice' accordingly. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty.
