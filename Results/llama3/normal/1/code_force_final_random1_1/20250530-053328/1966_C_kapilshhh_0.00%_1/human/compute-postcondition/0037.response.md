Output State: **tc is 0, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, arr is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, dp is True if arr[i] - arr[i+1] > 1 for any i in range(1, len(arr)-1) or False otherwise, stdin is empty, i is 0, and 'Alice' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `tc` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `n` will still be a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, representing the number of elements in the last test case. The list `arr` will contain distinct positive integers in descending order, with a 0 appended at the end, and its length will be at least `n+1`. The variable `dp` will be True if there exists an `i` in range(1, len(arr)-1) such that `arr[i] - arr[i+1] > 1`, and False otherwise. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, as all test cases have been processed. The variable `i` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. Finally, 'Alice' will be printed, indicating the result of the last test case.
