To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `tc` since it's the only variable in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `tc` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is a positive integer between 0 and 10^4. To guarantee the loop can execute again, `tc` must be greater than 0.

State: **tc is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, arr is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, dp is True if arr[i] - arr[i+1] > 1 for any i in range(1, len(arr)-1) or False otherwise, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is len(arr) - 2, and 'Alice' is printed**
