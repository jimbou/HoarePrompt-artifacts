Output: **`tc` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1` for all `i` in range(1, len(arr)) or False otherwise, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is len(arr) - 1, and 'Alice' is printed**
