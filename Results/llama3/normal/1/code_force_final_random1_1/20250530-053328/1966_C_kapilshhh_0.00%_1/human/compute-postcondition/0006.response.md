Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with at least 3 elements and a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[2] - (arr[3] if 2 < n else 0) > 1` or False if `arr[1] - (arr[2] if 1 < n else 0) <= 1`, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `tc` remains unchanged as a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5. The list `arr` remains unchanged with distinct positive integers in descending order and a 0 appended at the end. The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[2] - (arr[3] if 2 < n else 0) > 1`. If this condition is true, `dp` becomes True; otherwise, it becomes False if the previous value of `dp` was True and `arr[1] - (arr[2] if 1 < n else 0) <= 1`. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains unchanged as t-2. The value of `i` remains unchanged as 2.
