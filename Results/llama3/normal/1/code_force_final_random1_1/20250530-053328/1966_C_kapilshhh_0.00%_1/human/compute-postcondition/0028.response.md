Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is True if arr[1] - arr[2] > 1, else False, `i` is 1, 'Alice' is printed, stdin contains t-6 test cases**

The value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp`. Since `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is the second element in the list `arr`, and `arr[i + 1]` is the third element. The condition checks if the difference between the second and third elements is greater than 1, or if `dp` is currently False. If either of these conditions is true, `dp` is set to True; otherwise, it is set to False. The other variables remain unchanged.
