The only variable in the loop head is `tc`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, which already ensures that `tc` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`tc` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦ a_n. n and a_i are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.**
