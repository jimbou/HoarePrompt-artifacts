Output State: **tc is a positive integer between 0 and 10^4, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, arr is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, dp is True if arr[i] - arr[i+1] > 1 for any i in range(1, len(arr)-1) or False otherwise, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is len(arr) - 2, and 'Alice' is printed**

The value of tc is decremented by 1, so it is now a positive integer between 0 and 10^4. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases. The output state is the same as the initial state except for the value of tc.
