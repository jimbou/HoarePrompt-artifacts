Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is True if arr[2] - arr[3] > 1, else False, `i` is 2, 'Alice' is printed, stdin contains t-6 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `dp` is updated based on the condition `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp`. Since `i` is 2, the condition becomes `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not dp`. The value of `dp` is now dependent on the difference between the third and fourth elements of the `arr` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
