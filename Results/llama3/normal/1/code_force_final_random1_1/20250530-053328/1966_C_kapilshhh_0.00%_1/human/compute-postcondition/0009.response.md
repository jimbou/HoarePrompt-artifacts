Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1` for all `i` in range(1, len(arr)) or False otherwise, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is len(arr) - 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

- `tc` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5.
- `arr` remains a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end.
- `dp` will be True if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element) is greater than 1, or False otherwise.
- `stdin` still contains t-2 test cases.
- `i` will be equal to the second last index of `arr` (i.e., `len(arr) - 1`).
