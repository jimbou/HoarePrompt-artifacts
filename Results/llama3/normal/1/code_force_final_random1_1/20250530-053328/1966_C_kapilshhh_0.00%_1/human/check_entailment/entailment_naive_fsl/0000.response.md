Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the line where it prints the result. The program always prints 'Alice', regardless of the value of the variable dp. This means that the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the input.

For example, if the input is:

2
1 7

The program should print 'Bob', but it will print 'Alice'. This is because the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game.

To fix this, the program should print 'Alice' if dp is True and 'Bob' if dp is False. The corrected line should be:

print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
