Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with at least 2 elements and a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or False if `arr[2] - arr[3] <= 1` and `arr[1] - arr[2] <= 1`, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 2, and 'Alice' is printed**

In this output state, the value of `dp` has been updated based on the condition `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp`. Since `i` is 2, the condition checks if `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or if `dp` is False (which means `arr[1] - arr[2] <= 1`). The other variables remain unchanged.
