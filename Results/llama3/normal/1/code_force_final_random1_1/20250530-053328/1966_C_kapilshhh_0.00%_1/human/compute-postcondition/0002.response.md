Output State: **tc is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, arr is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, dp is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `tc` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to be the number of distinct positive integers in the input, which is between 1 and 2*10^5. The `arr` list now contains these distinct positive integers in descending order, with a 0 appended at the end. The `dp` variable is set to True. The stdin now contains t-2 test cases, as one test case has been processed by the code.
