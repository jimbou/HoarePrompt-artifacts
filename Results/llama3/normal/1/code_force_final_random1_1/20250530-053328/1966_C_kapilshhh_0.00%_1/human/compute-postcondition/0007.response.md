To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `arr`. 

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `arr`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `arr` has at least 3 elements and a 0 appended at the end. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3.

State: **`tc` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with at least 3 elements and a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[2] - (arr[3] if 2 < n else 0) > 1` or False if `arr[1] - (arr[2] if 1 < n else 0) <= 1`, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is 3**
