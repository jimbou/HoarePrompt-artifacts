Output State: **tc is a positive integer greater than 0 and is one less than its initial value, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, arr is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least n+1 elements, dp is True if arr[n] - arr[n+1] > 1, else False, i is n, 'Alice' is printed, stdin contains t-7 test cases, and 'Alice' is printed**

In this output state, the value of tc has been decremented by 1, but it is still a positive integer greater than 0. The values of n, arr, dp, i, and the printed messages remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
