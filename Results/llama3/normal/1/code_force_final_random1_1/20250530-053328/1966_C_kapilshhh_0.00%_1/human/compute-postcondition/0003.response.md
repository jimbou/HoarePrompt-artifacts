To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` has at least 2 elements (since the range starts from 1), and `i` is initialized to 1.

State: **`tc` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with at least 2 elements and a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is 1**
