The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and arr. If i is less than len(arr), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, arr has at least 2 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time i must be 2 and arr must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`tc` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least 3 elements, `dp` is True if arr[1] - arr[2] > 1, else False, `i` is 2, 'Alice' is printed, stdin contains t-6 test cases**
