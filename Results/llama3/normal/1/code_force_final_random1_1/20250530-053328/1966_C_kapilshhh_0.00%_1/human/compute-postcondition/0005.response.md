To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `arr`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `arr` has at least 2 elements with a 0 appended at the end. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `arr`. Since `i` is 1, it must be incremented by 1 to 2 for the loop to execute again. The length of `arr` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`tc` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with at least 3 elements and a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[1] - (arr[2] if 1 < n else 0) > 1` or False otherwise, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is 2**
