Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1` for all `i` in range(1, len(arr)) or False otherwise, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `i` is len(arr) - 1, and 'Alice' is printed**

In this output state, the value of `tc` has been decremented by 1, so it is now a positive integer between 0 and 10^4. The values of `n`, `arr`, `dp`, `stdin`, `i`, and the printed output 'Alice' remain unchanged.
