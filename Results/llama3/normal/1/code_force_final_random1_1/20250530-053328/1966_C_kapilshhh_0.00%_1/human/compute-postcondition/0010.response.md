Based on the precondition, the code will print 'Alice' regardless of the value of `dp`. The `if` condition in the `print` statement is always true because it checks if `dp` is true, and if it is, it prints 'Alice'. However, if `dp` is false, the `else` clause also prints 'Alice'. Therefore, the output will always be 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
