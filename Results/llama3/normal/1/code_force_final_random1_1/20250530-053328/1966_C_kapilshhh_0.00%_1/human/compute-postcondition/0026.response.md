Output State: **tc is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, arr is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, dp is True, i is len(arr) - 2, 'Alice' is printed, stdin contains t-6 test cases**

Explanation:
The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n. Since stdin contains t-5 test cases, it now contains t-6 test cases. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin, removes duplicates, sorts them in descending order, and appends a 0 at the end. This list is assigned to arr. The third line sets dp to True. The fourth line assigns the length of arr minus 1 to n. The value of i is not affected by the code and remains len(arr) - 2. The value of tc is not affected by the code and remains a positive integer greater than 0. 'Alice' is printed as per the initial state.
