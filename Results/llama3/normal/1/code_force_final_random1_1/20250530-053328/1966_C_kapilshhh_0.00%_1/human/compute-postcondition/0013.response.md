The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is a positive integer between 0 and 10^4, so for the loop to be executed one more time, `tc` must be greater than 0. Since `tc` is already a positive integer, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`tc` is a positive integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1` for all `i` in range(1, len(arr)) or False otherwise, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `i` is len(arr) - 1, and 'Alice' is printed**
