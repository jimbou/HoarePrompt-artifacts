Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tc` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦ a_n. n and a_i are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
Code of the loop:
while tc > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True
        ) + [0]
    dp = True
    n = len(arr) - 1
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        dp = arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp
    print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')
    tc -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is a positive integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `arr` is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1` for all `i` in range(1, len(arr)) or False otherwise, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `i` is len(arr) - 1, and 'Alice' is printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: tc is a positive integer between 0 and 10^4, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, arr is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end, dp is True if arr[i] - arr[i+1] > 1 for any i in range(1, len(arr)-1) or False otherwise, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is len(arr) - 2, and 'Alice' is printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: tc is a positive integer greater than 0 and is one less than its initial value, n is a positive integer between 1 and 2*10^5, arr is a list of distinct positive integers in descending order with a 0 appended at the end and must have at least n+1 elements, dp is True if arr[n] - arr[n+1] > 1, else False, i is n, 'Alice' is printed, stdin contains t-7 test cases, and 'Alice' is printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
