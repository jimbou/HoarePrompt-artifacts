Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦ a_n. n and a_i are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.**

In this output state, the variable `tc` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each with two lines as described in the initial state. The values of n and a_i are still positive integers within the specified ranges, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
