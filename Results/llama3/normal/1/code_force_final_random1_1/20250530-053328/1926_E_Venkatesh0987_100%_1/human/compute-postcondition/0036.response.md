Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is n, i must be greater than 2, d is 0, h is 0, p is 3, g is (n + 1) // 2 + 1 // 2, _ is an integer incremented by the number of iterations of the loop**

The code modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by the value of `(h + 1) // 2`, which is equivalent to `1 // 2` since `h` is 0. Therefore, `g` becomes `(n + 1) // 2 + 1 // 2`. The second line decrements `h` by the value of `(h + 1) // 2`, which is also `1 // 2`, making `h` equal to 0. The third line increments `p` by 1, making `p` equal to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
