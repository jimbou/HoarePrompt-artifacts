To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `p <= i - 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `s` is `n`
- `i` is the number of iterations of the loop
- `d` is 0
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `_` is an integer incremented by the number of iterations of the loop
- `stdin` is empty

The variables in the loop head are `p` and `i`. According to the condition `p <= i - 1`, for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than 1 since `p` is 1.

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is `i`, which must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is `n`, `i` must be greater than 1, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `_` is an integer incremented by the number of iterations of the loop, `stdin` is empty**
