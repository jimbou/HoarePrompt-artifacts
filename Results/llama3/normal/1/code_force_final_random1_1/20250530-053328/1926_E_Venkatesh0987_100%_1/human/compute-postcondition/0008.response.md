Output State: **n is greater than 0, k is an integer and must be greater than the increased value of s, s is greater than 0 and increased by half of the original value of d plus 0.5, i is 3, d is greater than 0 and decreased by half of the original value of d plus 0.5, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty**

The first line increments `s` by half of the original value of `d` plus 0.5. Since `d` is greater than 0 and decreased by half of the original value of `d` plus 0.5, the original value of `d` is sufficiently large to remain greater than 0 after the decrease. The second line decrements `d` by half of the original value of `d` plus 0.5. The third line increments `i` by 1. No other variables are affected.
