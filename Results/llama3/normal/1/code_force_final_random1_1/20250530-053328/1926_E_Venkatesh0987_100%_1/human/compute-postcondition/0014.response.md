The variables in the loop head are p and i, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables p and i. If p is less than or equal to i - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, p is greater than or equal to 2 and i is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, p must be less than or equal to i - 1, so we need to adjust the state of i to be greater than p + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **n is greater than 0, k is an integer, s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than p + 1, d is greater than or equal to 0, h is less than or equal to n - 1, p is greater than or equal to 2, g is at least 2, _ is 0, stdin is empty**
