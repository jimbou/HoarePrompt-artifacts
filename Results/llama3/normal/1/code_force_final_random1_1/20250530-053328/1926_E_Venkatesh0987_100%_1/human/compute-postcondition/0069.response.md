Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, s is an integer, i is an integer, d is an integer, h is an integer, p is an integer, g is an integer, _ is an integer incremented by either 1 or i, and either the value 2 is printed and f is k - g, or the value 2 * k - 1 is printed, depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not. If k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, then n is greater than 0, k is greater than 0, s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than or equal to 1, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, and y is 2. If k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then n is an integer, k is an integer, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, and the value 2 * k - 1 is printed, where k is an integer and the value of 2 * k - 1 is an odd number less than or equal to n.***
