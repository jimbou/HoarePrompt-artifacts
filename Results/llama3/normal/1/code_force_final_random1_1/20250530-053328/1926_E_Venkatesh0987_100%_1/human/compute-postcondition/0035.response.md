According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 2 and `i` is greater than 1. `i` being greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` must be greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is n, i must be greater than 2, d is 0, h is 0, p is 2, g is (n + 1) // 2, _ is an integer incremented by the number of iterations of the loop**
