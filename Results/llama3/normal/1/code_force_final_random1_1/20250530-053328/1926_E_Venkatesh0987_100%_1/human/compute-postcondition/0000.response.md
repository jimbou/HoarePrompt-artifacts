To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the `input()` function.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. If this value is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since stdin contains multiple lines of input, we need to adjust the state of the input to ensure that it contains at least one line with a valid integer value.

State: **stdin contains at least one line with a valid integer value t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4), _ is 0**
