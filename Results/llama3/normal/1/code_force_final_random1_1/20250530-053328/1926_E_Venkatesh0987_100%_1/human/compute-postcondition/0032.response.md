Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is n, i is the number of iterations of the loop, d is 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is an integer incremented by the number of iterations of the loop, stdin is empty**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `s` has reached the value of `n`, the variable `i` has been incremented by the number of iterations of the loop, and the variable `d` has been reduced to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
