Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, _ is an integer incremented by 1, stdin is empty**

The code block assigns new values to the variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g`. The first line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line initializes `s` to 0. The third line initializes `i` to 0. The fourth line assigns the value of `n` to `d`. The fifth line assigns the value of `n` to `h`. The sixth line initializes `p` to 1. The seventh line initializes `g` to 0. The eighth line does not affect any variables. The value of `_` is incremented by 1, but its exact value is not specified. The input is empty, so `stdin` remains empty.
