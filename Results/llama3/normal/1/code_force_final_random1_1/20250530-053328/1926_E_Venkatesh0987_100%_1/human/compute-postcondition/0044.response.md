The code prints the result of the expression `2 * k - 1`, where `k` is an integer less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

Since `k` is an integer, the expression `2 * k - 1` will also be an integer.

Therefore, the output will be an odd integer, specifically the value of `2 * k - 1`, where `k` is an integer less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is an integer less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2)**
