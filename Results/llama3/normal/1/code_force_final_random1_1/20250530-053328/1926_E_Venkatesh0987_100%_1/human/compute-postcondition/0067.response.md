The code prints the value of the expression `2 * k - 1`, where `k` is an integer less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `2 * k - 1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `2 * k - 1`, which is an odd number (since `k` is an integer and `2 * k - 1` is always odd).

Output: **an odd number (2 * k - 1) where k is an integer less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2**
