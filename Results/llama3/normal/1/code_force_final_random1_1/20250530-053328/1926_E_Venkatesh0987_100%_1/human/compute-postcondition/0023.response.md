Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, s is an integer, i is an integer, d is an integer, h is an integer, p is an integer, g is an integer, _ is an integer, stdin is empty. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than or equal to 1, d is greater than or equal to 0, h is 0, p is equal to i, g is equal to the sum of the integer division of (n + 1) by 2, repeated i - 1 times, _ is 0, f is equal to k minus g, and y is equal to 2 to the power of i minus 1, times 2 times f minus 1, and y is printed. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value of 2 * k - 1 is being printed.***
