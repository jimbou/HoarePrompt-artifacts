Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    i = 0
    d = n
    h = n
    p = 1
    g = 0
    if k > (n + 1) // 2:
        while s < k and d > 0:
            s += (d + 1) // 2
            d -= (d + 1) // 2
            i += 1
        while p <= i - 1:
            g += (h + 1) // 2
            h -= (h + 1) // 2
            p += 1
        f = k - g
        y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
        print(y)
    else:
        print(2 * k - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, k is an integer, s is an integer, i is an integer, d is an integer, h is an integer, p is an integer, g is an integer, _ is an integer, stdin is empty. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than or equal to 1, d is greater than or equal to 0, h is 0, p is equal to i, g is equal to the sum of the integer division of (n + 1) by 2, repeated i - 1 times, _ is 0, f is equal to k minus g, and y is equal to 2 to the power of i minus 1, times 2 times f minus 1, and y is printed. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and the value of 2 * k - 1 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, k is an integer, s is either 0 or n, i is an integer, d is either 0 or n, h is either 0 or n, p is either 1 or i, g is either 0 or the sum of the series (n + 1) // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + ... + 0 // 2, _ is an integer incremented by either 1 or the number of iterations of the loop, and either the value 2 is printed and f is k - g, or the value 2 * k - 1 is printed, depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, k is an integer, s is an integer, i is an integer, d is an integer, h is an integer, p is an integer, g is an integer, _ is an integer incremented by either 1 or i, and either the value 2 is printed and f is k - g, or the value 2 * k - 1 is printed, depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not. If k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, then n is greater than 0, k is greater than 0, s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than or equal to 1, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, and y is 2. If k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then n is an integer, k is an integer, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, and the value 2 * k - 1 is printed, where k is an integer and the value of 2 * k - 1 is an odd number less than or equal to n.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
