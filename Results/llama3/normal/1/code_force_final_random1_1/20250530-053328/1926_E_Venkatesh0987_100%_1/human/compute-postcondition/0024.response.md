To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the `range` object generated by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is an integer
* `k` is an integer
* `s` is an integer
* `i` is an integer
* `d` is an integer
* `h` is an integer
* `p` is an integer
* `g` is an integer
* `_` is an integer
* `stdin` is empty

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the condition for the loop to execute again. The loop will execute as long as the `range` object generated by `int(input())` has not been exhausted.

Since `_` is the loop variable, its value will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. The `range` object will be decremented by 1, meaning that the number of remaining iterations will decrease by 1.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`) are not affected by the loop head and will retain their current values.

The state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is an integer, `i` is an integer, `d` is an integer, `h` is an integer, `p` is an integer, `g` is an integer, `_` is an integer incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty**

Note that we cannot provide a specific value for `_` since it depends on the initial value of `int(input())`.
