Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, s is either 0 or n, i is an integer, d is either 0 or n, h is either 0 or n, p is either 1 or i, g is either 0 or the sum of the series (n + 1) // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + ... + 0 // 2, _ is an integer incremented by either 1 or the number of iterations of the loop, and either the value 2 is printed and f is k - g, or the value 2 * k - 1 is printed, depending on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 or not.***
