According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 3 and `i` must be greater than 2. `i` being greater than 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` must be greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is `n`, `i` must be greater than 3, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is 3, `g` is (`n` + 1) // 2 + 1 // 2, `_` is an integer incremented by the number of iterations of the loop**
