According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is at most `i`, and `i` is greater than 1. `p` being at most `i` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `p` is less than `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `s` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is greater than 1, `d` is greater than or equal to 0, `h` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, `p` is less than `i`, `g` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
