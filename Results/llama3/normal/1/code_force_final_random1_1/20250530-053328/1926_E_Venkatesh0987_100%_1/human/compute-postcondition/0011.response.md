The code block modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by the integer division of `h + 1` by 2. Since `h` is equal to `n`, which is greater than 0, `h + 1` is greater than 1, and the integer division of `h + 1` by 2 is at least 1. Therefore, `g` becomes at least 1.

The second line decrements `h` by the integer division of `h + 1` by 2. As explained earlier, this value is at least 1, so `h` becomes less than or equal to `n - 1`.

The third line increments `p` by 1. Since `p` is less than `i`, which is greater than 1, `p` becomes at most `i`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, k is an integer, s is greater than or equal to k, i is greater than 1, d is greater than or equal to 0, h is less than or equal to n - 1, p is at most i, g is at least 1, _ is 0, stdin is empty**
