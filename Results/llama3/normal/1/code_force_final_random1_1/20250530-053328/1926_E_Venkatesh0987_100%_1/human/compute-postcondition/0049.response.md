To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `s < k and d > 0`.

1. For `s < k`, since `s` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0 to satisfy this condition.
2. For `d > 0`, since `d` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0 to satisfy this condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` and `n`. The other variables in the program state do not affect the execution of the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `_` is an integer incremented by 1, and either the value 2 is printed and `f` is `k` - `g`, or the value 2 * `k` - 1 is printed, depending on whether `k` is greater than (`n` + 1) // 2 or not.**
