This function takes a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of three integers between 0 and 30, and returns a list of results. For each test case, it calculates the total points and checks if it's an even number. If it's not, it appends -1 to the results list. If it is, it calculates the total matches and checks if it's within a valid range. If it's not, it appends -1 to the results list. If it is, it calculates the number of equalities and checks if it's non-negative. If it's not, it appends -1 to the results list. If it is, it appends the number of equalities divided by 2 to the results list. The function returns the list of results, where each result is either -1 or a non-negative integer.
