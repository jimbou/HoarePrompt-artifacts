Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, `resultats` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p1, p2, p3 in cas_de_test:
    total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
    if total_points % 2 != 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    total_matchs = total_points // 2
    if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
    if egalites < 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
    else:
        resultats.append(egalites // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first sublist in the list, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is lower than 0, then `resultats` is a list containing -1, -1 and -1. Otherwise, if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, then `resultats` is a list containing -1 and -1. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing -1 and `egalites // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, and the list must have at least 2 sublists, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the second sublist in the list, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3 // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing -1, -1, -1, -1 if `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd, otherwise if `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is lower than 0, then `resultats` is a list containing -1, -1 and -1, otherwise if `(p1 + p2 + p3 // 2)` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `(p1 + p2 + p3 // 2)`, then `resultats` is a list containing -1 and -1, otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing -1 and `(p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)) // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, then `resultats` has an additional -1 appended to it. If `egalites` is less than 0, then `resultats` has an additional -1 appended to it. Otherwise, `resultats` has an additional element `egalites // 2` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, and the list must have at least 3 sublists, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the third sublist in the list, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1, -1, -1, -1` if `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd, otherwise if `p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` is lower than 0, then `resultats` is a list containing `-1, -1 and -1`, otherwise if `(p1 + p2 + p3 // 2)` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `(p1 + p2 + p3 // 2)`, then `resultats` is a list containing `-1 and -1`, otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing `-1 and (p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)) // 2`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, then `resultats` has an additional `-1` appended to it. If `egalites` is less than 0, then `resultats` has an additional `-1` appended to it. Otherwise, `resultats` has an additional element `egalites // 2` appended to it. If `total_points` is odd, then `resultats` has an additional `-1` appended to it. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, then `resultats` has an additional `-1` appended to it. Otherwise, `resultats` has the same elements as before, and an additional element `egalites // 2` is appended to it. If `egalites` is less than 0, then `resultats` has an additional `-1` appended to it. Otherwise, `resultats` has the same elements as before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
