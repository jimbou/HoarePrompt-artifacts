Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, p1, p2, p3 are the first sublist in the list, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to total_points // 2, resultats is a list containing -1 and -1.**

The code appends -1 to the resultats list, which already contains -1. The continue statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. The values of t, cas_de_test, p1, p2, p3, total_points, and total_matchs remain unchanged.
