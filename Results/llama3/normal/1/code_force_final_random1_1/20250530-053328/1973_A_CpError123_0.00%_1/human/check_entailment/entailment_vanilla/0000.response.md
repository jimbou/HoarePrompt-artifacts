Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends, given their final scores. The program iterates through each test case, calculates the total points, total matches, and then determines the maximum number of draws that could have occurred.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program first checks if the total points are odd. If they are, it immediately returns -1, as the total points must be even (each game results in either 2 points for a win, 0 points for a loss, or 1 point for a draw).
2.  Next, it calculates the total number of matches by dividing the total points by 2. If the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if the highest score (p3) is greater than the total number of matches, it returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario.
3.  Then, it calculates the maximum number of draws (egalites) by subtracting twice the difference between the highest score (p3) and the other two scores (p2 and p1) from the total points. This is because the difference between the highest score and the other two scores represents the number of wins, and each win is worth 2 points.
4.  If the calculated number of draws is negative, it returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario. Otherwise, it returns the number of draws divided by 2, as each draw is worth 1 point.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends, given their final scores.

Correctness: **True**
