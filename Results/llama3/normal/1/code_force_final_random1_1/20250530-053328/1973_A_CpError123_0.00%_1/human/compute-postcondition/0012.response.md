Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first sublist in the list, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `egalites` is lower than 0, `resultats` is a list containing -1 and -1 and another -1.**

In this output state, all the variables keep their initial values except for `resultats` which has an additional -1 appended to it. The value of `egalites` is still lower than 0.
