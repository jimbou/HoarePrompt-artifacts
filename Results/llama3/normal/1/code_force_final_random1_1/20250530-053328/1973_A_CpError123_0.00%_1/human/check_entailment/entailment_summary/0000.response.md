Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program checks for the validity of the input scores and calculates the total points, total matches, and equalities accordingly. It handles the cases where the total points are odd, the total matches are invalid, or the equalities are negative, and returns -1 in such cases. Otherwise, it returns the maximum possible number of draws. The program's logic is sound, and it produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
