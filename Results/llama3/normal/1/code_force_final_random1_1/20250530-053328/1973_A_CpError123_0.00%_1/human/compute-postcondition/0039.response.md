Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are undefined, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, `egalites` are undefined, `resultats` is a list containing either -1 or `egalites // 2` for each sublist in the initial `cas_de_test` list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `cas_de_test` is empty, and the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, and `egalites` are undefined because they are no longer needed. The list `resultats` contains the results of the calculations for each sublist in the initial `cas_de_test` list. If the total points for a sublist are odd, or if the total matches are greater than 3, or if the third point is greater than the total matches, then the corresponding element in `resultats` is -1. Otherwise, the element in `resultats` is the number of equalities calculated for that sublist.
