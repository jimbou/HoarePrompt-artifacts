Postcondition: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, and the list must have at least 3 sublists, p1, p2, p3 are the third sublist in the list, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to p1 + p2 + p3 // 2, egalites is equal to total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1), resultats is a list containing -1, -1, -1, -1 if p1 + p2 + p3 is odd, otherwise if p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1) is lower than 0, then resultats is a list containing -1, -1 and -1, otherwise if (p1 + p2 + p3 // 2) is greater than 3 or p3 is greater than (p1 + p2 + p3 // 2), then resultats is a list containing -1 and -1, otherwise, resultats is a list containing -1 and (p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)) // 2. If total_matchs is greater than 3 or p3 is greater than total_matchs, then resultats has an additional -1 appended to it. If egalites is less than 0, then resultats has an additional -1 appended to it. Otherwise, resultats has an additional element egalites // 2 appended to it. If total_points is odd, then resultats has an additional -1 appended to it.**
