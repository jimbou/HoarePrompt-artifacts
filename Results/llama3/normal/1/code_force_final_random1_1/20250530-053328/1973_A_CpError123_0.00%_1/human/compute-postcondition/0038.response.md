Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the last sublist in the list, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing the results of the calculations for each sublist in `cas_de_test`. If `total_points` is odd, then the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, then the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`. If `egalites` is less than 0, then the corresponding element in `resultats` is `-1`. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `resultats` is `egalites // 2`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains a positive integer, `cas_de_test` becomes an empty list because all its sublists have been processed, and `resultats` contains the results of the calculations for each sublist in `cas_de_test`. The results are either `-1` if the total points are odd, the total matches are more than 3, or the number of equalities is negative, or the number of equalities divided by 2 if none of these conditions are met.
