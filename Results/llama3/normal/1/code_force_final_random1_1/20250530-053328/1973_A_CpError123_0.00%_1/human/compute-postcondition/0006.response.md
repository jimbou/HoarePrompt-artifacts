Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, p1, p2, p3 are the first sublist in the list, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to total_points // 2, If the total_points is an odd number, then resultats is a list containing -1. Otherwise, resultats is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is: t is still a positive integer, cas_de_test is still a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, and the list must have at least 1 sublist. p1, p2, p3 are still the first sublist in the list. total_points is still equal to p1 + p2 + p3. total_matchs is now equal to half of total_points. If the total_points is an odd number, then resultats is still a list containing -1. Otherwise, resultats is still an empty list.
