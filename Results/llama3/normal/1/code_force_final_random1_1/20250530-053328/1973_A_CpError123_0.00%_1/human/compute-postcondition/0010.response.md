Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first sublist in the list, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, then `resultats` is a list containing -1 and -1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `egalites` is calculated based on the values of `total_points`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `cas_de_test` and the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, and `total_matchs` are still the same. The value of `egalites` is now a specific integer value calculated from the other variables. If the conditions for `total_matchs` and `p3` are met, the value of `resultats` is still a list containing -1 and -1.
