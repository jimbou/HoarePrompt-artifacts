According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cas_de_test`. If the list has at least 1 sublist the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer, `resultats` is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 sublist and the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first sublist in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, `resultats` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first sublist in the list**
