Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, `resultats` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `cas_de_test` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code initializes a new variable `resultats` and assigns it an empty list.
