Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first sublist in the list, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing -1 and -1 if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, otherwise `resultats` is a list containing -1 and `egalites // 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `egalites` is appended to the `resultats` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The `resultats` list now contains two elements: -1 and the integer division of `egalites` by 2. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and relationships.
