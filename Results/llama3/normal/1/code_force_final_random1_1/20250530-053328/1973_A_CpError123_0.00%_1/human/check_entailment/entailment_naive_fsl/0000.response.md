Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program iterates over each test case, calculates the total points, and checks if the total points are even. If the total points are not even, it appends -1 to the result list, as it is not possible to achieve the given scores with an odd total number of points.

The program then calculates the total number of matches and checks if it is within the valid range (not more than 3). If the total number of matches is not within the valid range or if the maximum score (p3) is greater than the total number of matches, it appends -1 to the result list, as it is not possible to achieve the given scores.

Finally, the program calculates the number of draws by subtracting the difference between the maximum score and the other two scores from the total points. If the calculated number of draws is negative, it appends -1 to the result list. Otherwise, it appends the calculated number of draws divided by 2 to the result list.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and test cases provided in the problem description. It also correctly handles cases where the input scores are not achievable with any valid set of games and results.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the Correctness is **True**.
