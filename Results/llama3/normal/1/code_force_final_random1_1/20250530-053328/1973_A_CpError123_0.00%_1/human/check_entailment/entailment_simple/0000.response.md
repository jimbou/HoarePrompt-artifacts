Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends, given their final scores. The program iterates over each test case, calculates the total points, total matches, and draws, and appends the result to the `resultats` list.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

1.  If the total points are odd, it immediately appends -1 to the `resultats` list, as this is an invalid scenario.
2.  If the total matches are more than 3 or the highest score is more than the total matches, it appends -1 to the `resultats` list, as this is also an invalid scenario.
3.  If the calculated draws (`egalites`) are negative, it appends -1 to the `resultats` list, as this is another invalid scenario.
4.  Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible draws by dividing `egalites` by 2 and appends the result to the `resultats` list.

The program correctly returns a list of results, where each result is either -1 (indicating an invalid scenario) or the maximum possible draws.

Correctness: **True**
