Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, and the list must have at least 1 sublist, resultats is a list containing -1, p1, p2, p3 are the first sublist in the list, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3 and the current value of total_points is an odd number.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `resultats.append(-1)` and `continue`. The first line appends the value -1 to the `resultats` list, which was initially empty. The second line, `continue`, does not affect any variables or the state of the program in this context, as it is typically used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move on to the next iteration, but there is no loop in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the only change in the state is that `resultats` now contains the value -1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
