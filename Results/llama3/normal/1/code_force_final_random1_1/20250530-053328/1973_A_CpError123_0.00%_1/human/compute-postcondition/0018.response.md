Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers each, each integer is between 0 and 30 inclusive, and the three integers in each sublist are non-decreasing, and the list must have at least 2 sublists, p1, p2, p3 are the second sublist in the list, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to total_points // 2, egalites is equal to total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1), resultats is a list containing -1, -1, -1, -1.**

The code appends -1 to the resultats list and then skips the rest of the code in the current iteration using the continue statement. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged, except for the resultats list, which now contains an additional -1.
