Output State: **The program returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains either -1 or the value of `egalites // 2`, and `egalites` is an undefined variable.**

Note: Since `egalites` is undefined, its value is unknown, and therefore the value of `egalites // 2` is also unknown. The program returns a list of sublists with either -1 or an unknown value.
