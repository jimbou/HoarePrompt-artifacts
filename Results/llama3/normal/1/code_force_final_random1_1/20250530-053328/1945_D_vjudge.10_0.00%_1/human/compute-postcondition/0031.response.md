Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 1`. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `stdin`, `a`, and `b` as in the initial state. The variable `y` will be equal to `max_p - 1`. The variable `custo` will be the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`.
