Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and the first, second and third element of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the third element of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `b_values` has been updated to include the integer value of `y`, which is the third element of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
