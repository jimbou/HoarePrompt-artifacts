Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p` by at least 2, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 2`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]`.***
