Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and the first and second element of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element of `b`.**

In this output state, the only change is that `b_values` now includes the second element of `b` converted to an integer, in addition to the first element that was already converted. All other variables remain unchanged.
