Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer greater than 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 1`. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer greater than 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 1`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1` plus `b_values[max_p - 1]`. If `y` is 1, then `custo` is also increased by `a_values[0]`. Otherwise, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, plus `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]`, and `a_values[y - 1]` plus `b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 2`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 2` plus `b_values[max_p - 2]`. If `y` is 1, then `custo` is also increased by `a_values[0]`. Otherwise, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 2`, plus `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]`, and `a_values[y - 1]` plus `b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 3`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values` at index `y` which is `max_p - 3`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values` at index `y` which is `max_p - 3` plus the value of `a_values` at index 0. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values` at index `y` which is `max_p - 3`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is incremented by the value of `a_values` at index `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
