Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, and `i` is the length of `b`.

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all elements in list `b`, converting each string element to an integer and appending it to `b_values`. The loop has iterated over all elements in `b`, leaving `b` as an empty list and `y` as the last element of the original `b`. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
    if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
        custo += a_values[y]
    else:
        custo += b_values[y]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 1`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is `custo + a_values[num_fila - 1]` and `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo + a_values[num_fila - 1]`. Otherwise, `custo` is greater than or equal to the value of `b_values[y]` and `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p` by at least 2, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 2`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p` by at least 2, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 3`. If the integer value of the element at index `y` in `a_values` is less than the integer value of the element at index `y` in `b_values`, then `custo` is increased by the integer value of the element at index `y` in `a_values`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
