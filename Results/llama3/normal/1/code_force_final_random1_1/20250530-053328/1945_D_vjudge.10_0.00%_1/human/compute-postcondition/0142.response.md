Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is equal to `max_p - 1`, `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, otherwise `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]`, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is characterized by the following changes:

*   `y` is equal to `max_p - 1`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements of `b`.
*   `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, otherwise `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]`, indicating that the loop has updated the value of `custo` based on the comparison between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]`.
*   `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, indicating that the loop has updated the list of previous values of `custo`.

All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
