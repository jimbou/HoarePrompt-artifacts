Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is equal to the value of `a_values[y]`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `custo` has been updated to be equal to the value of `a_values[y]`, which is a specific value from the list of strings from the second line of stdin converted to integers. All other variables remain unchanged.
