To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `y` is greater than 0, and `y` will decrease by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `y` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

The only other variable in the loop head is `max_p`, but its value does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 1, `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.**
