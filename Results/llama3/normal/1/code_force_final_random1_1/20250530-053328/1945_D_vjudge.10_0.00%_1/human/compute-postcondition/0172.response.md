Based on the precondition, the print statement will output the second element in the `custos` list, which contains the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`. Since `custos` must have at least 2 elements, the second element `c` is a valid index.

The value of `c` is the second element in the `custos` list, which is the previous value of `custo` before the last update. The last update of `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila` - 1 to 0, plus `a_values[0]`.

Since `b_values` is an empty list, the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` are all 0, except for the first element `a_values[0]`. Therefore, the last update of `custo` is `a_values[0]`.

The previous value of `custo` before the last update is not explicitly defined in the precondition. However, since `custos` must have at least 2 elements, we can assume that the previous value of `custo` is a valid integer value.

Output: **the previous value of custo (which is the second element in the custos list)**
