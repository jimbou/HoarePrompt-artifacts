Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and the first element of `b` converted to an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `y` is the first element of `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still greater than 0, the list `custos` is still empty, the value of `i` is still 0, the value of `custo` is still 0, the value of `num_fila` is still the first integer from the first line of stdin, the value of `max_p` is still the second integer from the first line of stdin, the list `a_values` still contains strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, the list `b_values` now contains strings from the third line of stdin and the first element of `b` converted to an integer, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three lines, the list `a` is still empty, the list `b` still contains at least one string, and the value of `y` is still the first element of `b`.
