Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 1. If the sum of the integer value of the first element of `a_values` and the integer value of the first element of `b_values` is less than or equal to the integer value of the second element of `a_values`, then `custo` is increased by the integer value of the first element of `a_values`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]`.***
