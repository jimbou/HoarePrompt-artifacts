To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `num_fila - 2`. To execute the loop again, `y` must be decremented by 1, so `y` becomes `num_fila - 3`.

The state of `num_fila` and `max_p` remains the same, as they are not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p` by at least 2, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 3**
