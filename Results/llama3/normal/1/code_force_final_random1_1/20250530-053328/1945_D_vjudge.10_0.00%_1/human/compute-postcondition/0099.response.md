Output State: **x is an integer greater than 1, num_fila is an integer greater than max_p, max_p is an integer greater than 1, a_values is a list containing the integer values of all elements of a, b_values is a list containing the integer value of all elements of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines, a is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, b is an empty list, y is 2, custo is increased by the integer value of the first element of a_values.**

In this output state, the value of `custo` has been updated by adding the integer value of the first element of `a_values` to its original value. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties as specified in the initial state.
