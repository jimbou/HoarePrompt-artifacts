Output State: **x is an integer greater than 0, num_fila is an integer greater than or equal to max_p, max_p is an integer greater than 1, a_values is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in a converted to integers, b_values is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of b converted to integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines, a is an empty list, b is an empty list, y is max_p - 3, custo is incremented by the value of a_values at index y.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `custo`, which is incremented by the value of `a_values` at index `y`. The value of `y` is `max_p - 3`, and since `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is also an integer. The list `a_values` contains strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, so the value at index `y` is an integer. Therefore, `custo` is incremented by an integer value.
