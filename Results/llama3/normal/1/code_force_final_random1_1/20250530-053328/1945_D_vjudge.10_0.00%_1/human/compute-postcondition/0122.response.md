To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `b`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `b`. If the list `b` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` has at least 1 element, `y` is the first element of `b`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must have at least 2 elements, and `y` must be the second element of `b`.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element of `b`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.**
