Output State: `x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, and `i` is equal to the length of `b`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is a state where all elements of list `b` have been processed and their integer values have been appended to `b_values`. The list `b` is now empty, and the variable `y` holds the last element of `b` (which is also the last element that was processed). The variable `i` has been incremented to the length of `b`, indicating that all elements of `b` have been processed. All other variables remain unchanged.
