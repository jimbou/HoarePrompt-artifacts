Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `y` is the first element of `a`, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, and `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the only change is that `a_values` now contains the integer value of the first element of `a`, which is `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
