Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer equal to the initial value of x, num_fila is an integer greater than or equal to max_p, max_p is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a_values is a list containing the integer values of all elements of a, b_values is a list containing the integer values of all elements of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3x lines, a is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, b is an empty list, y is 0, custo is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to 0, plus a_values[0], and custos is a list containing the updated value of custo and the previous values of custo.
Code of the loop:
for c in custos:
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer equal to the initial value of `x`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3x lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of `stdin`, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila` - 1 to 0, plus `a_values[0]`, `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo` that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element in `custos`, and the first element in `custos` which is `c` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is an integer equal to the initial value of `x`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3x lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of `stdin`, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila` - 1 to 0, plus `a_values[0]`, `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo` that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is the second element in `custos`, and the second element in `custos` which is `c` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is an integer equal to the initial value of `x`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3x lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of `stdin`, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila` - 1 to 0, plus `a_values[0]`, `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo` that must have at least 3 elements, `c` is the third element in `custos`, and the third element in `custos` which is `c` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
