To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `max_p`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `max_p` is greater than 1 and `y` is within the range from `max_p - 1` down to 1.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `max_p - 1` to `num_fila - 1`, and `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`**
