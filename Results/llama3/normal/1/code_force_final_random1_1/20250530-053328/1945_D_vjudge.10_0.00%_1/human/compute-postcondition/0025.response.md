Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is a list containing the value of `b_values[y]`, `i` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 2**

The code adds the value of `b_values[y]` to the `custos` list. Since `y` is equal to `num_fila - 2`, the value added to `custos` is the second last element of `b_values`. The other variables remain unchanged.
