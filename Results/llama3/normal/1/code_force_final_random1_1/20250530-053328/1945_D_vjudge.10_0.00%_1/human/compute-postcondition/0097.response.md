The only variable in the loop head is variable  y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be greater than 0. Since the loop iterates in reverse order (from `max_p - 1` to `0`), `y` must be 2 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 2**
