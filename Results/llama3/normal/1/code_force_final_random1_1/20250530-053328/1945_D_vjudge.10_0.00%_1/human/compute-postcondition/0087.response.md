Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 1`. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `max_p - 1` to `num_fila - 1`, and `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all elements in the range from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, comparing corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` and adding the minimum value to `custo`. The loop has iterated over all elements in the specified range, leaving `y` as `max_p - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
