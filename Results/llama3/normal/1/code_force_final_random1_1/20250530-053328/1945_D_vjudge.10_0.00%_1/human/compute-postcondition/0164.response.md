Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 1, `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custo` is updated to its previous value plus `a_values[0]` if `y` is 1, otherwise no change. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
