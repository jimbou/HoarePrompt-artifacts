Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is a list containing one element which is the integer value of the string at index `num_fila - 2` in `a_values`, `i` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `custos` has been updated to include the integer value of the string at index `num_fila - 2` in `a_values`. All other variables remain unchanged.
