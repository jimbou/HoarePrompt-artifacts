Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first m people in a queue of n people. The program iterates over each test case, reads the input values, and calculates the minimum cost by comparing the values of a_i and b_i for each position.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost. It first calculates the cost from the end of the queue to the maximum allowable final position (max_p) by comparing a_i and b_i for each position. Then, it calculates the cost from max_p to the beginning of the queue by comparing a_i and b_i for each position and adding the minimum cost to the total cost.

The program also correctly handles the edge case where Kirill needs to pay a_i coins to the person at position 0.

The program's output is also correct, as it prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
