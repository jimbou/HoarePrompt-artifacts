Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first three elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the second element of `b`, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, and `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `b_values` has been updated to include the integer value of the second element of `b`, which is `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
