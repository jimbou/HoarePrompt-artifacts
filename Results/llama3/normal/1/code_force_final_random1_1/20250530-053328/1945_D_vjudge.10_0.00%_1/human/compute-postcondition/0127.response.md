Output State: `x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is characterized by the following changes:

*   `b_values` now contains the integer values of all elements of `b`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements of `b`.
*   `b` is now an empty list, indicating that the loop has exhausted all elements of `b`.
*   `y` is the last element of `b`, which is now empty, indicating that the loop has reached the end of `b`.

All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
