Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 2, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[2]`, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.**

In this output state, the value of `custo` has been increased by the value of `b_values[2]`, which is the third element of the list `b_values`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three lines.
