Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 1, `custo` is increased by the integer value of the second element of `b`**

In this output state, the value of `custo` has been updated by adding the integer value of the second element of `b` (since `y` is 1). The other variables remain unchanged. Note that since `b` is an empty list, the second element of `b` is not defined, so the value of `custo` is increased by an undefined value.
