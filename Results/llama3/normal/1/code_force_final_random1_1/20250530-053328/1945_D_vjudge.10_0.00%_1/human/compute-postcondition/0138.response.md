To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.


The loop head is `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is within the range of `num_fila - 2` to `max_p - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order.


The state of `num_fila` and `max_p` remains unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop.


Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:


State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is within the range of `num_fila - 3` to `max_p - 1`, `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, otherwise `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]`, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines. Additionally, for all indices `y` within the range of `num_fila - 3` to `max_p - 1`, the value of `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to the value of `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is not less than `b_values[y]`.**
