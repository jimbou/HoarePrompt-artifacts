Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 1, `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` which is the previous value of `custo` plus a_values[0] if y is 1, otherwise no change, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.***
