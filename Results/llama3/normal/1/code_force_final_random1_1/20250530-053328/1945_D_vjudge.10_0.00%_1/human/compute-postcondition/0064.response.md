Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `y` is the last element of `a`, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, and `i` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `a_values` will contain the integer values of all elements in the list `a`, and `y` will be the last element of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
