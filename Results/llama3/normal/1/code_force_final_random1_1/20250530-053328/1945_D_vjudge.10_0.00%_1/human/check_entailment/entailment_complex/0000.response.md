Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for Kirill to bribe people in a queue to reach a position among the first m people. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the number of people in the queue (n) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m), followed by two lists of integers representing the costs of bribing each person (a_i and b_i).

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case by iterating over the lists of integers in reverse order, comparing corresponding elements, and summing the minimum values. It also handles the special case where Kirill needs to bribe the person at position 1.

The program then prints the calculated minimum costs for each test case.

Based on the provided execution states, the program correctly handles the input data and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
