To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `a` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, and `y` is the second element of `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `y` must be the third element of `a`.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `a`, the integer value of the second element of `a`, and the integer value of the third element of `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `y` is the third element of `a`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`.**
