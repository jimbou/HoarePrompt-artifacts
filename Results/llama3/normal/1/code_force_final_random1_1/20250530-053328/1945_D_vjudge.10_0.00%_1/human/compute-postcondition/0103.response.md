To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):`.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `y`. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `y` is greater than 0. Since `y` is currently 2, we need to decrement it by 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, such as `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `stdin`, `a`, `b`, and `custo`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 1**
