Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to 0, plus `a_values[0]`, and `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, and a new list `custos` is created, containing the value of `custo`, which is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to 0, plus `a_values[0]`.
