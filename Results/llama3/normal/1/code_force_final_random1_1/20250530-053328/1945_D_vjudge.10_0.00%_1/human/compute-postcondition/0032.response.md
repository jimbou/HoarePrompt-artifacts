To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `max_p`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `max_p` is greater than 1, since the loop starts from `max_p - 1` and goes down to 1. The initial value of `y` should be `max_p - 1` for the loop to start.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`**
