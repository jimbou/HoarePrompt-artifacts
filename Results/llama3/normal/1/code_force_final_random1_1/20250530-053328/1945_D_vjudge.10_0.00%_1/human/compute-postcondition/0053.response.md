Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0. `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to 0, plus `a_values[0]`.**

The loop will execute until `y` is 0. At this point, `custo` will be the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to 0, plus `a_values[0]`. This is because the loop will continue to increment `custo` by the minimum value between `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` until `y` is 0. When `y` is 0, the loop will exit and `custo` will be the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to 0, plus `a_values[0]`.
