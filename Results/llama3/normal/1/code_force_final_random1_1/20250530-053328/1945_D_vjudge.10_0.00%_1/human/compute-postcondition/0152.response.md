The only variable in the loop head is variable  y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `y` must be 2.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 2, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]` if `y` is `max_p - 1` and the sum of `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, otherwise `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[0]` plus `b_values[0]` if `y` is 1, or `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]` if `y` is `max_p - 1` and the sum of `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.**
