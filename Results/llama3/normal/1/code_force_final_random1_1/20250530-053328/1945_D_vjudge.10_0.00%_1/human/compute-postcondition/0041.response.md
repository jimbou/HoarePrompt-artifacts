State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 2`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 2` plus `b_values[max_p - 2]`. If `y` is 1, then `custo` is also increased by `a_values[0]`. Otherwise, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 2`, plus `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]`, and `a_values[y - 1]` plus `b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`.**
