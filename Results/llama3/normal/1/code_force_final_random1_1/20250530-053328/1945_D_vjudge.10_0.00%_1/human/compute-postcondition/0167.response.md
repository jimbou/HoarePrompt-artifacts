Output State: **x is an integer equal to the initial value of x, num_fila is an integer greater than or equal to max_p, max_p is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a_values is a list containing the integer values of all elements of a, b_values is a list containing the integer values of all elements of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3x lines, a is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, b is an empty list, y is 0, custo is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to 0, plus a_values[0], and custos is a list containing the updated value of custo and the previous values of custo.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that the value of x is equal to the initial value of x, and the value of custos is a list containing the updated value of custo and the previous values of custo for all iterations of the loop.
