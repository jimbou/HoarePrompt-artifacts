Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, printing all elements in the `custos` list. The loop variable `c` is the last element in `custos`, and this last element has been printed. All other variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and each element in the `custos` list has been printed. The loop variable `c` now holds the last element of `custos`, which has been printed as well. The values of all other variables, such as `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `stdin`, `a`, `b`, `y`, and `custo`, remain unchanged since they are not affected by the loop.
