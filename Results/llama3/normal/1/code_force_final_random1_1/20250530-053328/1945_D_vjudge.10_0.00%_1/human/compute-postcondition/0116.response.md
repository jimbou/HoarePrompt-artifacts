The code appends the integer value of `y` to the list `a_values`. Since `y` is the second element of `a`, which is a list of strings, we need to convert it to an integer using `int(y)`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `a` and the integer value of the second element of `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `y` is the second element of `a`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`.**
