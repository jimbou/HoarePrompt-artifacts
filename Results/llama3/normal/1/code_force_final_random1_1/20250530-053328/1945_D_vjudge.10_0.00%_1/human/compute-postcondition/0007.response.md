The only variable in the loop head is variable  y and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, y is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and y is the third element in the list.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and the first two elements in `a` converted to integers and the second element in `a` converted to integer, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the third element in `a`**
