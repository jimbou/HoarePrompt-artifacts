The only object in the loop head is variable  y and list b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list b.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, b has at least 2 elements, y is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the y is the third element in the list.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `b`, the integer value of the second element of `b` and the integer value of the third element of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the third element of `b`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.**
