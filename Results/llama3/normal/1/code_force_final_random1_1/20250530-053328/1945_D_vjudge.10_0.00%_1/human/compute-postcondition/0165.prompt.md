Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is equal to `max_p - 1`, `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, otherwise `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]`, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is either 1 or `max_p - 1`, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]` if `y` is `max_p - 1` and the sum of `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, otherwise `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[0]` plus `b_values[0]` if `y` is 1, or `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]` if `y` is `max_p - 1` and the sum of `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 2, `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[2]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[0]` plus `b_values[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 1, `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custo` is updated to its previous value plus `a_values[0]` if `y` is 1, otherwise no change. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
