Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 1`, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, and `i` is the length of `b`. The value of `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to the value of `b_values[y]`***
