To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(x):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is not explicitly mentioned in the given state, but we can infer its value based on the loop condition. Since `i` is not explicitly mentioned, we will focus on `x`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is greater than the current value of `i` (which is not explicitly mentioned), the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `x` must still be greater than the current value of `i`. Since `i` is not explicitly mentioned, we can assume that `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than the current value of `i`, which is now `i + 1`.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `max_p - 1` to `num_fila - 1` plus the value of `a_values[0]`, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`.**
