To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for y in b:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `b` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, and `y` is the first element of `b`. For the loop to execute again, `b` must have at least 2 elements, and `y` should be the second element of `b`.

The other variables mentioned in the state (`x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `a`, `stdin`, `custo`, `custos`, and `i`) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first two elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element of `b`, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, and `i` is 1**
