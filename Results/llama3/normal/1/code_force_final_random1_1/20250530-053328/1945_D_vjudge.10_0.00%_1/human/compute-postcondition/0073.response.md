The only variables in the loop head are variables  y, num_fila and max_p, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num_fila` and `max_p`. If num_fila is greater than max_p, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, and `i` is the length of `b` does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `num_fila` is greater than `max_p` and y is now `num_fila - 1`.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 1`, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, and `i` is the length of `b`**
