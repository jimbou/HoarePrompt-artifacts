Output State: **x is an integer greater than 0, custos is an empty list, i is 0, custo is 0, num_fila is the first integer from the first line of stdin, max_p is the second integer from the first line of stdin, a_values is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, b_values is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.**

The code initializes several variables to 0, including `custo`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`. It also initializes two empty lists, `a_values` and `b_values`. The code then reads three lines from stdin: the first line is split into two integers, `num_fila` and `max_p`, which are assigned to the corresponding variables. The second and third lines are split into lists of strings, `a_values` and `b_values`, respectively. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0, and the list `custos` remains empty. The variable `x` is not modified by the code and remains an integer greater than 0. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus the three lines that were read.
