To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `y` and the list `b`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `b`. If the list `b` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `y` is the loop variable, it will take on the value of the first element of `b` at the start of the loop.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin that must have at least 1 element, `y` is the first element of `b`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`.**
