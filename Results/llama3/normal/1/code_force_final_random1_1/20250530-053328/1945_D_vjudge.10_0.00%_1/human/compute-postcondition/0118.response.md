Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `a`, the integer value of the second element of `a`, the integer value of the third element of `a`, and the integer value of the third element of `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `y` is the third element of `a`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `a_values` now contains an additional element, which is the integer value of the third element of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
