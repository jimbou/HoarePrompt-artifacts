To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `max_p`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `y` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `max_p - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be decreased by 1, so `y` becomes `max_p - 3`.

The state of `max_p` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, such as `x`, `num_fila`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `stdin`, `a`, `b`, and `custo`, are not modified in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 3**
