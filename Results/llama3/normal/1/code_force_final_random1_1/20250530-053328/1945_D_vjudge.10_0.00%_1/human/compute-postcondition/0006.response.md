Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and the first two elements in `a` converted to integers and the second element in `a` converted to integer, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element in `a`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains an integer greater than 0. The list `custos` is still empty. The value of `i` is still 0. The value of `custo` is still 0. The value of `num_fila` is still the first integer from the first line of stdin. The value of `max_p` is still the second integer from the first line of stdin. The list `a_values` now includes the second element of `a` converted to an integer, in addition to the strings from the second line of stdin and the first two elements in `a` converted to integers. The list `b_values` remains unchanged, containing strings from the third line of stdin. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three lines. The list `a` still has at least 2 elements. The value of `y` is still the second element in `a`.
