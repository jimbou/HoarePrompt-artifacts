Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is within the range of `num_fila - 3` to `max_p - 1`, `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]`, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.**

In this output state, the value of `custo` has been updated by adding the value of `a_values[y]` to it, because for all indices `y` within the range of `num_fila - 3` to `max_p - 1`, the value of `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to the value of `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is not less than `b_values[y]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
