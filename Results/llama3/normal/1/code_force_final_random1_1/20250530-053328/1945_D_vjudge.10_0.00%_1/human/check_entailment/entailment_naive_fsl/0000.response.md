Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5

The program will output 14, but the correct output should be 13. The program is not considering the case where Kirill can exchange places with the person at position 1 and then move to position 2, which would cost 7 + 3 + 3 = 13 coins.

The program is also not considering the case where Kirill can exchange places with the person at position 2 and then move to position 1, which would cost 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 coins.

The program is only considering the case where Kirill exchanges places with the person at position 3 and then moves to position 2, which costs 14 coins.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all cases and the Correctness is **False**.
