Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `b`, the integer value of the second element of `b`, the integer value of the third element of `b` and the integer value of the third element of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the third element of `b`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.**

In this output state, the value of `b_values` has been updated to include the integer value of the third element of `b`, which is also the value of `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
