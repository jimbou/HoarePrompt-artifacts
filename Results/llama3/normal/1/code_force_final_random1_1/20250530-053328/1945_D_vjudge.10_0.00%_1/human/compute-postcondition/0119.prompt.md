Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer greater than i + 1, num_fila is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, max_p is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, a_values is an empty list, b_values is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines, a is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, b is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, y is 0, custo is 0, and custos is a list containing the updated value of custo and the previous values of custo.
Code of the loop:
for y in a:
    a_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `y` is the first element of `a`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `a` and the integer value of the second element of `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `y` is the second element of `a`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `a`, the integer value of the second element of `a`, the integer value of the third element of `a`, and the integer value of the third element of `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `y` is the third element of `a`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
