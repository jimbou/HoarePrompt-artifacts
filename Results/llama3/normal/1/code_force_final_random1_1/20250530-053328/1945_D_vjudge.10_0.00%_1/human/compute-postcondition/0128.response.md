To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`. The loop will execute as long as `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`. Before the loop starts, `y` is the last element of `b`, which is an empty list, so `y` needs to be adjusted to be within the range of `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is within the range of `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.**
