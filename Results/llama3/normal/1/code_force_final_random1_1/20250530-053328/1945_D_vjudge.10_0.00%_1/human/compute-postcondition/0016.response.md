Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that all variables not affected by the loop remain unchanged. The loop iterates over the list `b`, converting each element to an integer and appending it to `b_values`. After the loop finishes, `b_values` will contain all elements of `b` converted to integers, and `b` will be empty since it has been fully iterated over. The variable `y` is no longer defined as it was only defined within the scope of the loop.
