Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first four elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin that must have at least 4 elements, `y` is the third element of `b`, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, and `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `b_values` has been updated to include the integer value of the third element of `b`, which is `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three lines, and the lists `a` and `b` still contain the same strings as before. The values of `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `custo`, and `custos` are also unchanged.
