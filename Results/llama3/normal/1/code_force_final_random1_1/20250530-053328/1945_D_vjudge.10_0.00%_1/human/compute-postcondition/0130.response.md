Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is within the range of `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, `custo` is equal to the previous value of `custo` plus the current value of `a_values[y]`, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `custo` has been updated by adding the current value of `a_values[y]` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `custos` has also been updated to include the new value of `custo`. The rest of the variables and stdin remain the same as in the initial state.
