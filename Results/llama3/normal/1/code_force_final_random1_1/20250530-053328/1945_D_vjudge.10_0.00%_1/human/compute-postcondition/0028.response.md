Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `custo` is increased by the integer value of `a_values[num_fila - 3]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `stdin`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `y` is still `num_fila - 3`. The value of `custo` is increased by the integer value of the element at index `num_fila - 3` in the list `a_values`.
