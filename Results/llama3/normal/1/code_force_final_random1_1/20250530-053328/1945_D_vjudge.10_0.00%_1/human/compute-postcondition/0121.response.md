Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin that must have at least 1 element, `y` is the first element of `b`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is still greater than `i` + 1. The values of `num_fila` and `max_p` are still the same as the first and second integers from the first line of stdin, respectively. The list `a_values` still contains the integer values of all elements of `a`. The list `b_values` now contains the integer value of the first element of `b`. The lists `a` and `b` still contain the same strings from the second and third lines of stdin, respectively. The value of `y` is still the first element of `b`. The value of `custo` is still 0, and the list `custos` still contains the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three lines.
