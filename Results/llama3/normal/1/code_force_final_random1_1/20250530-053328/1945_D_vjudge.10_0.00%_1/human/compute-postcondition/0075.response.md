The code `custo += a_values[y]` increments the value of `custo` by the value of `a_values[y]`. Since `y` is equal to `num_fila - 1`, we can substitute this value into the expression. Additionally, we know that `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, but we don't know the exact value of `a_values[y]`. However, we can express the new value of `custo` in terms of its previous value and `a_values[y]`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 1`, `custo` is `custo + a_values[num_fila - 1]`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo + a_values[num_fila - 1]`, and `i` is the length of `b`.**
