To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `y` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` must have at least 1 element, `y` is the first element in `a`**
