Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]` for all `y` from `max_p - 1` to 1, otherwise `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]`, `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `custos` now contains the updated value of `custo` and all its previous values.
