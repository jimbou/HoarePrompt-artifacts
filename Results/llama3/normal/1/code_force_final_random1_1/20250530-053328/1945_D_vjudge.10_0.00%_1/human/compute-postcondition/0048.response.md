Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 3, custo` is increased by the value of `b_values` at index `y` which is `max_p - 3`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `stdin`, `a`, and `b` remains the same. The value of `y` is still `max_p - 3`. The value of `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values` at index `y` which is `max_p - 3`.
