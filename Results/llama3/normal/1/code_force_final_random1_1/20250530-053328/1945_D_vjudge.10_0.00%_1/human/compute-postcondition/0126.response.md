Output State: `x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.

The loop iterates over each element in list `b`, converting each string to an integer and appending it to list `b_values`. After the loop finishes executing, `b_values` will contain the integer values of all elements in `b`, and `b` will be empty since all its elements have been processed. The other variables remain unchanged.
