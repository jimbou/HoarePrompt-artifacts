To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate as long as `y` is within the range from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1` (inclusive) and decrements by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `y` is `num_fila - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be decremented by 1, so `y` becomes `num_fila - 2`.

The other variables in the loop head are `num_fila` and `max_p`. Since `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, and `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, we can conclude that `num_fila` must be greater than `max_p` by at least 2.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `y` is `num_fila - 2`
* `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p` by at least 2

The other variables (`x`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `stdin`, `a`, `b`, and `custos`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p` by at least 2, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 2**
