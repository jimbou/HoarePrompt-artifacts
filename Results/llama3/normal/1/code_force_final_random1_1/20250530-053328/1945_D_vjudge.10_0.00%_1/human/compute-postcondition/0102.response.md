Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 2. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by the integer value of the first element of `a_values` if `y` is equal to 1. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by the integer value of `a[y]`.***
