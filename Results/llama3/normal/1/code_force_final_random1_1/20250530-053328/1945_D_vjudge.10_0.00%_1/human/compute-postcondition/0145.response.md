Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin and must be at least 2, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]`, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines. The current value of `a_values[y - 1]` plus `b_values[y]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a_values[y]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `custo` has been increased by the value of `b_values[y]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is still greater than `max_p`, and `max_p` is still equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin and at least 2. The lists `a_values` and `b_values` still contain the integer values of all elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The list `a` still contains strings from the second line of stdin, and the list `b` is still empty. The value of `y` is still `max_p - 1`. The list `custos` now contains the updated value of `custo` and all previous values of `custo`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three lines. The relationship between `a_values[y - 1]`, `b_values[y]`, and `a_values[y]` remains the same.
