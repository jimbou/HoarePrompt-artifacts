Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `max_p - 1` to `num_fila - 1` plus the value of `b_values[y]`. If `y` is equal to 1, `custo` is updated by adding the value of `a_values[0]` and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo`.***
