Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 1`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is `custo + a_values[num_fila - 1]` and `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo + a_values[num_fila - 1]`. Otherwise, `custo` is greater than or equal to the value of `b_values[y]` and `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`.***
