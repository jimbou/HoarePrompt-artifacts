The only object in the loop head is variable  c and list  custos, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the custos.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, custos has at least 1 element, c is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the c is the second element in the list.
State: **`x` is an integer equal to the initial value of `x`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3x lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of `stdin`, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila` - 1 to 0, plus `a_values[0]`, `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo` that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is the second element in `custos`**
