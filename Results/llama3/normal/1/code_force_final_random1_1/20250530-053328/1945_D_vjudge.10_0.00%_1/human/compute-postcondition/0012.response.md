The only object in the loop head is variable  y and list b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list b.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, b is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, y is the first element of b. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the y is the second element of b.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and the first element of `b` converted to an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element of `b`.**
