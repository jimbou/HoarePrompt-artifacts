Output State: **x is an integer greater than 0, num_fila is an integer greater than or equal to max_p, max_p is an integer greater than 1, a_values is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in a converted to integers, b_values is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of b converted to integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines, a is an empty list, b is an empty list, y is max_p - 1, custo is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in a_values and b_values from index num_fila - 1 to max_p - 1, plus a_values[y - 1] and b_values[y], and a_values[y - 1] plus b_values[y] is greater than a_values[y].**

The code snippet increments the value of `custo` by `a_values[y]`, where `y` is `max_p - 1`. This means that the new value of `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, plus `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]`. The condition that the sum of `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]` remains valid. All other variables remain unchanged.
