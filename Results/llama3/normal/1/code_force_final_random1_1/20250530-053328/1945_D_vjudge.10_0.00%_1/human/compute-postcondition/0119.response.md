Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `y` is the last element of `a`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `a_values` will contain the integer values of all elements in list `a`, and `y` will be the last element of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
