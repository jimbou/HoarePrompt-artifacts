Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and the first element in `a` converted to an integer, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` must have at least 1 element, `y` is the first element in `a`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` remains an integer greater than 0. The list `custos` is still empty. The variable `i` is still 0. The variable `custo` is still 0. The values of `num_fila` and `max_p` remain the same as they were in the initial state. The list `a_values` now contains the original strings from the second line of stdin plus the first element of `a` converted to an integer. The list `b_values` remains unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three lines. The list `a` still has at least one element. The value of `y` is still the first element in `a`.
