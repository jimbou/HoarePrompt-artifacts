To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):`.

1. `y` is the loop variable, and its value is decremented by 1 in each iteration because the range is defined with a step of `-1`. So, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be decremented by 1 from its current value, which is `num_fila - 2`. Therefore, `y` should be `num_fila - 3`.

2. `num_fila` and `max_p` are not modified within the loop, so their values remain the same.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 3**
