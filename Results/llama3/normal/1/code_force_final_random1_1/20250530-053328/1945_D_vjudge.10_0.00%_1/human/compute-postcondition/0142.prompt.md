Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer equal to the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`, `custo` is 0, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is characterized by the following changes:

*   `b_values` now contains the integer values of all elements of `b`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements of `b`.
*   `b` is now an empty list, indicating that the loop has exhausted all elements of `b`.
*   `y` is the last element of `b`, which is now empty, indicating that the loop has reached the end of `b`.

All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
    if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
        custo += a_values[y]
    else:
        custo += b_values[y]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is within the range of `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, otherwise `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]`, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines. Additionally, for all indices `y` within the range of `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1`, the value of `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to the value of `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is not less than `b_values[y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is within the range of `num_fila - 2` to `max_p - 1`, `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, otherwise `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]`, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines. Additionally, for all indices `y` within the range of `num_fila - 2` to `max_p - 1`, the value of `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to the value of `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y]` is not less than `b_values[y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is within the range of `num_fila - 3` to `max_p - 1`, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines. For all indices `y` within the range of `num_fila - 3` to `max_p - 1`, if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]`, otherwise `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
