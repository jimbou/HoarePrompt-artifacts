Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 1`, `custo` is greater than or equal to the value of `b_values[y]`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, and `i` is the length of `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `stdin`, `a`, `b`, `y`, `custos`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the value of `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]`, which is greater than or equal to the value of `b_values[y]`.
