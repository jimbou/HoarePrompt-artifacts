To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(x):`, which means the only variable that can be adjusted is `i` and `x`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not explicitly stated, but we can infer that it is equal to the number of iterations that have already occurred. Since `x` is an integer greater than 0, we can assume that `i` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` must be greater than the new value of `i`. Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila - 1` to 0, plus `a_values[0]`, and `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, `i` is 1**
