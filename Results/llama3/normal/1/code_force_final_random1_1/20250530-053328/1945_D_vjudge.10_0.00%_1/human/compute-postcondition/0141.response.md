Postcondition: **`x` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer equal to the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is within the range of `num_fila - 3` to `max_p - 1`, and `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three lines. For all indices `y` within the range of `num_fila - 3` to `max_p - 1`, if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]`, otherwise `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]`.**
