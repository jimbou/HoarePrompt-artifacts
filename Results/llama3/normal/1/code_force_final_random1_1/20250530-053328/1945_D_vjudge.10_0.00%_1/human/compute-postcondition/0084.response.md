Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p` by at least 2, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 3, `custo` is increased by the integer value of the element at index `y` in `a_values`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `x`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `stdin`, `a`, `b` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `y` is still `num_fila - 3`. The value of `custo` is increased by the integer value of the element at index `y` in `a_values`.
