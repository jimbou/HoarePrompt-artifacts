To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `b`. Since `b` is currently a list of strings (`b_values`), and the loop iterates over `b`, we need to ensure that `b` has at least one element for the loop to execute. Additionally, `y` is not defined before the loop, so we need to define it as an element of `b`.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `y` is the first element of `b`**
