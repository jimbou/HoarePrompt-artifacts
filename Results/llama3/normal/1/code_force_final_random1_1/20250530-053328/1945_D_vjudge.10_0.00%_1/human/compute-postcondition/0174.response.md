To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for c in custos:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `c` and `custos`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is the second element in `custos`, which is being printed. To execute the loop again, `custos` must have at least 3 elements, and `c` must be the third element in `custos`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`x` is an integer equal to the initial value of `x`, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3x lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of `stdin`, `b` is an empty list, `y` is 0, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila` - 1 to 0, plus `a_values[0]`, `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo` that must have at least 3 elements, `c` is the third element in `custos`**
