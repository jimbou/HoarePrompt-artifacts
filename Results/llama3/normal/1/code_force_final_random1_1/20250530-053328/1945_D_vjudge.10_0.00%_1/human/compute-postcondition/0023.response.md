To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p`. At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is `num_fila - 1`. To execute the loop again, `y` must be decremented by 1, so `y` becomes `num_fila - 2`.

The state of `num_fila` and `max_p` remains the same, as they are not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `num_fila` is an integer greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` is an integer, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin and all elements of `b` converted to integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 2**
