Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `custo` is 0, `num_fila` is the first integer from the first line of stdin, `max_p` is the second integer from the first line of stdin, `a_values` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin and all elements in `a` converted to integers, `b_values` is a list of strings from the third line of stdin, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is an empty list, `y` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all elements in list `a` have been converted to integers and appended to `a_values`. The loop has finished executing, so `a` is now an empty list and `y` is no longer defined. The other variables remain unchanged.
