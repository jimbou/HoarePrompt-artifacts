Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `num_fila` is an integer greater than `max_p` by at least 2, `max_p` is an integer greater than 1, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements of `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of all elements of `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three lines, `a` is a list of strings from the second line of stdin, `b` is an empty list, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values` at index `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `custo` has been updated by adding the value of `b_values` at index `y`, which is `num_fila - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
