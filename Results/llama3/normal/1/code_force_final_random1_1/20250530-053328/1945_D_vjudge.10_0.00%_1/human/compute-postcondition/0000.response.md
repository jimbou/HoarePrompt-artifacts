Output State: **x is an integer, custos is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200000). The second line contains n integers (1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9).**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines, `x` will be the first integer of the first test case. The second line initializes an empty list `custos`. No other variables are affected.
