Based on the initial state, the print statement will output the third element in the `custos` list, which is `c`.

Since `custos` is a list containing the updated value of `custo` and the previous values of `custo` that must have at least 3 elements, the third element `c` is the value of `custo` from the previous iteration.

The value of `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` from index `num_fila` - 1 to 0, plus `a_values[0]`. However, since `b` is an empty list, the minimum values between corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` are all 0, and the sum is just `a_values[0]`.

Therefore, the value of `c` is the value of `a_values[0]` from the previous iteration.

Output: **a_values[0] (where a_values[0] is the first element of the list a_values)**
