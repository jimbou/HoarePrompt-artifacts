Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, j is equal to the length of lis. If test is True, 'Alice' is printed if the length of lis is odd, otherwise 'Bob' is printed. If test is False, no printing occurs.***
