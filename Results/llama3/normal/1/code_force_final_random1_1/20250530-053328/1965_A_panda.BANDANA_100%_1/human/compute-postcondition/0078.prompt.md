Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, `test` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, 'Alice' or 'Bob' may have been printed depending on the values of test and lis.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
        if j % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        test = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, test is False if the difference between the second element of lis and the first element of lis is greater than 1, otherwise test remains True. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, 'Alice' or 'Bob' may have been printed depending on the values of test and lis.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, j is 2. If the difference between the third element of lis and the second element of lis is greater than 1, then test is False and 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, test remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input that must have at least 4 elements, j is 3. If the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of lis is greater than 1, then test is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
