Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input that must have at least len(lis) elements, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the difference between two consecutive elements in lis is not greater than 1, then 'Alice' is printed if the length of lis is odd, and 'Bob' is printed if the length of lis is even. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
