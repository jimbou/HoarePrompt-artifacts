Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, test is unchanged**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` is updated to the input value, replacing its initial value. The second line reads a list of integers from the input, splits them into individual integers using the `split()` function, and maps each integer to an integer using the `map()` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `l`. The third line sorts the list of integers in `l` in ascending order using the `sorted()` function and removes any duplicates using the `set()` function. The resulting sorted list of unique integers is assigned to the variable `lis`.

The initial state of the variables is as follows:

* `t` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5
* `i` is 2
* `n` is an integer equal to the input value
* `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input
* `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two
* `test` is unchanged

After the code executes, the final state of the variables is as follows:

* `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 2*10^5
* `i` remains unchanged, still 2
* `n` is updated to the input value
* `lis` is updated to a sorted list of unique integers from the input
* `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, since two inputs have been read
* `test` remains unchanged

Note that the variable `l` is not included in the output state since it is not mentioned in the initial state.
