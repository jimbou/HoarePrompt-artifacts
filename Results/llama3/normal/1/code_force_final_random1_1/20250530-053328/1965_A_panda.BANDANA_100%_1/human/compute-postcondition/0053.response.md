Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, 'Alice' or 'Bob' may have been printed depending on the values of test and lis. The current value of `j` is 1 and the difference between the second element of `lis` and the first element of `lis` is greater than 1. The current value of `j` is odd***
