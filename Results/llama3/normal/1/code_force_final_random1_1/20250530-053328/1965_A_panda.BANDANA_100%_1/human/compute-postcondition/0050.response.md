Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, `test` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, 'Alice' or 'Bob' may have been printed depending on the values of test and lis.**

In this output state, the value of `test` has been updated to True, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two, and 'Alice' or 'Bob' may have been printed depending on the previous values of `test` and `lis`.
