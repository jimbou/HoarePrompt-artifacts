Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, j is 1. If lis[j] - lis[j - 1] is greater than 1, test is set to False and either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether j is odd or even respectively. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
