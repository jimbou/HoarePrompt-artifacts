To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, we can conclude that `t` is indeed at least 1.

However, to make the loop execute, we also need to adjust the state of `i`. Since the loop iterates over the range of `t`, we can set `i` to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n**
