Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `j` is 3, `test` is False. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1]` is greater than 1, then the program state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.***
