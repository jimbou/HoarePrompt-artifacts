Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers, 1 is in `lis` and the length of `lis` is more than 1, `test` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
        if j % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        test = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, j is 1. If lis[j] - lis[j - 1] is greater than 1, test is set to False and either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether j is odd or even respectively. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, j is 2. If the difference between the second and first elements of lis is greater than 1, test is False and either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether j is odd or even. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `j` is 3, `test` is False. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1]` is greater than 1, then the program state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
