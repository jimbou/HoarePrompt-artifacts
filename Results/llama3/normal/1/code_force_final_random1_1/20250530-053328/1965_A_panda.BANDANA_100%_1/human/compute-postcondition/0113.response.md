The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and lis, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and lis. If j is less than len(lis), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 2, lis has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1 so j is 3 and for the loop to execute again lis must have at least 4 elements.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input that must have at least 4 elements, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the difference between two consecutive elements in lis is greater than 1, test is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
