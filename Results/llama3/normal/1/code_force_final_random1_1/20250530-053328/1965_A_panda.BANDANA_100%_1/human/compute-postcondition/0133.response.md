Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It processes each test case by removing duplicates, sorting the numbers, and then determining the winner of a game based on the sequence of numbers. If the sequence starts with 1 and all consecutive numbers are either the same or differ by 1, the winner is determined by the length of the sequence (Alice wins if the length is odd, Bob wins if it's even). Otherwise, the winner is determined by the first pair of consecutive numbers that differ by more than 1 (Bob wins if the first number of the pair is odd, Alice wins if it's even). The function prints the winner's name for each test case.**
