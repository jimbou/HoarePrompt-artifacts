Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the optimal moves of both players. The program first checks if there is a pile with only one stone, in which case Alice can win by removing that stone. If not, it checks if all piles have the same number of stones, in which case Alice can win by removing all stones at once. If neither of these conditions is met, the program checks the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes. If any difference is greater than 1, the program determines the winner based on the parity of the index of the larger pile size. If no such difference is found, the program determines the winner based on the parity of the number of unique pile sizes.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and determines the winner according to the game logic. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
