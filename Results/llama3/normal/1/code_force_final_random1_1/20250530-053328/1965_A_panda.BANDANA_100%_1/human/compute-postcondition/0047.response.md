Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, test is unchanged, 'Alice' or 'Bob' may have been printed depending on the values of test and lis.**

Explanation:
The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by one. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin, maps them to integers, and assigns the result to l. The third line sorts the unique elements of l and assigns the result to lis. The values of t, i, and test are not affected by the code. The printing of 'Alice' or 'Bob' depends on the values of test and lis, which are not specified in the initial state.
