The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The number of test cases is given on the first line of stdin.

After executing the code, the value of `t` is the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5. The stdin now contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.**
