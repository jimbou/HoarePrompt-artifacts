To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `lis`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `lis` has at least 2 elements. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `lis` to have at least 2 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `j` is 1**
