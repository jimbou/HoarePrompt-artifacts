Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, test is False if the difference between any two consecutive elements in lis is greater than 1, otherwise test remains True. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, 'Alice' or 'Bob' may have been printed depending on the values of test and lis.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains within the range of 1 to 2*10^5, `i` remains 1, `n` remains equal to the input value, and `lis` remains a sorted list of unique integers from the input. The variable `test` will be set to False if there is a gap of more than 1 between any two consecutive elements in `lis`, otherwise it remains True. Additionally, either 'Alice' or 'Bob' may have been printed to the console depending on the values of `test` and `lis`, and the standard input contains multiple test cases minus two.
