The only object in the loop head is variable j and lis, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lis. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, lis has at least 2 elements, j is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the j is 2.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, j is 2**
