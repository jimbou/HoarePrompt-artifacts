Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, test is False, j is 2, 'Alice' is printed.**

The first line of the code sets the value of `test` to `False`. The second line, `break`, is not applicable in this context as it is typically used within loops to terminate the loop's execution. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not affect the state of any variables.

Given that `j` is 2, which is an even number, 'Alice' is printed according to the initial state conditions. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `lis` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.
