Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code reads an integer n from the input, which represents the number of elements in the list. It then reads n integers from the input and stores them in the variable l. The set function is used to remove duplicates from the list, and the sorted function is used to sort the unique elements in ascending order. The sorted list of unique integers is stored in the variable lis. The variable t and i remain unchanged. Stdin now contains one less test case.
