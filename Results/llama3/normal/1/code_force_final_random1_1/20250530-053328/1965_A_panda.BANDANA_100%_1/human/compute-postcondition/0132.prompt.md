Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = map(int, input().split())
    lis = sorted(set(l))
    if 1 not in lis or len(lis) == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        test = True
        for j in range(1, len(lis)):
            if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
                if j % 2 == 1:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Alice')
                test = False
                break
        if test == True:
            if len(lis) % 2 == 1:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If 1 is not in lis or lis has only one element, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if test is True, 'Alice' is printed if the length of lis is odd, otherwise 'Bob' is printed. If test is False, no printing occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, test is unchanged. If 1 is not in lis or lis contains only one element, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if the difference between any two consecutive elements in lis is not greater than 1, either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on whether the length of lis is odd or even. Otherwise, no output is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, test is unchanged. If 1 is not in lis or the length of lis is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If 1 is in lis and the length of lis is greater than 1, then if the difference between two consecutive elements in lis is not greater than 1, 'Alice' is printed if the length of lis is odd, and 'Bob' is printed if the length of lis is even. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
