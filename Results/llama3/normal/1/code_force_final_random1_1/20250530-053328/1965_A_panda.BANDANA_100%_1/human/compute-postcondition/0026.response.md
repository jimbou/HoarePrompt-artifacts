Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, j is 2. If the difference between the second and first elements of lis is greater than 1, test is False and either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether j is odd or even. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
