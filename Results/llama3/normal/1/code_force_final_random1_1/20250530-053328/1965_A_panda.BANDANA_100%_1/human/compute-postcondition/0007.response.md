Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers, 1 is in `lis` and the length of `lis` is more than 1, `test` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code assigns the value `True` to the variable `test`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
