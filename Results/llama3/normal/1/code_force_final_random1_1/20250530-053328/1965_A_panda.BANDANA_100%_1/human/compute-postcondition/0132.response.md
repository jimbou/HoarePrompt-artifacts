Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 2*10^5, i is equal to t, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, stdin contains no test cases, test is unchanged. If 1 is not in lis or the length of lis is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If 1 is in lis and the length of lis is greater than 1, then if the difference between two consecutive elements in lis is not greater than 1, 'Alice' is printed if the length of lis is odd, and 'Bob' is printed if the length of lis is even. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing all the test cases in the input. The variable `t` is now equal to the number of test cases, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is the number of integers in the last test case, `lis` is the sorted list of unique integers from the last test case, and `stdin` contains no more test cases. The output is either 'Alice' or 'Bob' depending on the conditions in the loop, or no output if the conditions are not met.
