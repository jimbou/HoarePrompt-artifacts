Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is True, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `j` is 1. The current value of `lis[j] - lis[j - 1]` is greater than 1. If `j` is an odd number, 'Bob' is being printed. If `j` is an even number, 'Alice' is being printed.***
