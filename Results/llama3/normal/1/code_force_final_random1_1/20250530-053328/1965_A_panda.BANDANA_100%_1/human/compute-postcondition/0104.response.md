Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the difference between the second element of lis and the first element of lis is greater than 1, then test is False and either 'Bob' is printed if j is an odd number or 'Alice' is printed if j is an even number. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
