Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, test is unchanged. If 1 is not in lis or the length of lis is 1, 'Alice' is printed. If 1 is in lis and the length of lis is greater than 1, then if the difference between two consecutive elements in lis is not greater than 1, 'Alice' is printed if the length of lis is odd, and 'Bob' is printed if the length of lis is even. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
