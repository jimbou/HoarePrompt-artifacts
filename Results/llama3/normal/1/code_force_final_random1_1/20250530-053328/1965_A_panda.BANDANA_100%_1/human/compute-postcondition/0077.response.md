Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, lis is a sorted list of unique integers from the input that must have at least 4 elements, j is 3. If the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of lis is greater than 1, then test is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
