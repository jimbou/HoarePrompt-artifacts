Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, j is equal to the length of lis, test is False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `i` remains 0, `n` remains an integer, `lis` remains a sorted list of unique integers, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. The variable `j` is now equal to the length of `lis`, and `test` is set to False.
