Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `t` and `v` are assigned the two integers from the input, stdin contains no input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is set to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing `v`; otherwise, `num` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `t` and `v` are updated to the two integers from the input. The conditions for `start`, `end`, and `num` are still valid, but their values may have changed based on the new values of `t` and `v`.
