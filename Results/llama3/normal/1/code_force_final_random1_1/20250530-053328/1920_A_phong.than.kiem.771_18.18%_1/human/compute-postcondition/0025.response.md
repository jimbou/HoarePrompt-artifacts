Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is set to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing `v`; otherwise, `num` is an empty list.***
