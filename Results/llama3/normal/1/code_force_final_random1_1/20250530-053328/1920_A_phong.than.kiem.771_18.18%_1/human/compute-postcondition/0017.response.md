Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is a list containing `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `end`, `num`, and `i` are the same as in the initial state. The code has introduced two new variables, `t` and `v`, which are integers. The value of `t` and `v` are obtained from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. The stdin is now empty, as the input has been consumed.
