Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the last element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive). stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` will be the last element of the list `num`, and the variable `count_num` will be the total number of elements in `num` that fall within the range defined by `start` and `end` (inclusive). The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged, and there is no input in stdin.
