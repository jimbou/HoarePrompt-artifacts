Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where Alex has n constraints on what the integer k can be. There are three types of constraints: k must be greater than or equal to some integer x, k must be less than or equal to some integer x, and k must be not equal to some integer x. The program needs to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints.

The program consists of multiple functions, but the main logic is in function 7 (func_7). This function reads the number of constraints (n) and then processes each constraint. It maintains a start and end value for the range of possible k values and a list of values that k cannot be equal to. After processing all constraints, it calculates the number of integers within the range that are not present in the list of excluded values.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It handles all three types of constraints, updates the start and end values of the range accordingly, and counts the number of excluded values within the range. The final result is the difference between the size of the range and the count of excluded values, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.

The other functions (func_1 to func_6) are not directly related to the main logic of solving the problem. They seem to be utility functions for reading input, processing strings, and searching arrays, but they are not used in the main function (func_7).

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
