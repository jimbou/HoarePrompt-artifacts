Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `num` is a list containing `v`. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`, then `start` is set to `v`. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `end` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to include `v`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for `start` and `end` are still applicable based on the values of `t` and `v`.
