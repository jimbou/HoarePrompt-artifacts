Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains n-1 inputs: n-1 lines, each containing two integers t and v.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 0. The variables `t` and `v` are assigned the values of the first line of input from stdin, which contains two integers. The stdin now contains n-1 lines of input, each containing two integers.
