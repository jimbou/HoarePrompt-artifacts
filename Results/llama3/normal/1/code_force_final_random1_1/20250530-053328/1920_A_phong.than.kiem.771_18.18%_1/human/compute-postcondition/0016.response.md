To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how the variables within it are updated.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. This means we are only concerned with the variables `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 0, we need to increment it by 1 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is a list containing `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` is an empty list, `i` is 1**

Note that we don't need to update `n` because it's not changed by the loop iteration. We only need to increment `i` by 1.
