Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the second element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3 and must have at least 2 elements, `count_num` is 0 if `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), otherwise `count_num` is 1, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration, but does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have skipped to the next iteration of the loop.
