To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `num`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `i` is used as the loop variable, it should be set to the first element of the list `num`. The other variables (`n`, `start`, `end`, `count_num`, and stdin) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the first element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3 and must have at least 1 element, `count_num` is 0, stdin contains no input**
