Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than or equal to 0.
*   The value of `i` is `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
*   The value of `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1. If no `t` is 1, `start` remains -1.
*   The value of `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2. If no `t` is 2, `end` remains 1000000000.0.
*   The value of `num` is a list containing all `v` encountered when `t` is 3. If no `t` is 3, `num` remains an empty list.
*   The stdin contains no input, indicating that all inputs have been processed.
