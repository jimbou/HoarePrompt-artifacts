Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3, `count_num` is 0, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in num:
    if i < start or i > end:
        continue
    else:
        count_num += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the first element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3 and must have at least 1 element, `count_num` is 0 if `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), otherwise `count_num` is 1. stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the second element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3 and must have at least 2 elements. If `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), `count_num` is 0 and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. If `i` is within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), `count_num` is 2. stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the third element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3 and must have at least 3 elements. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, `count_num` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
