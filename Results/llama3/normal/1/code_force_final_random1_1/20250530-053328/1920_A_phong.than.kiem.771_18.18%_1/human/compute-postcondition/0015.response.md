Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is a list containing `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0. If `t` is 2, then `end` is updated to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. If `t` was 1 before, `start` is updated to `v` if `start` was less than `v`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
