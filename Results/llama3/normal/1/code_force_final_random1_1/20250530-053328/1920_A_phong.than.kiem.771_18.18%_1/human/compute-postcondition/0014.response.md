Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is a list containing `v`, `i` is 0, `t` is 3.**

The code appends the value `v` to the list `num`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `v` is not specified, so it is included in the output state as is. The value of `t` is still 3, and the values of `n`, `end`, and `i` are still the same as in the initial state.
