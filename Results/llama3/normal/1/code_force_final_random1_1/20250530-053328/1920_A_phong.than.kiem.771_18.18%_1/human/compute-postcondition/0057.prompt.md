You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: first an integer n and then n lines, each containing two integers t and v, where t is an integer in {1,2,3} and v is an integer in [1, 10^9].
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3, stdin contains no input.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the last element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive). stdin contains no input.
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns the integer 0.
    #State: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the last element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), and `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the range of values from `start` to `end` (inclusive) and the number of elements in `num` that are within this range, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the integer 0.

Case_2: The program returns the difference between the range of values from `start` to `end` (inclusive) and the number of elements in `num` that are within this range, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
