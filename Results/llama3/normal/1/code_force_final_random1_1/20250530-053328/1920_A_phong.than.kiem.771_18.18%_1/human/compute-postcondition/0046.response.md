Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the second element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3 and must have at least 2 elements, `count_num` is 1 if `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), otherwise `count_num` is 2. stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count_num` is incremented by 1. If `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), `count_num` becomes 1, otherwise it becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
