Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`, then `start` is set to `v`. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `num`, `end` remain unchanged.***
