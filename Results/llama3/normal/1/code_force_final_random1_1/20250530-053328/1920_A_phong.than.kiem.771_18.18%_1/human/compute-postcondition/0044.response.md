The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list num, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list num.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, num has at least 1 element, i is the first element of num. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the i is the second element of num.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the second element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3 and must have at least 2 elements, `count_num` is 0 if `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), otherwise `count_num` is 1. stdin contains no input.**
