Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `end` is equal to `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`, then `start` is set to `v`. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `num` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `end` is updated to be equal to `v`. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, and `v` remain unchanged. The value of `start` is still dependent on the condition `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`, if this condition is true then `start` is set to `v`, otherwise it remains unchanged. The value of `num` also remains unchanged.
