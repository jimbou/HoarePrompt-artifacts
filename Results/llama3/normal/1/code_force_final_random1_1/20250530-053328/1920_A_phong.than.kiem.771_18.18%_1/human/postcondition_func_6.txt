This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and returns the number of integers within a certain range that are not present in a given list. The input consists of n+1 lines, where the first line contains an integer n, and the remaining lines contain two integers t and v. The function uses t to determine how to process v: if t is 1, it updates the start of the range; if t is 2, it updates the end of the range; and if t is 3, it adds v to the list. After processing all input, the function counts the number of elements in the list that fall within the range [start, end] and returns the difference between the size of the range and this count, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.
