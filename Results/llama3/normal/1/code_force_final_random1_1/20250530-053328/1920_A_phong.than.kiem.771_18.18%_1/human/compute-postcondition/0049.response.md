Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the third element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3 and must have at least 3 elements, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged.
