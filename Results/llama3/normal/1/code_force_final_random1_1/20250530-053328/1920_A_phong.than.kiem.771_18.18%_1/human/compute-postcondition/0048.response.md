The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and num, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the num.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, num has at least 2 elements, i is the second element of num. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element of num.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the third element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3 and must have at least 3 elements**
