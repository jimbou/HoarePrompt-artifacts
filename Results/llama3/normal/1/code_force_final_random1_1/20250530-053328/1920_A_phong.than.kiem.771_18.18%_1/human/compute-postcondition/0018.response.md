Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is a list containing `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is `v`, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `start` is now equal to `v`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `num` still contains `v` if `t` is 3, and is empty otherwise. The input buffer is still empty.
