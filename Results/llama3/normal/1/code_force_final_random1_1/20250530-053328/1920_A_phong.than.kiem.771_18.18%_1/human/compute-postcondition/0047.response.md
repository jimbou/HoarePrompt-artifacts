Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the second element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3 and must have at least 2 elements. If `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), `count_num` is 0 and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. If `i` is within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), `count_num` is 2. stdin contains no input.**
