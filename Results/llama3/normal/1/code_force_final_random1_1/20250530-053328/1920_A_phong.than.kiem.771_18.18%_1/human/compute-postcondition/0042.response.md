Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the first element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3 and must have at least 1 element, `count_num` is 1, stdin contains no input. The first element of `num` is within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive).**

In this output state, the value of `count_num` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `count_num` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The first element of `num` is still within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), and stdin remains empty.
