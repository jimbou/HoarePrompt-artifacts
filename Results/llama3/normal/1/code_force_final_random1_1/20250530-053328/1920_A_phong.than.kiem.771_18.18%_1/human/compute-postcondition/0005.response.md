Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `start` is an integer and its current value is `v`, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer and its current value is 1, `v` is an integer and its current value is greater than `start`, stdin contains n-1 inputs: n-1 lines, each containing two integers t and v.**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `v`, which is an integer greater than the original value of `start` (-1). The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains n-1 inputs.
