Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value indicating whether to return 1 or to read an integer from the standard input.
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer read from the standard input.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1, which is the value to be returned when the boolean variable isOne is True.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function returns an integer value based on the input boolean variable 'isOne'. If 'isOne' is False, it reads an integer from the standard input and returns it. If 'isOne' is True, it returns the integer 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean value, to_int is a boolean value, and stdin contains one input: a string that can be either a space-separated list of integers or a string of characters.
    line = input()

If `space` is True, `items` is a list of strings split from `line` by spaces. If `space` is False, `items` is a list of characters.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers. If `space` is True, the list contains integers converted from the space-separated numbers in the string `line`. If `space` is False, the list contains integers converted from the individual characters in the string `line`.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of strings or characters. If `space` is True, the list contains strings split from `line` by spaces. If `space` is False, the list contains individual characters from `line`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a string input from stdin, splits it into items based on a boolean `space` parameter, and returns a list of either integers or strings/characters based on another boolean `to_int` parameter. If `space` is True, the input string is split by spaces; otherwise, it is split into individual characters. If `to_int` is True, the function converts the items to integers and returns the list; otherwise, it returns the list of strings or characters.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and sym is a string.

    return string
    #The program returns a string that is the concatenation of the string representation of each integer in the list `arr` followed by the string `sym`, repeated for each integer in the list `arr`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers and a string as input, and returns a new string that is the concatenation of the string representation of each integer in the list followed by the input string, repeated for each integer in the list. The original list and string inputs remain unchanged.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string and substring are strings.

    return indices
    #The program returns a list of indices containing all indices of all occurrences of substring in string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds and returns all occurrences of a given substring within a string, providing their indices in a list. It accepts a string and a substring as input, and returns a list of indices where the substring is found. If the substring is not found, an empty list is returned. The function does not modify the original string or substring.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of values and element is a value such that it exists in arr.
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where the value in the list 'arr' is equal to 'element'. The list 'arr' contains a list of values and 'element' is a value that exists in 'arr'.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of values 'arr' and a value 'element' as input, and returns a list of indices where 'element' is found in 'arr'. The function does not modify the original list 'arr' and returns an empty list if 'element' is not found in 'arr'.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a 2D list of lists, index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= index < len(arr[0]), and value is any type of value.
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: The program returns the subArray in the 2D list 'arr' where the value at the given index is equal to the given value. If no such subArray is found, the program does not return anything.
    return None
    #The program returns None, indicating that no subArray in the 2D list 'arr' was found where the value at the given index is equal to the given value.

#Overall this is what the function does:Searches a 2D list for a sub-array where the value at a specified index matches a given value, returning the first matching sub-array or None if no match is found.

#Function 7:

    #The program returns the difference between the range of values from `start` to `end` (inclusive) and the number of elements in `num` that are within this range, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and returns the number of integers within a certain range that are not present in a given list. The input consists of n+1 lines, where the first line contains an integer n, and the remaining lines contain two integers t and v. The function uses t to determine how to process v: if t is 1, it updates the start of the range; if t is 2, it updates the end of the range; and if t is 3, it adds v to the list. After processing all input, the function counts the number of elements in the list that fall within the range [start, end] and returns the difference between the size of the range and this count, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.
