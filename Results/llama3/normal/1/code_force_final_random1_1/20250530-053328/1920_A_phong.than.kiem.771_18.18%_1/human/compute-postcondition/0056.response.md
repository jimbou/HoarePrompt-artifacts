Output State: **The program returns the difference between the range of values from `start` to `end` (inclusive) and the number of elements in `num` that are within this range, but only if this difference is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0. Here, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive).**
