Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0. If `t` was previously 2, the current value of `end` is `v` if `v` was less than the previous value of `end`. If `t` was previously 1, the current value of `start` is `v` if `v` was greater than the previous value of `start`. Otherwise, no changes were made. The current value of `t` is 3.**
