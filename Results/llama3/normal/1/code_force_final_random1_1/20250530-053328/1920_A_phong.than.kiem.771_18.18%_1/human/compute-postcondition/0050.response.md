Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the third element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3 and must have at least 3 elements, `count_num` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `count_num` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `num` still contains at least 3 elements, and `i` is still the third element of `num`. The values of `start` and `end` are still determined by the maximum and minimum values of `v` when `t` is 1 and 2, respectively.
