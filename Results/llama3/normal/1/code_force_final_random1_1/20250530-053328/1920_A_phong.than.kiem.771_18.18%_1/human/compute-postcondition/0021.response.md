Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `end` is `v`, `num` is a list containing `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `end` has been updated to `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition "If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`" is still valid, but its effect on the state is not explicitly mentioned, as it depends on the values of `t` and `start`, which are not provided.
