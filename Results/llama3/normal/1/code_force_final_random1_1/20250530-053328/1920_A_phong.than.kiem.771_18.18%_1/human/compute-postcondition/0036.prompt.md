Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, start is -1, end is 1000000000.0, num is an empty list, stdin contains n inputs: n lines, each containing two integers t and v.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if t == 1:
        if start < v:
            start = v
    if t == 2:
        if end > v:
            end = v
    if t == 3:
        num.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is a list containing `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0. If `t` is 2, then `end` is updated to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. If `t` was 1 before, `start` is updated to `v` if `start` was less than `v`. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is set to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing `v`; otherwise, `num` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer. If `t` is 3, then `num` is a list containing `v`. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`. If `t` is 1 and `start` is less than `v`, then `start` is set to `v`. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `end` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
