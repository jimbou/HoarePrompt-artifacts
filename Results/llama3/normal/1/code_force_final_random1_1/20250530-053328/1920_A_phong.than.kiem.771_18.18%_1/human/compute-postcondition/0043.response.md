Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the first element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3 and must have at least 1 element, `count_num` is 0 if `i` is outside the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), otherwise `count_num` is 1. stdin contains no input.***
