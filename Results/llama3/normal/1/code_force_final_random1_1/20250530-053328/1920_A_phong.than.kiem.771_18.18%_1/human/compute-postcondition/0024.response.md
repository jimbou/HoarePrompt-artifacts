Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `num` is a list containing `v`, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains no input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is set to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`.**

The code appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Since `num` was initially either an empty list or a list containing `v` if `t` is 3, it will now always contain `v`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
