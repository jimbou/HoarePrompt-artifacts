The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since the current value of `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`, the `continue` statement will skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the first element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3 and must have at least 1 element, `count_num` is 0, stdin contains no input, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
