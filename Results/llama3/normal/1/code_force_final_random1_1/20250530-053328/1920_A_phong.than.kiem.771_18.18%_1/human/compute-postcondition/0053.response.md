Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the last element of `num`, `start` is the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, `end` is the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` when `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive). The current value of `start` is greater than the current value of `end`.**
