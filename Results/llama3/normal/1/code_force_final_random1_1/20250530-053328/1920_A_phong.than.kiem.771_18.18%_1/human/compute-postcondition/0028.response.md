Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is equal to `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been updated to be equal to `v`. The values of the other variables, `n`, `i`, `t`, and `v`, remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains no input.
