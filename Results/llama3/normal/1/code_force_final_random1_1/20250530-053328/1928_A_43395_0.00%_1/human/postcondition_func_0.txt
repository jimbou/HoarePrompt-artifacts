This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the size of a rectangle. It then determines whether the rectangle can be divided into two equal parts by a diagonal, and prints 'yes' if possible, 'no' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and leaves the input stream empty.
