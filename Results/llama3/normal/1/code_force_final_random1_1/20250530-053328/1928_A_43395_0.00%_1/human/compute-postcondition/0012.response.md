Output: **`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, and either `a` or `b` (or both) is odd. Additionally, it is not the case that ((a - b == -a and a) or (b - a == -b and b)). The current value of (a - b) is either greater than 0 or less than 0, and 'yes' is being printed**
