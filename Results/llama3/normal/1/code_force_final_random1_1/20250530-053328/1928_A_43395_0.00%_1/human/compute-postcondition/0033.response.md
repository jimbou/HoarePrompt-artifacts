Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the two integers input from the user, which are at least 2. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The stdin now contains one less test case, as one test case has been consumed by the input operation.
