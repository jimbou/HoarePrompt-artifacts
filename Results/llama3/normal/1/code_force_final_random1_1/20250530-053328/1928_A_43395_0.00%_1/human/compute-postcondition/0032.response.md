To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of the input value.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the input value.

Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.

The input value is not explicitly stated, but since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the input value must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

The states of `a` and `b` are not relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, input value is at least 2**
