Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, and either `a` or `b` (or both) is odd. If either `a` is equal to `-b` or `b` is equal to `-a`, 'no' is printed. Otherwise, if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'yes' is printed. If the difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'no' is printed.***
