Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The logic used in the program is flawed. The program checks if both a and b are even, and if so, it prints 'yes'. However, this is not a sufficient condition for the rectangle to be cut into two equal parts by a diagonal. The program also checks if the difference between a and b is equal to the negative of either a or b, and if so, it prints 'no'. This condition is also not correct.

The correct approach is to check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is greater than 1. If the GCD is greater than 1, it means that the rectangle can be cut into two equal parts by a diagonal, and the program should print 'yes'. Otherwise, it should print 'no'.

Correctness: **False**
