Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 3 3, the program prints 'no', but according to the problem description, it should print 'yes' because the 3x3 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles and then these two rectangles can be used to form the 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the 3x3 rectangle.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the difference between a and b is even or odd, but it does not consider the case where a and b are equal. In this case, the program incorrectly prints 'no'. 

A correct solution would be to check if a and b are equal, and if they are, print 'no'. Otherwise, print 'yes'. 

Here is a correct solution:

```
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == b:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')
```

This solution correctly handles all potential cases and prints the correct output according to the problem description.
