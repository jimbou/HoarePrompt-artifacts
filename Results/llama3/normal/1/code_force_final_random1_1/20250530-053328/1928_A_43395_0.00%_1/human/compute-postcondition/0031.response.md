Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If both `a` and `b` are even, 'yes' is printed. If either `a` is equal to `-b` or `b` is equal to `-a`, 'no' is printed. Otherwise, if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.***
