Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking various conditions based on the values of `a` and `b`. However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` is incorrect. This condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even, but it does not guarantee that the rectangle can be divided into two equal parts by a diagonal.

2. The condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is also incorrect. This condition is trying to check if `a` and `b` are equal, but the syntax is incorrect and the logic is flawed.

3. The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is incorrect. This condition is trying to check if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, but it is not relevant to the problem.

4. The condition `else: print('no')` is incorrect. This condition is trying to print 'no' if none of the above conditions are met, but it does not provide a correct solution to the problem.

The correct solution to the problem is to check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` is greater than 1. If the GCD is greater than 1, it means that the rectangle can be divided into two equal parts by a diagonal, and the program should print 'yes'. Otherwise, it should print 'no'.

Here is the correct code:

```python
import math

for i in range(int(input())):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    
    if math.gcd(a, b) > 1:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')
```

Correctness: **False**
