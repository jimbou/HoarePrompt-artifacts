Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the two integers from the input, and `i` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin now contains one less test case than before, since one test case has been read and processed.
