Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is `t`, stdin contains no test cases.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will have reached the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The input stream `stdin` will be empty, as all test cases will have been processed. The variables `a` and `b` will still be integers, but their values will be the last values read from the input stream.
