Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 1, `balance_info` is a list containing two elements which are `BalanceInfo(balance-1, i, s[i])`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is 0 and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a close parenthesis ")", then `balance` is -2 and `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `balance` in `balance_info` has been decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The length of the string `s` and the value of `n` are still the same, and the structure of `balance_info` is still a list containing two elements. However, the value of `balance` has been updated to reflect the decrement operation.
