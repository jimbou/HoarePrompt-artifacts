Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000, n is the length of s, balance_info is a list containing n elements which are BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]), balance is the difference between the number of "(" and ")" in s.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length of `s` is still `n`, and the `balance_info` list contains `n` elements, each representing the balance information at each index `i` of the string `s`. The `balance` variable now holds the difference between the number of open parentheses "(" and close parentheses ")" in the string `s`.
