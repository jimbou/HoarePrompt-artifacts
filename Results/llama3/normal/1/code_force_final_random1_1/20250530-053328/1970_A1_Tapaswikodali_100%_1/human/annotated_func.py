#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects of a class with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer and 'position' is a non-negative integer.
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and infoB, where both balances are integers and not equal to each other.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects of a class with attributes 'balance' and 'position', where 'balance' is an integer and 'position' is a non-negative integer. The balance of infoA is equal to the balance of infoB.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position of infoB and the position of infoA, where both infoA and infoB have the same balance.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares two objects, infoA and infoB, based on their 'balance' and 'position' attributes. If the balances are not equal, it returns the difference between the balances. If the balances are equal, it returns the difference between the positions of infoB and infoA.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000.
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000, n is the length of s, balance_info is a list containing n elements which are BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]), balance is the difference between the number of "(" and ")" in s.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: a string consisting of characters from s, sorted by balance and then by position in descending order

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a non-empty string of up to 500,000 characters consisting only of "(" and ")" as input. It calculates the balance of the string (the difference between the number of "(" and ")") and sorts the characters by this balance and then by their original position in descending order. The function returns a string consisting of the sorted characters and prints this string. The input string is not modified.
