Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than the current value of `i` plus one, `balance_info` is a list containing three elements which are `BalanceInfo(balance, i+1, s[i+1])`, `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`**

In this output state, the value of `s` remains the same as it was in the initial state, a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" with a length not exceeding 500,000. The value of `n` also remains unchanged, representing the length of `s` and being greater than the current value of `i` plus one. The `balance_info` list has been updated to include an additional element, `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`, making it a list of three elements.
