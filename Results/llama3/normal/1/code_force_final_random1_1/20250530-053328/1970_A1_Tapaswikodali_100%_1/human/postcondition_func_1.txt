The function takes a non-empty string of up to 500,000 characters consisting only of "(" and ")" as input. It calculates the balance of the string (the difference between the number of "(" and ")") and sorts the characters by this balance and then by their original position in descending order. The function returns a string consisting of the sorted characters and prints this string. The input string is not modified.
