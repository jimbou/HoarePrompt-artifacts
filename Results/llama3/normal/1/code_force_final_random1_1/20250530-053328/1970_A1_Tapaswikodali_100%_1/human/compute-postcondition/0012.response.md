Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 1, `balance_info` is a list containing two elements which are `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is 2 and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a close parenthesis ")", then `balance` is -1 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `balance` is updated by subtracting 1 from its previous value and `i` is 1.***
