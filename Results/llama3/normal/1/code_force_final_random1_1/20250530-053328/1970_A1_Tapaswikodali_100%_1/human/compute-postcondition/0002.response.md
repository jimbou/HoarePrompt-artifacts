Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 0, `balance_info` is a list containing one element which is `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`, `balance` is 0, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the code has appended a new element to the `balance_info` list, which contains the current balance, index, and character at that index in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
