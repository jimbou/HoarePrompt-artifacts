Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000, n is the length of s, balance_info is a sorted list containing n elements which are BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]), balance is the difference between the number of "(" and ")" in s, result is a string consisting of characters from s, sorted by balance and then by position in descending order.**

The code first sorts the balance_info list based on the balance and position of each BalanceInfo object. The sorting is done in ascending order of balance and descending order of position. This means that BalanceInfo objects with lower balance values will come first, and if two objects have the same balance, the one with the higher position will come first.

After sorting, the code creates a new string result by joining the characters from the sorted balance_info list. The characters are taken from the BalanceInfo objects in the order they appear in the sorted list.

Since the sorting is based on the balance and position, the resulting string will have the characters from s, but in a different order. The characters with lower balance values will come first, and if two characters have the same balance, the one with the higher position will come first.

Note that the length of the result string is the same as the length of s, which is n. Also, the characters in the result string are still only "(" and ")" characters, as they were in the original string s.
