Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 0, `balance_info` is a list containing one element which is `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`, the current value of `balance` is 1, the current value of `i` is 0, and the current character at index `i` in string `s` is an open parenthesis "("**

The code increments the value of `balance` by 1. Since the initial value of `balance` is 0, the new value of `balance` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still consists only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000. The value of `n` is still the length of `s` and is greater than 0. The list `balance_info` still contains one element, which is `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`, but the value of `balance` inside this element is now 1. The value of `i` is still 0, and the current character at index `i` in string `s` is still an open parenthesis "(".
