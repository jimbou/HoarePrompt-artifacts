Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000, n is the length of s, balance_info is an empty list, balance is 0**

The code initializes three variables: `n`, `balance_info`, and `balance`. The first line assigns the length of the string `s` to `n`. The second line creates an empty list and assigns it to `balance_info`. The third line sets `balance` to 0. Since `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000, `n` will be a positive integer not exceeding 500,000. The other two variables, `balance_info` and `balance`, are initialized to an empty list and 0, respectively.
