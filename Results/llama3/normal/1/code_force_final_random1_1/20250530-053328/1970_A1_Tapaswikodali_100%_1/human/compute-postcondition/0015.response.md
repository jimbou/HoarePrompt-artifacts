Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than the current value of `i` plus one, `balance_info` is a list containing three elements which are `BalanceInfo(balance+1, i+1, s[i+1])`, `BalanceInfo(balance+1, i, s[i])`, `balance` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been incremented by 1. The other variables, `s`, `n`, `i`, and `balance_info`, remain unchanged. The list `balance_info` still contains three elements, but the `balance` value in each element has been updated to `balance+1`. The string `s` and its length `n` are still the same, and the relationship between `n` and `i` remains unchanged.
