Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation. The issue lies in the sorting of the balance_info list. The problem description states that the columns of the table should be sorted in increasing order of prefix balance, breaking ties in decreasing order of position. However, the program sorts the list in increasing order of prefix balance, breaking ties in decreasing order of position, but it does not consider the original order of the characters when the prefix balance is the same.

For example, consider the input "(()(()))". The correct output should be "(()(()))", but the program will output "(()(()))" which is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to consider the original order of the characters when the prefix balance is the same. This can be achieved by adding the original index of the character to the BalanceInfo object and using it as a tie-breaker in the sorting. 

Here is the corrected code:

```
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i], i))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position, x.original_index))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)
```

And the BalanceInfo class should be modified to include the original index:

```
class BalanceInfo:
    def __init__(self, balance, position, character, original_index):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
        self.original_index = original_index
```
