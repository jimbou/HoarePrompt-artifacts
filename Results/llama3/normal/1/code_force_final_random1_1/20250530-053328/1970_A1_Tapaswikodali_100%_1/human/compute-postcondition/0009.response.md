Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000, `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is greater than 1, `balance_info` is a list containing two elements which are `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an open parenthesis "(", then `balance` is 1 and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a close parenthesis ")", then `balance` is -1 and `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the list `balance_info` has been updated to contain two elements, where the second element is a new `BalanceInfo` object that reflects the balance and index of the next character in the string `s`. The other variables, `s` and `n`, remain unchanged.
