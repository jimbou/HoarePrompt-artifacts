Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

The print statement is `print(X * C + B)`. To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the values of `X`, `C`, and `B`.

From the initial state, we know that `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers assigned the values of the three integers from the input. We also know that `X` is an integer equal to `A // 2`.

Since `A` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `X` will be an integer between 0 and 15 (inclusive), because `A // 2` performs integer division, which rounds down to the nearest whole number.

Now, let's consider the expression `X * C + B`. We know that `C` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), and `B` is also an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive).

When we multiply `X` (an integer between 0 and 15) by `C` (an integer between 1 and 30), the result will be an integer between 0 and 450 (inclusive), because the maximum value of `X` is 15 and the maximum value of `C` is 30.

Finally, when we add `B` (an integer between 1 and 30) to the result of `X * C`, the final result will be an integer between 1 and 480 (inclusive).

Therefore, the print statement will output an integer between 1 and 480 (inclusive), which is the result of the expression `X * C + B`.

Output: **an integer between 1 and 480 (inclusive)**
