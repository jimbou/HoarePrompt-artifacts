The code accepts three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables A, B, and C, respectively. The input contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). The value of `i` is 0 and `input()` must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`i` is 0, A, B, and C are integers (1 <= A <= 100, 1 <= B, C <= 30), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**
