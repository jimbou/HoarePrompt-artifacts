Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it calculates the minimum cost based on the given conditions.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2 * B) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (C), it is more advantageous to buy yogurts at the regular price. In this case, the program prints the total cost as A * B.

2. If the number of yogurts (A) is even, it is more advantageous to buy yogurts at the promotion price. In this case, the program prints the total cost as A * C / 2.

3. If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, the program calculates the total cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts at the promotion price as possible (X * C, where X is the integer division of A by 2) and buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price (B).

The program's logic correctly covers all possible scenarios, and the calculations are accurate. Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
