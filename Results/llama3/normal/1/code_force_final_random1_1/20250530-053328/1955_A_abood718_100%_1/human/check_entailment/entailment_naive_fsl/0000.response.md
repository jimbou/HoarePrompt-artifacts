Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It considers three cases:

1. If the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2 * B) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (C), it buys all yogurts at the regular price (A * B).

2. If the number of yogurts (A) is even, it buys all yogurts at the promotion price (A * C / 2).

3. If the number of yogurts (A) is odd, it buys (A // 2) pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (X * C) and one yogurt at the regular price (B).

The program handles all possible cases correctly, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
