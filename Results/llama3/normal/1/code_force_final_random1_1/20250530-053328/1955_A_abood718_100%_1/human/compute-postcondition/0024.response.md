Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, A, B, and C are integers (1 <= A, B, C <= 30), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If A is even, the integer value of A * C / 2 is being printed. If A is odd, the value of X * C + B is being printed, where X is an integer (0 <= X <= 15).***
