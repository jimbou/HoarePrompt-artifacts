Output State: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers (1 <= A, B, C <= 30), `A`, `B`, and `C` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**

In this output state, the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are updated to the three integers from the input, and the stdin now contains t-3 lines of input. The value of `i` remains the same, which is 2.
