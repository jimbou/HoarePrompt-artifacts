Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts, considering the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles.

The program correctly handles three scenarios:

1. When the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2a) is less than the promotion price (b), it calculates the minimum cost as n * a.
2. When the number of yogurts (n) is even, it calculates the minimum cost as (n / 2) * b.
3. When the number of yogurts (n) is odd, it calculates the minimum cost as (n // 2) * b + a, where (n // 2) is the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price, and a is the price of the remaining single yogurt.

The program correctly uses integer division (//) to calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price, ensuring that the result is an integer.

The program also correctly handles the case where n is 1, as the minimum cost would be simply a.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying n yogurts, considering the promotion and the constraints on the input values.

Correctness: **True**
