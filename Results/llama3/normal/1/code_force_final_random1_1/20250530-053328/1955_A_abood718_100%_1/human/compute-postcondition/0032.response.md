Output State: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers (1 <= A, B, C <= 30), `A`, `B`, and `C` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, `X` is an integer equal to `A // 2`, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**

In this output state, the value of `X` is calculated by performing integer division of `A` by 2, which means `X` will be the largest integer less than or equal to half of `A`. The values of `i`, `A`, `B`, `C`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
