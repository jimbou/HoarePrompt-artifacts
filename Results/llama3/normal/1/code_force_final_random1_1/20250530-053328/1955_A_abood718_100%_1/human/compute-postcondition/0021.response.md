Output State: **`i` is 1, A, B, and C are integers (1 <= A, B, C <= 30), X is an integer (0 <= X <= 15), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**

In this output state, the value of X is calculated as the integer division of A by 2, which means X can be any integer between 0 and 15 (inclusive) since A is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive). The values of i, A, B, C, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
