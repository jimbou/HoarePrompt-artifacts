This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers: n, a, and b. For each case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of items that can be purchased with a and b, considering the constraints that a and b are limited to 30 and n is limited to 100. The function handles three scenarios: when 2a is less than b, when n is even, and when n is odd. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and does not produce any further output.
