Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
    if B * 2 < C:
        print(A * B)
    elif A % 2 == 0:
        print(int(A * C / 2))
    else:
        X = A // 2
        print(X * C + B)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, A, B, and C are integers (1 <= A <= 100, 1 <= B, C <= 30), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If B is less than half of C, the product of A and B is printed. If B is larger than or equal to half of C, then if A is even, the integer value of A * C / 2 is printed. If A is odd, the value of X * C + B is printed, where X is an integer between 0 and 49.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, A, B, and C are integers (1 <= A, B, C <= 30), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If B * 2 < C, the product of A and B is being printed. Otherwise, if A is even, the integer value of A * C / 2 is being printed. If A is odd, the value of X * C + B is being printed, where X is an integer (0 <= X <= 15).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers (1 <= A, B, C <= 30), `A`, `B`, and `C` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If `B` is less than half of `C`, the product of `A` and `B` is printed. Otherwise, if `A` is even, the integer part of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, `X` is an integer equal to `A // 2` and `X * C + B` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
