The code prints the product of A and B, where A and B are integers. A is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and B is between 1 and 30 (inclusive). Since the current value of B is less than half of C, and C is between 1 and 30 (inclusive), the value of B is less than 15.

Output: **A * B (where A is an integer between 1 and 100, and B is an integer less than 15)**
