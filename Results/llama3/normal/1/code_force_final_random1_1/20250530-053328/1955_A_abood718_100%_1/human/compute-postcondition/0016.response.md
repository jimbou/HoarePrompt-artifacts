Output State: **`i` is 1, A, B, and C are integers (1 <= A, B, C <= 30), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**

Explanation: The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` reads a line from the standard input, splits it into three integers, and assigns them to the variables A, B, and C. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three integers, after reading one line, there will be t-3 lines left. The values of A, B, and C are now integers between 1 and 30, as specified by the input constraints. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
