The code prints the result of the expression `X * C + B`, where `X` is an integer between 0 and 15 (inclusive), `C` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), and `B` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive).

Since the exact values of `X`, `C`, and `B` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the given ranges, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **A value between 1 and 465 (inclusive), which is the result of multiplying X (an integer between 0 and 15) by C (an integer between 1 and 30) and adding B (an integer between 1 and 30)**
