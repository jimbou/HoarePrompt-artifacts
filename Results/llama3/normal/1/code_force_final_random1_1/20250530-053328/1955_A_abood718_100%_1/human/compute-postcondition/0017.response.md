Based on the initial state, the code `print(A * B)` will print the product of the integers A and B.

Since A and B are integers between 1 and 30 (inclusive), the product A * B will be an integer between 1 and 900 (inclusive).

However, without knowing the exact values of A and B, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the product.

Therefore, the output will be the product of the values of A and B, which are integers between 1 and 30.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers between 1 and 30)**
