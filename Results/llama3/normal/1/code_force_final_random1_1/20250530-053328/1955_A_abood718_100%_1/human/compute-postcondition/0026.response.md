The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the number of lines in `stdin`. If `i` is less than the number of lines in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `stdin` must contain at least `t-2` lines.
State: **`i` is 2, A, B, and C are integers (1 <= A, B, C <= 30), stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If B * 2 < C, the product of A and B is being printed. Otherwise, if A is even, the integer value of A * C / 2 is being printed. If A is odd, the value of X * C + B is being printed, where X is an integer (0 <= X <= 15).**
