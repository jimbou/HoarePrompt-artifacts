Output State: **`i` is 0, A is an odd integer between 1 and 100, B and C are integers between 1 and 30, B * 2 is larger than or equal to C, X is an integer between 0 and 49, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**

In this output state, the value of X is calculated as the integer division of A by 2, which results in an integer between 0 and 49 because A is an odd integer between 1 and 100. The other variables and stdin remain unchanged.
