Output: **`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers (1 <= A, B, C <= 30), `A`, `B`, and `C` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, `X` is an integer equal to `A // 2`, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), and this is printed: `X * C + B` where `X` is `A // 2` and `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three integers from the input**
