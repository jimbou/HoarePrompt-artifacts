Reasoning: 

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. 

1. It first checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If so, it calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of yogurts (n) by the regular price (a).

2. If buying two yogurts at the regular price is not cheaper, it checks if the number of yogurts (n) is even. If n is even, it calculates the total cost by multiplying n by the promotion price (b) and dividing by 2 (since the promotion is for two yogurts).

3. If n is odd, it calculates the total cost by first buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (b), and then buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price (a). This is done by dividing n by 2 (integer division), multiplying the result by b, and adding a.

The program correctly handles all possible scenarios and produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
