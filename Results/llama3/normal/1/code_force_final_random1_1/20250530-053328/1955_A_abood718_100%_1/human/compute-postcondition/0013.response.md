Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, A, B, and C are integers (1 <= A <= 100, 1 <= B, C <= 30), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). B * 2 is larger than or equal to C. If A is even, the integer value of A * C / 2 is printed. If A is odd, the value of X * C + B is printed, where X is an integer between 0 and 49.***
