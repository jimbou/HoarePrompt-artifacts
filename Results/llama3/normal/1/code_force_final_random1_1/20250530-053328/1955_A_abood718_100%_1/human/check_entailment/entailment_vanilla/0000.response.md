Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program takes into account the promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads three integers: n (the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy), a (the price for one yogurt), and b (the price for two yogurts on promotion).

3. The program then checks if the price of two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is less than the price of two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If this condition is true, it means that buying yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, so it calculates the total cost as n * a.

4. If the condition in step 3 is false, the program checks if the number of yogurts (n) is even. If n is even, it means that Maxim can buy all yogurts at the promotion price, so it calculates the total cost as (n / 2) * b.

5. If n is odd, the program calculates the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (n // 2) and the remaining yogurt that needs to be bought at the regular price. It then calculates the total cost as (n // 2) * b + a.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
