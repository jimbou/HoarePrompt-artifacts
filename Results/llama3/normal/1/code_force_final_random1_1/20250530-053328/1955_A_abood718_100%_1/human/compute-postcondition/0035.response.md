Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers (1 <= A, B, C <= 30), `A`, `B`, and `C` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If `A` is even, the integer part of the product of `A` and `C` divided by 2 is printed. If `A` is odd, `X` is an integer equal to `A // 2` and `X * C + B` is printed, where `X` is `A // 2` and `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three integers from the input.***
