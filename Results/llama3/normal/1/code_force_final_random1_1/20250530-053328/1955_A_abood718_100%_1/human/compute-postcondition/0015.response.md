To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by the input.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `stdin` contains `t-1` lines. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented, and there must be at least one more line in `stdin` to read.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`i` is 1, A, B, and C are integers (1 <= A <= 100, 1 <= B, C <= 30), stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**

Note that the values of A, B, and C do not change, as they are not directly related to the loop head. The only changes are the increment of `i` and the reduction of the number of lines in `stdin`.
