Output: **`i` is 0, A, B, and C are integers (1 <= A <= 100, 1 <= B, C <= 30), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). The current value of B is less than half of C., and this is printed: the product of A and B which is A*B where A is an integer between 1 and 100, and B is an integer between 1 and 30 and B is less than half of C**
