The `print` statement is printing a string that is created by joining the string representations of the elements in the `res` list, separated by spaces.

The `res` list is defined as a list of `n` values, where each value is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for all `i`. Since `mex` is 0, each value in the `res` list is essentially the negation of the corresponding element in the `ar` list.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output a string that contains the negations of the elements in the `ar` list, separated by spaces.

Output: **The negations of the elements in the ar list, separated by spaces**
