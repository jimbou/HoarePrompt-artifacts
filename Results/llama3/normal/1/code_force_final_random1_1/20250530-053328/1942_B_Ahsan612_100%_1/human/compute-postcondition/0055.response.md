Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. It accepts an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n). The function calculates the minimum value (mex) in the result list and prints the list of differences between mex and each corresponding element in the input list. The function processes all test cases and prints the results for each case.**
