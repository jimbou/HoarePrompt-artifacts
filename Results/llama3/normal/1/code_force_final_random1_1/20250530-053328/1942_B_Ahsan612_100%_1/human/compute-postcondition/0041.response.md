Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for `i = len(ar) - 1` and `res[j]` is `None` for all `j != i`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, `_` is `2`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, and the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `mex` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, which is less than the original value of `mex` since `ar[i]` is a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
