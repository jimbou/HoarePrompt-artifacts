Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of n integers, `res` is a list of n values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for all i, `mex` is the minimum value in `res`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is -1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the list `res` fully populated with values calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i`. The variable `mex` will be updated to be the minimum value in the list `res`. The loop counter `i` will be -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The other variables `_` and `stdin` remain unchanged, with `_` still being 0 and `stdin` still containing t-1 test cases.
