Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[len(ar) - 3]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `mex` is `max(mex, mex - ar[len(ar) - 3])`, `_` is `2`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `len(ar) - 3. If mex > mex - ar[i], mex is updated to mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]**

In this output state, the value of `res[i]` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, where `i` is `len(ar) - 3`. The value of `mex` has also been updated to `max(mex, mex - ar[len(ar) - 3])` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
