Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and `res[j]` is None for all `j` not equal to `i`, `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]` if `mex` is not greater than `mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` remains `n`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `len(ar) - 2. If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[len(ar) - 2]` if `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]` is not greater than `n - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, otherwise `mex` remains `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.***
