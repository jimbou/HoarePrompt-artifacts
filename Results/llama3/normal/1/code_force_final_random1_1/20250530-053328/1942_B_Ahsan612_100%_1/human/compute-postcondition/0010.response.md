Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 1]` is `n - ar[n - 1]`, `res[n - 2]` is `mex - ar[n - 2]`, and the rest are None, `mex` is `mex - ar[n - 2]` if `mex > mex - ar[n - 2]`, otherwise `mex` remains the same, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is n - 2***
