To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is being iterated over the range `len(ar) - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be decremented by 1, since the step is `-1`. Therefore, `i` should be `n - 2`.

The other variables in the state, such as `n`, `ar`, `res`, `mex`, `_`, and `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 1]` is `n - ar[n - 1]` and the rest are None, `mex` is `mex - ar[n - 1]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` remains the same, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is n - 2**
