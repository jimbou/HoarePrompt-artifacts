The code prints a string of space-separated values from the `res` list. The `res` list contains values calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` in the `ar` list. Here, `mex` is the minimum value in the `res` list.

Since the exact values of `ar` and `mex` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values in the `res` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated differences between `mex` and each element in `ar`.

Output: **[mex - ar[0]] [mex - ar[1]] ... [mex - ar[n-1]] (where mex is the minimum value in the res list and ar[i] are the elements of the ar list)**
