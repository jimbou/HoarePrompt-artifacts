Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where res[i] is mex - ar[i] for all i, mex is the minimum value in res, _ is t-1, stdin contains 0 test cases, i is -1, and the list res is printed, where each element of res is the difference between the minimum value in res (mex) and the corresponding element in ar**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input, and for each test case, it has computed the result list `res` where each element is the difference between the minimum value in `res` (mex) and the corresponding element in the input list `ar`. The loop has also printed the result list `res` for each test case. The loop has finished executing, and there are no more test cases to process in the input.
