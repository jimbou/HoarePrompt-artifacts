The code `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` assigns the value of `mex - ar[i]` to the `i-th` index of the list `res`. 

Since `i` is `n - 1`, `res[n - 1]` is assigned the value of `mex - ar[n - 1]`. 

The value of `mex` is `n` and `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, so the value of `res[n - 1]` is `n - ar[n - 1]`.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 1]` is `n - ar[n - 1]` and the rest are None, `mex` is n, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is n - 1**
