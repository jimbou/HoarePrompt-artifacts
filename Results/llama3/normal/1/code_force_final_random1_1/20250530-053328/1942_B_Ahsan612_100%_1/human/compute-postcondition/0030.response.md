Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and `res[j]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` for all `j` not equal to `i`, `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]` if `mex` is not greater than `mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` remains `n`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `len(ar) - 3. If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `n - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[len(ar) - 2]` if `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]` is not greater than `n - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, otherwise `mex` remains `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `res[i]` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, and the value of `mex` has been updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state. The values of the other variables remain the same.
