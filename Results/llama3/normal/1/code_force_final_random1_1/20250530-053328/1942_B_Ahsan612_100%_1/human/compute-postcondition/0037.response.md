Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where res[i] is None for all i, mex is n, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is -n**

The code snippet provided reads the value of `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. It then reads a list of `n` integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `ar`. The variable `res` is initialized as a list of `n` `None` values. The variable `mex` is assigned the value of `n`. The values of `_` and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 2.
