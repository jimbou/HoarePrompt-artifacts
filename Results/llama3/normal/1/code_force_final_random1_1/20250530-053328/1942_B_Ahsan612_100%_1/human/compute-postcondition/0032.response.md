Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and `res[j]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` for all `j` not equal to `i`. If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`. `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, and `i` is `len(ar) - 3.**
