Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and `res[j]` is None for all `j` not equal to `i`, `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]` if `mex` is not greater than `mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` remains `n`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `len(ar) - 2**

In this output state, the value of `res[i]` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, where `i` is `len(ar) - 2`. The values of the other variables remain the same. Note that `mex` is still dependent on the condition `mex` is not greater than `mex - ar[i]`, otherwise it remains `n`.
