Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of n integers, `res` is a list of n values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for all i, `mex` is the minimum value in `res`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is -1, and the list `res` is printed, where each element of `res` is the difference between the minimum value in `res` (mex) and the corresponding element in `ar`**
