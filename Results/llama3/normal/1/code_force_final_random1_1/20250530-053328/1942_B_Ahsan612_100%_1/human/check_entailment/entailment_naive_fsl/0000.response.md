Correctness: **True**

The program correctly constructs a valid permutation p that satisfies the given array a. The key insight is to start from the end of the array and work backwards. The program uses a variable `mex` to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the constructed permutation so far. For each element `ar[i]` in the array, it calculates the corresponding element `res[i]` in the permutation as `mex - ar[i]`. Then, it updates `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `mex - ar[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the constructed permutation so far.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the input array is empty (in which case the output is an empty permutation). It also correctly handles cases where the input array contains negative numbers or zeros.

Overall, the program is correct and produces the expected output for all possible inputs.
