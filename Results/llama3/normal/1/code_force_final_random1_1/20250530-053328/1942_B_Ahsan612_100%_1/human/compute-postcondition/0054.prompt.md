Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = [None] * n
    mex = n
    for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
        res[i] = mex - ar[i]
        if mex > mex - ar[i]:
            mex = mex - ar[i]
    print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of n integers, `res` is a list of n values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for all i, `mex` is the minimum value in `res`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is -1, and the list `res` is printed, where each element of `res` is the difference between the minimum value in `res` (mex) and the corresponding element in `ar`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where res[i] is mex - ar[i] for all i, mex is the minimum value in the list ar, _ is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is -n, and the list res is printed, where each element in res is the difference between the minimum value in the list ar and the corresponding element in the list ar

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where res[i] is mex - ar[i] for all i, mex is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is -1, and the list of values of res is printed where each value is the difference between mex and the corresponding element in ar




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
