To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `ar`. The loop will execute as long as `ar` has at least one element. Since `n` is the length of `ar` and is greater than 0, we can conclude that `ar` has at least one element. Therefore, the loop will execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is None for all `i`, `mex` is `n`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `len(ar) - 1**
