Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[len(ar) - 3]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `mex` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `_` is `2`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `len(ar) - 3. If mex > mex - ar[i], mex is updated to mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mex` is updated to be the difference between its previous value and the value of `ar` at index `i` (which is `len(ar) - 3`). The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mex` is now `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, and the value of `res[len(ar) - 3]` is still `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`.
