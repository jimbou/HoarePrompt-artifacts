The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `len(ar) - 3`.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[len(ar) - 3]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]` and `res[j]` is `None` for all `j != len(ar) - 3`, `mex` is `max(mex, mex - ar[len(ar) - 3])`, `_` is `2`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `len(ar) - 3. If mex > mex - ar[i], mex is updated to mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]**
