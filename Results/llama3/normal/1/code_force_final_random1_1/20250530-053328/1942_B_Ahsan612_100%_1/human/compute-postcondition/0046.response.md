Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `res[j]` is `None` for all `j != len(ar) - 2`, `mex` is `max(mex, mex - ar[len(ar) - 2])`, `_` is `2`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `len(ar) - 2. If mex > mex - ar[i], mex is updated to mex - ar[len(ar) - 2].***
