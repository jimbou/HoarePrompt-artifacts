To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` and `stdin`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more test cases in `stdin`. Since `_` is just a dummy variable, we don't need to adjust its state.

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least `t-3` test cases.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is mex - `ar[i]` for all `i`, `mex` is the minimum value in the list `ar`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is -n**
