Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where res[i] is mex - ar[i] for all i, mex is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is -1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `res` is fully populated with the differences between the initial value of `mex` and each element in the list `ar`. The value of `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and the differences between `mex` and each element in `ar`, which ultimately results in `mex` being 0. The variable `i` is -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The other variables `_` and `stdin` remain unchanged.
