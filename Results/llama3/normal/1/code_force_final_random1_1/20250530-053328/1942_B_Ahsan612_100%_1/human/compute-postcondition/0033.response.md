Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where res[i] is mex - ar[i] for all i, mex is the minimum value in the list ar, _ is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is -n**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `res` contains the differences between the minimum value in the list `ar` and each element in `ar`. The variable `mex` is updated to be the minimum value in the list `ar`. The other variables remain unchanged.
