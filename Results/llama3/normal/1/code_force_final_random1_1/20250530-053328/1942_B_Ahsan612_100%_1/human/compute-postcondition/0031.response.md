Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and `res[j]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` for all `j` not equal to `i`, `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[i]`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `len(ar) - 3.**

In this output state, the value of `mex` has been updated to `n - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[i]`, which is the result of subtracting `ar[i]` from the previous value of `mex`. The other variables remain unchanged.
