Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and `res[j]` is None for all `j` not equal to `i`, `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]` if `mex` is not greater than `mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` remains `n`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `len(ar) - 2, mex` is now `n - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[len(ar) - 2]` if `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]` is not greater than `n - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, otherwise `mex` remains `n - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mex` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the difference between `n` and the last two elements of `ar`. All other variables remain unchanged.
