Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input from stdin, which includes the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, and the elements of the array `a`.
2.  It initializes an empty list `res` to store the result and a variable `mex` to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.
3.  The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `a_i`, it calculates the corresponding element in the permutation `p` as `mex - a_i` and stores it in the result list `res`.
4.  After calculating each element in the permutation, the program updates the `mex` value to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated element in the permutation. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
5.  Finally, the program prints the result list `res` for each test case.

The execution summary provided confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing multiple test cases and printing the results correctly.

Correctness: **True**
