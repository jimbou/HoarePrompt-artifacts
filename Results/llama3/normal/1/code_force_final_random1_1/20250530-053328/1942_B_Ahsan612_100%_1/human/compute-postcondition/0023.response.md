Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]` for `i` equals `len(ar) - 1` and `res[j]` is None for all `j` not equal to `i`, `mex` is `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `len(ar) - 1. The current value of `mex` is not greater than the value of `mex` minus `ar[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `mex` has been updated to `n - ar[len(ar) - 1]`, which is the result of subtracting the last element of the list `ar` from `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the condition "The current value of `mex` is greater than the value of `mex` minus `ar[i]`" is no longer true, as the value of `mex` has been updated.
