Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`. The key insight is to iterate through the array `a` in reverse order and calculate the value of `p_i` as `mex - a_i`, where `mex` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` constructed so far.

The program initializes `mex` to `n` and then iterates through the array `a` in reverse order. For each `a_i`, it calculates `p_i` as `mex - a_i` and updates `mex` to be the minimum value between the current `mex` and `mex - a_i`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` constructed so far.

The program then prints the constructed permutation `p` as the output.

The execution states of the program provided as comments match the expected behavior of the program, and the output of the program matches the expected output for the given input.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
