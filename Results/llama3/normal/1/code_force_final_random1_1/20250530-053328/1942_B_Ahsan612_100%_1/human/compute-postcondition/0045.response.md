Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `res[j]` is `None` for all `j != len(ar) - 2`, `mex` is `max(mex, mex - ar[len(ar) - 2])`, `_` is `2`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `len(ar) - 2, mex` is updated to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mex` is updated to be the difference between its previous value and the value of `ar` at index `len(ar) - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
