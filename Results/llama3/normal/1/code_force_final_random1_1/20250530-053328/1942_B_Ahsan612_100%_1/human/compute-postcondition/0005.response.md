Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 1]` is `n - ar[n - 1]` and the rest are None, `mex` is `mex - ar[n - 1]`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is n - 1. The current value of `mex` is not greater than `mex - ar[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `mex` has been updated to be `mex - ar[n - 1]`, which is a result of subtracting the value at index `i` (which is `n - 1`) from the current value of `mex`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]` is no longer true, as the value of `mex` has been updated.
