The code prints a string of space-separated values from the list `res`. The list `res` contains values calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` in the list `ar`. Here, `mex` is the minimum value in the list `ar`.

Since the exact values in the list `ar` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values in the list `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated differences between the minimum value in `ar` and each element in `ar`.

Output: **space-separated values of mex - ar[i] for all i (where mex is the minimum value in the list ar and ar[i] are the elements of the list ar)**
