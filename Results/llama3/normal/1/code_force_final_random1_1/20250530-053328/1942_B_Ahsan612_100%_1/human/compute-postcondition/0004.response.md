Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 1]` is `n - ar[n - 1]` and the rest are None, `mex` is initially n, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is n - 1. The current value of `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.***
