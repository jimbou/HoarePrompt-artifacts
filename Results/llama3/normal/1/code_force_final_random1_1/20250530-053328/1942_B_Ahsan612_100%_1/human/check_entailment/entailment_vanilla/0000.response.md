Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses a deque from the collections module to efficiently process the input.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.

3. It initializes an array `res` of size `n` to store the constructed permutation `p`. It also initializes a variable `mex` to `n`, which will be used to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.

4. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `a_i`, it calculates the corresponding element `p_i` in the permutation using the formula `p_i = mex - a_i`. This is based on the given condition that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

5. After calculating `p_i`, the program updates the value of `mex` if `mex` is greater than `p_i`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.

6. Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the program's logic, it appears that the program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.

Correctness: **True**
