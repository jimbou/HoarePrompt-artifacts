The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the expression `int(input())`. If the expression is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, _ is 0, int(input()) must be greater than 0**
