To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `ar`. The loop will execute as long as `ar` has at least one element. Since `n` is the length of `ar`, we can infer that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` will start at `len(ar) - 1`, which is `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of n None values, `mex` is n, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is n - 1**
