Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `n - ar[i]` for `i` equals `len(ar) - 1` and `res[j]` is None for all `j` not equal to `i`, `mex` is `n`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is `len(ar) - 1. The current value of `mex` is greater than the value of `mex` minus `ar[i]`.**
