The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. So now stdin contains t-3 test cases. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `ar`. Stdin now contains t-4 test cases. The third line creates a list of `n` values and assigns it to `res`. The fourth line assigns the value of `n` to `mex`. The value of `n` is an integer greater than 0, and `ar` is a list of `n` integers. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where res[i] is None for all i, mex is n, _ is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is -1**
