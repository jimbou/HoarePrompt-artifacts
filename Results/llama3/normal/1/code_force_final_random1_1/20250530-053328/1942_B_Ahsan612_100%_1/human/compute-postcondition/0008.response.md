Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 1]` is `n - ar[n - 1]`, `res[n - 2]` is `mex - ar[n - 2]`, and the rest are None, `mex` is `mex - ar[n - 1]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `mex` remains the same, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is n - 2**

In this output state, the value of `res[i]` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, where `i` is `n - 2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `mex` is still dependent on the condition `mex > mex - ar[i]`, and its value is updated accordingly. The other variables, including `n`, `ar`, `_`, and `stdin`, retain their initial values.
