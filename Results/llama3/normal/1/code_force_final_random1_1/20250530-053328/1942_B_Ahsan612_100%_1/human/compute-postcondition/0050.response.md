Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[len(ar) - 3]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `mex` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `_` is `2`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, and `i` is `len(ar) - 3.***
