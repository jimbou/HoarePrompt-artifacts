Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order and calculates the value of `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` constructed so far. The program updates the value of `mex` whenever it finds a smaller value in the array `p`.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `a[i]` is negative or when `mex` is greater than `n`. The program also correctly prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the array `a`, which is efficient for the given constraints. The space complexity is also O(n), which is acceptable for the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
