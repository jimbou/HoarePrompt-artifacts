Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of n values where `res[n - 1]` is `n - ar[n - 1]`, `res[n - 2]` is `mex - ar[n - 2]`, and the rest are None, `mex` is `mex - ar[n - 2]` if `mex > mex - ar[n - 2]`, otherwise `mex` remains the same, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `i` is n - 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the difference between its current value and the second last element of the list `ar`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
