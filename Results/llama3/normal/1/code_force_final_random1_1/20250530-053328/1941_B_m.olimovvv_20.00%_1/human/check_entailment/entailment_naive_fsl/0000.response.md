Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

5
1 3 5 5 2

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to make all the elements of the array zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the first and last elements of the array can be made zero, but it does not check if the entire array can be made zero. The program does not consider the fact that the operations can be applied any number of times, and that any index i can be used zero or more times.

A correct solution would need to check if the entire array can be made zero, not just the first and last elements. This would require a more complex algorithm that takes into account the fact that the operations can be applied multiple times and that any index can be used multiple times.
