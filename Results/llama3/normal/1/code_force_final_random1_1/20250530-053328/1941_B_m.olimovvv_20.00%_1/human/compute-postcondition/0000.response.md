To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `stdin`. If the input from `stdin` contains at least one integer, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the input from `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_j <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed, the input from `stdin` must contain at least one integer `t` and `_` is 0.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9), _ is 0**
