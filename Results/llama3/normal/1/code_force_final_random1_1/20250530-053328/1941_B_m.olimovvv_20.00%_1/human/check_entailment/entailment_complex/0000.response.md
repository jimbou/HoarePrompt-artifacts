Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Rudolf can make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operation.

The key insight is that the operation can only decrease the elements of the array, and it can only decrease the elements at indices i-1, i, and i+1 by 1, 2, and 1, respectively. Therefore, the parity of the elements at indices 1 and n-1 must be the same, and the difference between the elements at indices 1 and 2, and between the elements at indices n-2 and n-1, must be 2.

The program correctly checks these conditions and prints 'YES' if they are met, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
