Postcondition: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, b is a list of integers with a length between 3 and 2 * 10^5, stdin is empty. If b has either an odd first element not followed by the number that is 2 more than the first element, or an odd last element not preceded by the number that is 2 less than the last element, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
