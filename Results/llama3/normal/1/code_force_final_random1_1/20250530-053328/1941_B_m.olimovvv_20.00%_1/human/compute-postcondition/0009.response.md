To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`, which means the loop will execute as long as there is input to read from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4
* `b` is a list of integers with a length between 3 and 2 * 10^5
* `stdin` is empty

For the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to have some input. Since `a` and `b` are not part of the loop head, we cannot adjust their states.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `b` is a list of integers with a length between 3 and 2 * 10^5, `stdin` is not empty**

Note that we don't know what the exact input is, but we know that `stdin` is no longer empty, which allows the loop to execute again.
