Based on the precondition, we know that `a` is an integer equal to the next integer in stdin, `b` is a list of integers from stdin, and stdin is empty.

When the print statement `print('YES')` is executed, it will simply print the string 'YES' to the console.

There are no variables or objects being printed that depend on the values of `a` or `b`, so the output does not depend on the contents of stdin.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
