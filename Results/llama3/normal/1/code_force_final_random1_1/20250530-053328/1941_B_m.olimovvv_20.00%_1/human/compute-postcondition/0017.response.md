Output State: **a is an integer equal to the next integer in stdin, b is a list of integers from stdin, stdin is empty**

The first line assigns the next integer from stdin to `a`, replacing its original value. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `b`, replacing its original value. Since stdin is not empty and has at least 1 integer, `a` will be assigned a valid integer value. The list of integers from stdin is split by spaces and converted to integers, which are then assigned to `b`. After the execution of the code, stdin is empty as all its contents have been consumed by the input operations.
