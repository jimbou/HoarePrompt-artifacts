Postcondition: ***a is an integer equal to the next integer in stdin, b is a list of integers from stdin, stdin is empty. If either the first two elements of b do not form a sequence with a difference of 2 or the last two elements of b do not form a sequence with a difference of 2, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
