The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input.  If the input has at least 1 more integer the loop executes again for the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, a is an integer, b is a list of integers, stdin is empty. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin is not empty and has at least 1 integer and _ is the next integer.
State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a list of integers, stdin is not empty and has at least 1 integer, _ is the next integer**
