Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and determines whether a given sequence of integers meets certain conditions. For each test case, it checks if the first and last elements of the sequence satisfy specific parity and difference requirements. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving stdin empty and the input variables in a reset state.**
