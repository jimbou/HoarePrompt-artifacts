Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

The problem statement asks whether it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the given operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i.

The key insight here is that the parity of the elements at indices 1 and n-1 (the first and last elements of the array) determines whether it's possible to make all elements zero. If the parity of these elements is odd, it's impossible to make all elements zero.

The program checks this condition by verifying that if the first element is odd, the second element is equal to the first element plus 2, and if the last element is odd, the second-to-last element is equal to the last element plus 2. If either of these conditions is not met, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

This logic is correct because if the parity of the first and last elements is even, it's always possible to make all elements zero by applying the operation repeatedly. If the parity is odd, it's impossible to make all elements zero because the operation always changes the parity of the elements at indices i-1 and i+1.

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the given operation.

Correctness: **True**
