Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The key insight is that the parity of the first and last elements of the array determines whether it's possible to make all elements zero. If the first element is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element is odd and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, then it's not possible to make all elements zero.

The program correctly checks these conditions and prints 'YES' if the conditions are met, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
