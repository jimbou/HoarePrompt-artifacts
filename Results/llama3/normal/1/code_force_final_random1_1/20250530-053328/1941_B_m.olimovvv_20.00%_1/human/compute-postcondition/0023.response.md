Output State: **a is an integer equal to 0, b is an empty list, stdin is empty. Either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed for each test case.**

The loop will execute until there are no more test cases in the input. After each iteration, the value of 'a' will be updated to the next integer in the input, and the list 'b' will be updated to the next list of integers in the input. The loop will continue until there are no more integers or lists of integers in the input, at which point 'a' will be 0 and 'b' will be an empty list. The output will be either 'NO' or 'YES' for each test case, depending on whether the conditions in the loop are met.
