Output State: **t is a positive integer between 3 and 10^4, i is 2, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is 1, g is n / 2, and the integer part of ans which is n + sum(int(n / count) + 1) from count = 2 to m is being printed. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, as the `break` statement only terminates the innermost loop or conditional statement, without modifying any variable values. The condition that the current value of `g` is less than the current value of `countmins` remains valid.
