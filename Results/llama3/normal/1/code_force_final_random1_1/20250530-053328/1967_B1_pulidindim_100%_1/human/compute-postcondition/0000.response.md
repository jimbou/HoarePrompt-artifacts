The code `t = int(input())` reads the first line from the stdin, which contains a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).**
