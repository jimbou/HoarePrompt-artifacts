Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater or equal to 4, `count` is 4 and must be less than `m`, `ans` is `n + int(g / 2) + 1 + int((g - countmins) / count) + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `int(n / count)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
