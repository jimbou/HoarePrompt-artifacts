Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4, i is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is 1. If n/2 is less than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of t, i, n, m, count, ans, countmins, and g.***
