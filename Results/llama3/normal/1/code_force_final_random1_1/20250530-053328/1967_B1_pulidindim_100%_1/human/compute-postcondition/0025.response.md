Output State: **t is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4, i is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is 1, g is n/2**

In this output state, the value of `countmins` is 1, which is the result of subtracting 1 from the initial value of `count`, which was 2. The value of `g` is `n/2`, which is the result of dividing `n` by the initial value of `count`, which was 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
