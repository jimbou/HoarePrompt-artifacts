Output State: **t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, n is an integer, m is greater than 4, count is 4, ans is n + int(g / count) + 1 + int((g - countmins) / count) + 1, countmins is 3, g is int(n / count).**

The code snippet modifies the values of `countmins` and `g`. The first line assigns the value of `int(count - 1)` to `countmins`, making `countmins` equal to 3. The second line assigns the value of `int(n / count)` to `g`. Since `count` is 4, `g` becomes `int(n / 4)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
