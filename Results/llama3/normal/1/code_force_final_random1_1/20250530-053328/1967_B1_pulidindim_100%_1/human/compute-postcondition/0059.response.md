Postcondition: **t is a positive integer between 3 and 10^4, i is 2, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 5, count is less than m and is one more than its original value, ans is n + sum(int(n / count) + 1) from count = 2 to 3 plus int(g / count) + 1, countmins is less than or equal to m - 1 and is equal to count - 1, g is n / count minus countmins and is equal to int(n / count). If g is less than countmins, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
