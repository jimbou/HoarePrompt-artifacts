Output State: **t is a positive integer between 3 and 10^4, i is 2, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 4, count is less than or equal to m, ans is n + sum(int(n / count) + 1) from count = 2 to 3, countmins is less than or equal to m - 1, g is n / count, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables t, i, n, m, count, ans, countmins, and g remain unchanged.
