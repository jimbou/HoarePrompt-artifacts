The only variable in the loop head is variable count, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable count.  If count is less than or equal to m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, count is 4, m is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to be executed one more time, count must be less than or equal to m. So count must be less than or equal to m and count must be less than m.
State: **t is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4, i is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater or equal to 4, count is 4 and must be less than m, ans is n + int(g / 2) + 1 + int((g - countmins) / count) + 1, countmins is 2, g is int(n / count).**
