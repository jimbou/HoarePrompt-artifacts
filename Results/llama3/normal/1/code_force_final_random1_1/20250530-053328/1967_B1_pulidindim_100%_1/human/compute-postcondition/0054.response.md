Postcondition: **t is a positive integer between 3 and 10^4, i is 2, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 4, count is less than or equal to m, ans is n + sum(int(n / count) + 1) from count = 2 to 3, countmins is less than or equal to m - 1, g is n / count. If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
