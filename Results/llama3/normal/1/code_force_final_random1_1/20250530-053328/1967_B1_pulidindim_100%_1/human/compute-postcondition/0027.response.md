Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is less than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a `break` statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. The values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program flow is altered as it breaks out of the loop or conditional statement.
