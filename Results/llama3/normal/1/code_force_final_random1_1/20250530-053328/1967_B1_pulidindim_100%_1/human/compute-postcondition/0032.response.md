Output State: **t is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4, i is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater or equal to 4, count is 3, ans is n + int(g / 2) + 1, countmins is 2, g is int(n / count) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables retain their initial values, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
