Output State: **t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, i is 0, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is 1, g is n/2**

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns the value of `count - 1` to `countmins`. Since `count` is 2, `countmins` becomes 1. The second line assigns the value of `n / count` to `g`. Since `count` is 2, `g` becomes `n/2`. No other variables are affected.
