Postcondition: **t is a positive integer between 3 and 10^4, i is 2, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is 1, g is n / 2, and the integer part of ans which is n + sum(int(n / count) + 1) from count = 2 to m is being printed. The current value of g is less than the current value of countmins.**
