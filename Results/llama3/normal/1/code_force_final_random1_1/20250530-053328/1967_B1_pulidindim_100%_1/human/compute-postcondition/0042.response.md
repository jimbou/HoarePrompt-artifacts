Output: **t is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4, i is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, count is m + 1, ans is n + sum(int(n / count) + 1) from count = 2 to m, countmins is m - 1, g is int(n / m), and the integer part of ans which is n + sum(int(n / count) + 1) from count = 2 to m is being printed**
