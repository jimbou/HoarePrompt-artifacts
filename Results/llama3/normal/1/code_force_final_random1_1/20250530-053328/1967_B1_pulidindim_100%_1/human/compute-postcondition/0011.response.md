Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / count)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement, without modifying any variable values.
