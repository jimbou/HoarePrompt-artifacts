Output State: **t is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4, i is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater or equal to 4, count is 3, ans is n + int(g / 2) + 1, countmins is 2, g is int(n / count)**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same. The value of `n` and `m` are also unchanged. The value of `count` is also unchanged. The value of `ans` is also unchanged. The value of `countmins` is decremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `g` is recalculated as the integer division of `n` by `count`, which is 3.
