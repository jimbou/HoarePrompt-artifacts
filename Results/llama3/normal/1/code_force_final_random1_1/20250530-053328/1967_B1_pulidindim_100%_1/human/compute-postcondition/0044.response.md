Output State: **t is a positive integer between 3 and 10^4, i is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is m - 1, g is int(n / m), and the integer part of ans which is n + sum(int(n / count) + 1) from count = 2 to m is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `count` is reset to 2, and the value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `n`. The integer part of `ans` is still being printed.
