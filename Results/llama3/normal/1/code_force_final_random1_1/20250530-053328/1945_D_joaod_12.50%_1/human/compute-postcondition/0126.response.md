Output: **cases is at least 2, c is 2, na_frente is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, stdin is empty, v is -1. If v is less than or equal to pos_final, then if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] is less than custo_pra_passar_b[v], total is increased by custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]. Otherwise, total is increased by custo_pra_passar_b[-1]. If best is greater than total plus custo_pra_trocar_a[-1], then best is updated to total plus custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]. If v is greater than pos_final, then if the last element of custo_pra_trocar_a is less than the last element of custo_pra_passar_b, total is increased by the last element of custo_pra_trocar_a. Otherwise, total is increased by the last element of custo_pra_passar_b, and best is printed, where best is the minimum cost between custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b based on the conditions described above**
