Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, and stdin contains -2 inputs. If the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`, then `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.***
