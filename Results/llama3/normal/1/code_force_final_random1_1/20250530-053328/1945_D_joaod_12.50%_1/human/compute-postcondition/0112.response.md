Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `v` is -1. If the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.***
