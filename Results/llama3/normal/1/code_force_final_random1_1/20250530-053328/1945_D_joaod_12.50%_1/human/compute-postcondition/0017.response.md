Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is increased by the cost to pass b at position `v`, `best` is 10^12, stdin contains 0 inputs, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. The cost to change a at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass b at position `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the cost to pass b at position `v`, which is stored in the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. All other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `v`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final` is still valid, and the cost to change a at position `v` is still greater than or equal to the cost to pass b at position `v`.
