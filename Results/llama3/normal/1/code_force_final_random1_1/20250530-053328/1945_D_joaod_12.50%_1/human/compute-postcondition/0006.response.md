Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `best` is equal to `total` plus the element at index `na_frente` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `v` is `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of cases is at least 1, the value of c is 0, na_frente is an integer that is 1 less than its original value and is greater than or equal to 0, pos_final is an integer that is 1 less than its original value, custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b are lists of integers, the total is 0, the best value is now the sum of the total and the cost to change at the current position na_frente, v is equal to na_frente and is less than or equal to pos_final, and there are no more inputs in stdin.
