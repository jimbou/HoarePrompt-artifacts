To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `v` and `na_frente`. The loop will execute as long as `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, we can infer that the original value of `na_frente` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `best` is 10^12, `stdin` is empty, `v` is `na_frente`**
