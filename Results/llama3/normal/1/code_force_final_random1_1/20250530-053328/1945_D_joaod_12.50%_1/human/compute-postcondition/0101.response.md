Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is the original value of `total` plus the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, `best` is 10^12, `stdin` is empty, `v` is `na_frente` and `v` is larger than `pos_final`, and the cost to change `a` at position `v` is not less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, which is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `total` is now the original value of `total` (which was 0) plus the cost to pass `b` at position `v`.
