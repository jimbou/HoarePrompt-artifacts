Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `v` is 0, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. If `best` is greater than the updated `total`, then `best` is updated to the updated `total`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` is increased by the first element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. If `best` is greater than the updated `total`, then `best` is updated to the updated `total`.
