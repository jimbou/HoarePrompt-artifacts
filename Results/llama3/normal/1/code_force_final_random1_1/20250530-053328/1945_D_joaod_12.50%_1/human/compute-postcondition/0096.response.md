Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `best` is greater than the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. `total` is updated to the sum of its original value and the element at index `v` of either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b`, depending on which one is less. If the cost to change at index `v` is less than the cost to pass at index `v`, then the cost to change at index `v` is used. Otherwise, the cost to pass at index `v` is used.***
