Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`**.

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the last element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b` to it, since `v` is -1, which refers to the last index of the list in Python. The other variables remain unchanged.
