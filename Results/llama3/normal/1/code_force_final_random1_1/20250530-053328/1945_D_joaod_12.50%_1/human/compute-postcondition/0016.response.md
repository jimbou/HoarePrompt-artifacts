Postcondition: ***cases is at least 1, c is 0, na_frente is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, total is 0, best is 10^12, stdin contains 0 inputs, v is na_frente, and v is greater than pos_final. The cost to change a at position v is greater than or equal to the cost to pass b at position v***
