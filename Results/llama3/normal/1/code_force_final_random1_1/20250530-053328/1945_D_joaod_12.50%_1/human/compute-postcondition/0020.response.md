The only variable in the loop head is variable  v, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v`. If `v` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `v` is -1.
State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is the original value of `total` plus the minimum of the element at index `na_frente` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_passar_b` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, otherwise `total` is increased by the cost to either change a or pass b at position `v` depending on which cost is lower, `best` is either its original value or `total` plus the element at index `na_frente` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the latter is greater, `v` is -1, and stdin contains 0 inputs.**
