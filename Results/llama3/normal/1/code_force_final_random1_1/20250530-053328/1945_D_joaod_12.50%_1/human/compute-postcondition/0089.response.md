Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `best` is 10^12, `stdin` is empty, `v` is `na_frente`, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The current value of `best` is greater than the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`***
