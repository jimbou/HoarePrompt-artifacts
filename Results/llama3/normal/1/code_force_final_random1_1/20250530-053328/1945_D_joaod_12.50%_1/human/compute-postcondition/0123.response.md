Postcondition: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `v` is 0. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, otherwise `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`. In both cases, if `best` is greater than the updated `total`, then `best` is updated to the updated `total`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, otherwise `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.**
