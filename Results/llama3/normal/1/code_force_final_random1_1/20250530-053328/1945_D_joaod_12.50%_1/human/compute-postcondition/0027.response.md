Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is the original value of `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_passar_b`, `best` is either its original value or `total` plus the element at index `na_frente` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the latter is greater, `v` is -1, and stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of cases is at least 1, the value of c is 0, the value of na_frente is an integer that is equal to its original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to 0, the value of pos_final is an integer that is equal to its original value minus 1, custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b are lists of integers, the total value is increased by the cost to pass b at position v, the best value is either its original value or the total value plus the cost to change a at position na_frente if the latter is greater, the value of v is -1, and there are no more inputs in stdin.
