Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `v` is `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `best` is updated to the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `best` is greater than this sum. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. `total` is updated to the sum of its original value and the element at index `v` of either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b`, depending on which one is less. If `v` is larger than `pos_final`, then `total` is updated to the sum of its original value and the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if the cost to change `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`. Otherwise, `total` is the original value of `total` plus the cost to pass `b` at position `v`.***
