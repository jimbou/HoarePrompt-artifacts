Postcondition: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, and stdin contains -2 inputs. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`. Additionally, if `best` is less than `total` plus the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if it is less than the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`, otherwise `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.**
