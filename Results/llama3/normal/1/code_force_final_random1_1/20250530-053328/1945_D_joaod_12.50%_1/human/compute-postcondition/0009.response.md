Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is the original value of `total` plus the element at index `na_frente` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `best` is either its original value or `total` plus the element at index `na_frente` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the latter is greater, `v` is `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated to include the cost of changing at index `v` (which is equal to `na_frente`), and the other variables remain unchanged. The cost to change at index `v` is less than the cost to pass at index `v`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The stdin still contains 0 inputs.
