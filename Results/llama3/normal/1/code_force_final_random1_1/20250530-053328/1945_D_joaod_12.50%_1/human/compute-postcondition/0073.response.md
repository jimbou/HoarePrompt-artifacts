Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `best` is `total` plus the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and stdin contains -2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of `total` and the first element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `total` is not specified in the initial state, so it is left as is in the output state.
