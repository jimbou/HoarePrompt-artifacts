The code increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Since `v` is 0, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is the first element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The value of `total` is increased by this first element.

Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and stdin contains -2 inputs.**
