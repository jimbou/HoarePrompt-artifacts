To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `v` and `na_frente`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `best` is 10^12, `v` is `na_frente`, and stdin contains -2 inputs.**
