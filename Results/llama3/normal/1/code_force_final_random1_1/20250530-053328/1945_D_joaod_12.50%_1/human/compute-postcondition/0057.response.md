The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` adds the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to the current value of `total`. Since `total` was initially 0, its new value will be equal to `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.

The other variables are not affected by this code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is equal to `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is 10^12, `v` is `na_frente`, and stdin contains -2 inputs. Additionally, `v` is greater than `pos_final`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
