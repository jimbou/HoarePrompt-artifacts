Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`-1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a`[`na_frente`-1], and stdin contains -2 inputs. If `best` is greater than `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a`[`na_frente`-1], then `best` is updated to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a`[`na_frente`-1].**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a` at index `na_frente`-1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still valid, and if it was true before, `best` will be updated to the new value of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a`[`na_frente`-1].
