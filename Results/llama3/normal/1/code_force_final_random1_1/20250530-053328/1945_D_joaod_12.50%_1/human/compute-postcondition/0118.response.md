Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `v` is 0, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`, and if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of cases is at least 2, and the value of c remains 2. The value of na_frente is still an integer that is at least 0 and is equal to its original value minus 3. Similarly, the value of pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 3. The lists custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b remain unchanged. The standard input is still empty, and the value of v is still 0. The total has increased by the first element of the list custo_pra_passar_b. Additionally, if the value of best is greater than the total plus the first element of the list custo_pra_trocar_a, then the value of best is updated to be equal to the total plus the first element of the list custo_pra_trocar_a.
