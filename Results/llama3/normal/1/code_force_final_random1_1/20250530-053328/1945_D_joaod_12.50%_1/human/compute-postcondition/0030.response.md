To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `v` and `na_frente`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `v` is greater than -1. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is -1. To execute the loop again, `v` must be greater than -1. Since the loop iterates in reverse order (from `na_frente` to -1), the next value of `v` should be the previous value of `na_frente`.

State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is the original value of `total` plus the minimum of the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_passar_b` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, otherwise `total` is increased by the cost to either change a or pass b at position `v` depending on which cost is lower, `best` is either its original value or `total` plus the element at index `na_frente` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the latter is greater, and `v` is the previous value of `na_frente`**
