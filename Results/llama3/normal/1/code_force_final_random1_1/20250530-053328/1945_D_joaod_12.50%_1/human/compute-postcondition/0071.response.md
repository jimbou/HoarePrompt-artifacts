Postcondition: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`-1, and stdin contains -2 inputs. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente-1]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente-1]` depending on which is smaller, and `best` is updated to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente-1]` if it is greater. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente-1]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente-1]`.**
