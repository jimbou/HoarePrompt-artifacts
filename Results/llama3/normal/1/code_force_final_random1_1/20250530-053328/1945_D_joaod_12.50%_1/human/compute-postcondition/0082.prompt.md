Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is at least 1, c is 1, na_frente is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, total is 0, best is 10^12, and stdin contains -2 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, and stdin contains -2 inputs. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated based on the comparison between the cost to change and the cost to pass at index `v`, and if the original value of `best` is greater than the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is either equal to the cost to change at position `v` if the cost to change is less than the cost to pass, or increased by the cost to pass at position `v` if the cost to change is greater than or equal to the cost to pass.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`-1, and stdin contains -2 inputs. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente-1]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente-1]` depending on which is smaller, and `best` is updated to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente-1]` if it is greater. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente-1]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, and stdin contains -2 inputs. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`. Additionally, if `best` is less than `total` plus the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if it is less than the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`, otherwise `total` is increased by the first element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
