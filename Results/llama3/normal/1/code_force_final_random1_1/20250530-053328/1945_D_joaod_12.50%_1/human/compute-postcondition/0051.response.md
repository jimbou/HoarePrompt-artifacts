Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is the sum of its original value and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `v` is `na_frente`, and stdin contains -2 inputs. The current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If the original value of `best` is greater than the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The current value of the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the current value of the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_passar_b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The total cost has been updated by adding the cost of changing at the current position `v` to the previous total cost. All other variables remain unchanged. The current position `v` is still less than or equal to the final position `pos_final`. The best cost is still updated if the new total cost is less than the original best cost. The cost of changing at the current position `v` is still less than the cost of passing at the same position.
