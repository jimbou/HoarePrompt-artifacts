The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Since `v` is -1, it refers to the last element in the list.

Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`.**
