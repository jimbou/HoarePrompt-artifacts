Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is the sum of its original value and the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is 10^12, `stdin` is empty, `v` is `na_frente` and `v` is larger than `pos_final`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated to include the cost of switching at position `v`, which is stored in `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `v`, and the relationship between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` are still satisfied.
