The only variable in the loop head is variable `v`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v`. If `v` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is -1. For the loop to execute again, `v` must be greater than -1, so `v` is 0.
State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, and stdin contains -2 inputs.**
