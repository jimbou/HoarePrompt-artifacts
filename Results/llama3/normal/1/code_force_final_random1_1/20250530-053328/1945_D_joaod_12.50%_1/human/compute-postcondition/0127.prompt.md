Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200000). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains n space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = 10 ** 12
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: cases is at least 1, c is 0, na_frente is -1, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, total is the original value of total plus the sum of the minimum of the element at index v of custo_pra_trocar_a and the element at index v of custo_pra_passar_b for all v from na_frente to -1, best is either its original value or the minimum of the original value of best and the sum of total and the element at index v of custo_pra_trocar_a for all v from na_frente to -1, and stdin contains 0 inputs, and the best value is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cases is at least 1, c is 1, na_frente is -1, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, total is the sum of the minimum of custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b for all indices from na_frente to 0, best is the minimum of the original value of best and the sum of total and the element at index v of custo_pra_trocar_a for all indices v from na_frente to 0, and stdin contains -2 inputs, and the best is printed which is the minimum of the original value of best and the sum of total and the element at index v of custo_pra_trocar_a for all indices v from na_frente to 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cases is at least 2, c is 2, na_frente is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, stdin is empty, v is -1. If v is less than or equal to pos_final, then if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] is less than custo_pra_passar_b[v], total is increased by custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]. Otherwise, total is increased by custo_pra_passar_b[-1]. If best is greater than total plus custo_pra_trocar_a[-1], then best is updated to total plus custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]. If v is greater than pos_final, then if the last element of custo_pra_trocar_a is less than the last element of custo_pra_passar_b, total is increased by the last element of custo_pra_trocar_a. Otherwise, total is increased by the last element of custo_pra_passar_b, and best is printed, where best is the minimum cost between custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b based on the conditions described above




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
