Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is increased by the cost to pass at position `v`, `best` is 10^12, `v` is `na_frente`, and stdin contains -2 inputs. Additionally, `v` is greater than `pos_final`. The cost to change at position `v` is not less than the cost to pass at position `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the cost to pass at position `v`, which is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `v` and `pos_final` are still valid. The stdin still contains -2 inputs.
