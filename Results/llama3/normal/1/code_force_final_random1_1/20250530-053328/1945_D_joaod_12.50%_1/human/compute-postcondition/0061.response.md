Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, and stdin contains -2 inputs. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated based on the comparison between the cost to change and the cost to pass at index `v`, and if the original value of `best` is greater than the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is either equal to the cost to change at position `v` if the cost to change is less than the cost to pass, or increased by the cost to pass at position `v` if the cost to change is greater than or equal to the cost to pass.***
