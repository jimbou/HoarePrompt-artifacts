Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`-1, `best` is `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a`[`na_frente`-1], and stdin contains -2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `best` is calculated by adding `total` and the element at index `v` (which is `na_frente`-1) of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
