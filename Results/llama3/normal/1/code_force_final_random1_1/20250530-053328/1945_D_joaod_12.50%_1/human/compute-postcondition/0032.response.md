Postcondition: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is the original value of `total` plus the minimum of the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_passar_b` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, otherwise `total` is increased by the cost to either change a or pass b at position `v` depending on which cost is lower, and `best` is either its original value or `total` plus the element at index `na_frente` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the latter is greater, and `v` is the previous value of `na_frente`. If `best` is greater than `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`.**
