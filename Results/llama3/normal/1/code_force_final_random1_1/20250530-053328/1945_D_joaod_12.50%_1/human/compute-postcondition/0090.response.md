Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `best` is equal to the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `v` is `na_frente`, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of the current `total` (which is 0) and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `best` is now equal to the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, since `total` is 0.
