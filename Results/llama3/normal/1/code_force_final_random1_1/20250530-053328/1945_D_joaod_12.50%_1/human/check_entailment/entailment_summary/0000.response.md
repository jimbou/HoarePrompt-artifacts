Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move from the end of the queue to a position among the first m people in line. The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m, and two lists of n integers each, representing the costs of swapping and passing at each position.

The program correctly initializes variables, reads input, and calculates the minimum cost to move from the first position to the final position. It uses a greedy approach, iterating from the end of the queue to the beginning, and at each position, it decides whether to swap or pass based on the minimum cost.

The program also correctly handles the boundary condition where the current position is less than or equal to the final position, in which case it updates the best cost if the current cost is less than the best cost found so far.

The execution summary confirms that the program reads multiple test cases, calculates the minimum cost for each test case, and prints the minimum cost.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
