Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is the previous total plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_passar_b`, if `best` is greater than `total` plus the element at index `na_frente` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus the element at index `na_frente` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged, `v` is `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`, stdin contains 0 inputs. The cost to change at index `v` is not less than the cost to pass at index `v`**

In natural language, the output state is: The total cost has been updated by adding the cost to pass at index `v` from the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. The other variables remain unchanged, except for the best cost, which is updated if the new total cost plus the cost to change at index `na_frente` is less than the current best cost. The input state remains the same, with no inputs in stdin.
