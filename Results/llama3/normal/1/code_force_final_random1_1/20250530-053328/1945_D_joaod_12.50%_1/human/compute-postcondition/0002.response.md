Output State: **cases is at least 1, c is 0, na_frente is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, total is 0, best is 10^12, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`, then reads two lists of integers from stdin and assigns them to `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. After that, it decrements `na_frente` and `pos_final` by 1. The last three lines initialize `total` to 0, `best` to 10^12, and do not affect any other variables. Since `cases` and `c` are not modified by the code, their values remain the same. Stdin is empty after the code execution.
