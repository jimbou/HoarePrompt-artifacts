Output State: **cases is at least 2, c is 2, na_frente is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, total is 0, best is 10^12, and stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `cases` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `c` also remains the same, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `na_frente` is decremented by 1, making it equal to its original value minus 3. Similarly, the value of `pos_final` is also decremented by 1, making it equal to its original value minus 3. The lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are assigned new values from the input, but their lengths and contents are not specified. The variable `total` is reset to 0, and the variable `best` is set to a large value (10^12). Finally, the stdin is empty as all inputs have been consumed by the code.
