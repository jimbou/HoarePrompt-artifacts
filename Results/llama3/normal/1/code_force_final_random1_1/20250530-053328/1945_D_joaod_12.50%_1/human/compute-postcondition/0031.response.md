Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is the original value of `total` plus the minimum of the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_passar_b` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, otherwise `total` is increased by the cost to either change a or pass b at position `v` depending on which cost is lower, `best` is `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `v` is the previous value of `na_frente`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of cases is at least 1, the variable c is 0, the variable na_frente is an integer that is one less than its original value and is greater than or equal to 0, the variable pos_final is an integer that is one less than its original value, the lists custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b remain unchanged, the variable total has been updated to include the minimum cost of either changing a or passing b at the position v, and the variable best has been updated to be the sum of the total cost and the cost of changing a at position v. The variable v remains the same as the previous value of na_frente.
