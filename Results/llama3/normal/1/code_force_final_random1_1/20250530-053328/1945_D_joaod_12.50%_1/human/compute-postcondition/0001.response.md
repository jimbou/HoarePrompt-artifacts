To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `c` and `cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cases` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `cases` is at least 1. The variable `c` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to `c` is 0.

State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0**
