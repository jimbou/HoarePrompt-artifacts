Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, and stdin contains -2 inputs. Additionally, `v` is greater than `pos_final`. If the cost to change at position `v` is less than the cost to pass at position `v`, then `total` is equal to the cost to change at position `v`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the cost to pass at position `v`.***
