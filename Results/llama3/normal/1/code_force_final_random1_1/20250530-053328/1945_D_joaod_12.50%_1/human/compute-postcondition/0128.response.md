Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, and two lists of n integers each. It then calculates the minimum cost to move from the first position to the final position, considering the costs of swapping and passing at each position. The function prints the minimum cost for each test case.**
