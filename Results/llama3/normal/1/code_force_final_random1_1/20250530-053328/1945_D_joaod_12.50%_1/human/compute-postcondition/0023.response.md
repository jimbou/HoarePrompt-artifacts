Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is the original value of `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `best` is either its original value or `total` plus the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` if the latter is greater, and `v` is -1, and stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been increased by the cost to change a at position `v`, which is the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `v` is -1, indicating that it is not a valid index for the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.
