Output State: **`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is the sum of its original value and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `v` is `na_frente`, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `best` is greater than the sum of the updated `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the sum of the updated `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. The current value of the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the current value of the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_passar_b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The total cost has been updated by adding the cost of switching at the current position `v`, which is the same as `na_frente`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `best` and the comparison between the costs of switching and passing at position `v` are still valid.
