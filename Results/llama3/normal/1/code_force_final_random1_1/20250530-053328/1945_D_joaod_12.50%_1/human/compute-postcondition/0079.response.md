Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`, and stdin contains -2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the first element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b` to it. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains -2 inputs.
