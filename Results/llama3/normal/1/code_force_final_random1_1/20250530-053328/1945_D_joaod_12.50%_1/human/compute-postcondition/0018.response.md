Postcondition: **cases is at least 1, c is 0, na_frente is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, total is increased by the cost to either change a or pass b at position v depending on which cost is lower, best is 10^12, stdin contains 0 inputs, v is na_frente, and v is greater than pos_final. The cost to change a at position v is compared to the cost to pass b at position v, and the lower cost is added to total.**
