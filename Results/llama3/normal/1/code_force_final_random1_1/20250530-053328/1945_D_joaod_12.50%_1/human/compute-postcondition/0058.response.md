Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is 0, `best` is 10^12, `v` is `na_frente`, and stdin contains -2 inputs. Additionally, `v` is greater than `pos_final`. The cost to change at position `v` is not less than the cost to pass at position `v`***
