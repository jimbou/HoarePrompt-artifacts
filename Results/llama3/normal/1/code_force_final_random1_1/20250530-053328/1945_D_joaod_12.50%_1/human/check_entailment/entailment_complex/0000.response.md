Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input data for each test case, including the number of people in the queue (n), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m), and the two lists of integers representing the costs of swapping and passing at each position.

2. The program initializes the necessary variables, including the total cost (total) and the best cost (best), which is initially set to a large value.

3. The program then iterates over the positions in the queue from the end to the beginning (i.e., from na_frente to 0). For each position, it checks if the current position is within the allowed final position (pos_final). If it is, the program updates the best cost if the current cost (total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]) is less than the current best cost.

4. The program also updates the total cost by adding the minimum of the cost of swapping (custo_pra_trocar_a[v]) and the cost of passing (custo_pra_passar_b[v]) at the current position.

5. After iterating over all positions, the program prints the best cost, which represents the minimum cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to a position within the allowed final position.

6. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the number of people in the queue is 1 or when the maximum allowable final position is 1.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
