Output State: **cases is at least 1, c is 1, na_frente is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, pos_final is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, total is 0, best is 10^12, and stdin contains -2 inputs.**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`, respectively. This reduces the number of inputs in stdin by 2. Then, it reads two lists of integers from stdin and assigns them to `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, respectively. This further reduces the number of inputs in stdin by 2. The next two lines decrement `na_frente` and `pos_final` by 1. The following two lines reset `total` to 0 and `best` to 10^12. The initial values of `cases` and `c` are not affected by the code.
