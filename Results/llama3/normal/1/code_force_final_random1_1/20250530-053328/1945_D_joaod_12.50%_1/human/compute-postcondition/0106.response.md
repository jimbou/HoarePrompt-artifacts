Postcondition: ***`cases` is at least 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3 and is at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer equal to its original value minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `v` is -1. If `best` is greater than `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`.***
