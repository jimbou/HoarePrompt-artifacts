Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs**

In this output state, the value of `n_cases` remains greater than 0, and the value of `i` remains 0. The variable `n` is assigned an integer value from the input. Since `n_cases` inputs are expected, and one input has been consumed to assign a value to `n`, there are `n_cases - 1` inputs remaining in the stdin.
