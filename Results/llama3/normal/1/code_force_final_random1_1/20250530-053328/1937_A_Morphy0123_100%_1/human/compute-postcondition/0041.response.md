Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 2^n, `i` is 1, `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3, `power` is not equal to `n` and is one less than its previous value, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been decremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `n_cases` and `n` is still valid, and `i` remains 1. The `stdin` still contains `n_cases` - 3 inputs.
