Output State: **n_cases is greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer equal to log2(n), power is equal to n, stdin contains n_cases - 1 inputs.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n_cases` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 0, `n` remains an integer equal to `log2(n)`, `power` is equal to `n`, and stdin still contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.
