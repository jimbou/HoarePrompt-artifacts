The code prints the result of the expression 2 ** power, where power is equal to n. Since n is the base-2 logarithm of its original integer value, we can rewrite the expression as 2 ** (base-2 logarithm of its original integer value). This simplifies to the original integer value itself.

Output: **the original integer value**
