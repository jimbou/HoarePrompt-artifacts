Output State: **n_cases is greater than 0, i is 2, n is the base-2 logarithm of its original integer value, power is equal to n, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The number of cases is still greater than 0, the value of i remains 2, the value of n is still the base-2 logarithm of its original integer value, the power is now equal to n (since the loop continues until power is no longer less than n), and the standard input remains empty.
