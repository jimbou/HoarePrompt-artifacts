The code increments the value of `power` by 1. The initial state has `power` equal to 1, so after the increment, `power` will be 2.

The other variables are not affected by this code, so their values remain the same: `n_cases` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, and `n` is still an integer equal to `log2(n)` and greater than 1.

The stdin still contains `n_cases - 1` inputs, as the code does not interact with the input.

Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to `log2(n)` and greater than 1, `power` is 2, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.**
