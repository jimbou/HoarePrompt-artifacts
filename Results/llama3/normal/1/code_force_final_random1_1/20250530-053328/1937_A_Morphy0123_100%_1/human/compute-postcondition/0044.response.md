Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is greater than 2^n, `i` is 1, `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3. If the current value of `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is being printed, where `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3. Otherwise, `power` is one less than its previous value and 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed. In both cases, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 inputs.***
