Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases` lines of input, each containing a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n_cases):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        power = 1
        n = log2(n)
        while power < n:
            power += 1
        if power == n:
            print(2 ** power)
        else:
            power -= 1
            print(2 ** power)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs. If `n` equals 1, then 1 is printed. Otherwise, `n` equals the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases - 1`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed, which is equal to 2. If the current value of power is not equal to `n`, then the value of 2 raised to the power of power is printed and power is one less than its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs. If `n` equals 1, then 1 is printed. Otherwise, `n` equals the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases - 3`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed, which is equal to 2. If the current value of power is not equal to `n`, then the value of 2 raised to the power of power is printed and power is one less than its previous value. If `n_cases` is greater than 2^n, `i` is 1, `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3. If the current value of `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is being printed, where `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3. Otherwise, `power` is one less than its previous value and 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed. In both cases, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer from stdin, stdin contains `n_cases - 5` inputs. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original integer value, power is either equal to `n` or one less than its original value and not equal to `n`, stdin is empty, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` or power is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
