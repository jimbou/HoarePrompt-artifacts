State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, stdin contains `n_cases - 2` inputs. If `n` equals 1, then 1 is printed. Otherwise, `n` equals the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases - 2`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed, which is equal to 2. If the current value of power is not equal to `n`, then the value of 2 raised to the power of power is printed and power is one less than its previous value.**
