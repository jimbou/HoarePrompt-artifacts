The first line assigns the value of 1 to `power`. The second line assigns the base-2 logarithm of `n` to `n`. Since `n` was an integer from stdin, stdin is now empty. The value of `n_cases` and `i` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **n_cases is greater than 0, i is 2, n is the base-2 logarithm of its original integer value, power is 1, stdin is empty**
