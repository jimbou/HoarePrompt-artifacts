The code prints the result of the expression 2 ** power, where power is an integer that is one less than its previous value and is not equal to n. Since the exact value of power is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of 2 ** power. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.
Output: **2 ** power (where power is an integer that is one less than its previous value and is not equal to n)**
