Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to `log2(n)` and greater than 3, `power` is 4, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `power` being 4. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.
