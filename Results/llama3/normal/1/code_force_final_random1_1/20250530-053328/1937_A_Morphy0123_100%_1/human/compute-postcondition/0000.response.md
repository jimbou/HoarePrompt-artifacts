The code `n_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`. Since the initial state specifies that the first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), representing the number of test cases, the value of `n_cases` will be equal to `t`.

The input is consumed one line at a time, so after reading the first line, the remaining input will contain `t` lines, each with a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9).

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases` lines of input, each containing a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9)**
