The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 3, `n` is greater than 2. `n` being greater than 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `power` is 3, `stdin` is empty**
