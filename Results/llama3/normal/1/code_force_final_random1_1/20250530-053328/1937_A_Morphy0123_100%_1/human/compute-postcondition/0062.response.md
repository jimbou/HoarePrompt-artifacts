Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original integer value, `power` is one less than its original value and is not equal to `n`, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been decremented by 1, but its relationship with `n` remains unchanged, i.e., `power` is still not equal to `n`. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin remains empty.
