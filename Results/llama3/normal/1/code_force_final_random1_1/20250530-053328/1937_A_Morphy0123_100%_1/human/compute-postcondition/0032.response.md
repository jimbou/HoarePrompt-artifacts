Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 7, `i` is 1, `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3, `power` is 3, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `power` being 3. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, `n`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
