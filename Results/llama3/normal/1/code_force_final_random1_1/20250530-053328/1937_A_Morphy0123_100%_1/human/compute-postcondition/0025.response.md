Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs. If `n` equals 1, then 1 is printed. Otherwise, `n` equals the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases - 3`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed, which is equal to 2. If the current value of power is not equal to `n`, then the value of 2 raised to the power of power is printed and power is one less than its previous value.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer input from stdin, and the number of inputs in stdin has decreased by 1. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
