Output State: **n_cases is greater than 0, i is 1, n is the logarithm base 2 of n_cases - 3, power is 1, stdin contains n_cases - 3 inputs.**

The code assigns the value of 1 to power, and assigns the logarithm base 2 of n_cases - 3 to n. No other variables are affected. The value of n_cases, i, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
