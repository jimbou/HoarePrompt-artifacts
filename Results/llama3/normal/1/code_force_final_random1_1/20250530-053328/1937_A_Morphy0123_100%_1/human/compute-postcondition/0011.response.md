The value of `power` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `power` was 2, so the new value of `power` is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to `log2(n)` and greater than 2, `power` is 3, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.

Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to `log2(n)` and greater than 2, `power` is 3, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.**
