The only variable in the loop head is variable power and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables power and n. If power is less than n, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, power is 1 and n is an integer and equal to log2(n). n being an integer and equal to log2(n) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to n must be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n_cases is greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, equal to log2(n) and must be greater than 1, power is 1, stdin contains n_cases - 1 inputs**
