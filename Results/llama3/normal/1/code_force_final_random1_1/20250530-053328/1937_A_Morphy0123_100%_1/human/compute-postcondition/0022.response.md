Postcondition: ***n_cases is greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer equal to log2(n_cases - 1), power is equal to n. If the current value of power is equal to n, then the value of 2 raised to the power of n which is equal to 2. Otherwise, the value of 2 raised to the power of power is being printed and power is one less than its previous value.***
