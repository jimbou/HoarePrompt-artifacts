Output: **`n_cases` is greater than 2^n, `i` is 1, `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3, `power` is `n`. The current value of `power` is equal to `n`. `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 inputs, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is being printed, where `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3**
