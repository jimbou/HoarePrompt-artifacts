According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `power` is 1 and `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3, `n_cases` - 3 must be greater than 2 (because 2^1 = 2 and 2^2 = 4), which means `n_cases` must be greater than 5.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 5, `i` is 1, `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3, `power` is 1, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 inputs**
