The variable in the loop head is variable power and n, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables power and n. If power is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, power is 3, n is an integer equal to log2(n) and greater than 2. n being greater than 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to n is greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to `log2(n)` and greater than 3, `power` is 3, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs**
