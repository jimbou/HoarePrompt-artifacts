The value of `power` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `power` was 3, so the new value of `power` is 4. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n_cases` is greater than 2^6, `i` is 1, `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3, `power` is 4, and `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 inputs.
