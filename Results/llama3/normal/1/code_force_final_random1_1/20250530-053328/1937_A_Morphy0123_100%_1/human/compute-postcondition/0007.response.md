Output State: **n_cases is greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer and equal to log2(n), power is 1, stdin contains n_cases - 1 inputs**

The code consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value 1 to the variable `power`. The second line assigns the value of `log2(n)` to the variable `n`. Since `n` was initially an integer and not equal to 1, `log2(n)` will also be an integer. The values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged. Stdin still contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.
