#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9), representing the length of the array a.
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: `n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n_cases`, `n` is an integer from stdin, stdin is empty. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original integer value, power is either equal to `n` or one less than its original value and not equal to `n`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` or power is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case is an integer representing the length of an array. For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the given length. If the length is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the base-2 logarithm of the length and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the original length. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.
