The code accepts an input and converts it to an integer, then assigns it to `n`. The stdin contains `n_cases - 4` inputs, and one of them is accepted and converted to an integer. The values of `n_cases` and `i` are not affected.

Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer from stdin, stdin contains `n_cases - 5` inputs.**
