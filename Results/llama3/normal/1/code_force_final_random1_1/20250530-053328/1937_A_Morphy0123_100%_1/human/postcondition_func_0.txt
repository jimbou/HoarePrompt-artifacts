The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case is an integer representing the length of an array. For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the given length. If the length is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the base-2 logarithm of the length and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the original length. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.
