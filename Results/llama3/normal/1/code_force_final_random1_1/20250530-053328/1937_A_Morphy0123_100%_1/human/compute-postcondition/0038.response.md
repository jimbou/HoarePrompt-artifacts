The code prints the result of the expression `2 ** power`, where `power` is equal to `n`. Since `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3, we can rewrite the expression as `2 ** (log2(n_cases - 3))`.

Using the property of logarithms that `a ** (loga(x)) = x`, we can simplify the expression to `n_cases - 3`.

Therefore, the code prints the value of `n_cases` minus 3.

Output: **n_cases - 3**
