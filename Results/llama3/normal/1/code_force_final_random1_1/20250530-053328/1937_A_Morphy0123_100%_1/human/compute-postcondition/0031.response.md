The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. Since `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3, we need to ensure that `n_cases` - 3 is greater than 2^2, which means `n_cases` must be greater than 2^2 + 3 = 7.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 7, `i` is 1, `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3, `power` is 2, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 inputs**
