The code prints the result of the expression `2 ** power`, where `power` is one less than its original value and is not equal to `n`. Since `power` is not equal to `n`, we can't determine the exact value of `power`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression `2 ** power`.
Output: **2 raised to the power of (one less than the original value of power)**
