Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer from stdin, stdin contains `n_cases - 5` inputs. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. Otherwise, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original integer value, power is either equal to `n` or one less than its original value and not equal to `n`, stdin is empty, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` or power is being printed.***
