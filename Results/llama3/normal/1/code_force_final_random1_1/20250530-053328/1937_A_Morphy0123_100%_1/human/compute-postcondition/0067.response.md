Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n_cases`, `n` is an integer from stdin, stdin is empty. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original integer value, power is either equal to `n` or one less than its original value and not equal to `n`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` or power is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the number of cases `n_cases`, and the input stream `stdin` will be empty. The value of `n` will be the base-2 logarithm of its original integer value. If `n` is 1, the number 1 will be printed. Otherwise, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` or `power` will be printed, where `power` is either equal to `n` or one less than its original value and not equal to `n`.
