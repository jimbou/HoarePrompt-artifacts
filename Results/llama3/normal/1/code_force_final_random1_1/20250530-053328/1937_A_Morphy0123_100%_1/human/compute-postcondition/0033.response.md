According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 3, `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3. `n_cases` being greater than 7 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n_cases` is greater than 2^6. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n_cases` is greater than 2^6, `i` is 1, `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3, `power` is 3, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 inputs**
