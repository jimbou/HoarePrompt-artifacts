Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to log2(n), `power` is not equal to n and is one less than its previous value, stdin contains n_cases - 1 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been decremented by 1, but it is still not equal to `n`. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.
