Output State: `n_cases` is greater than 2^n, `i` is 1, `n` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3, `power` is the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 2, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 inputs.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n_cases` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` remains 1, `n` remains the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 3, `power` becomes the logarithm base 2 of `n_cases` - 2, and `stdin` still contains `n_cases` - 3 inputs.
