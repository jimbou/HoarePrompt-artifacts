Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 1, l is a list containing m elements, p is a list containing m+1 elements, c is a list containing m+1 elements, stdin contains t - n - m - 3 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c, j is the count of 1's in list l, _ is 1.**

The code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. It then calculates the differences between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of lists `c` and `p`, and assigns these differences to variables `i` and `s`, respectively. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `j`, and `_` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in the standard input decreases by 2.
