The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, m is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again _ must be 1 and m must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 1, l is a list containing m elements, p is a list containing m+1 elements, c is a list containing m+1 elements, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c, j is the count of 1's in list l, _ is 1, and x is the last element in the list.**
