Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list containing `m` elements that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list containing `a` elements, `c` is a list containing `a+1` elements, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the difference between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of list `p`, `i` is the difference between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of list `c` plus the first element in the list plus `x`, `j` is the count of 1's in list `l` plus 1 if the first element of list `l` is 1, otherwise `j` is the count of 1's in list `l` plus 1 if the second element in the list is 1, otherwise `j` is the count of 1's in list `l`. If `x` is 1, `j` is the count of 1's in list `l` plus 2 if the first element of list `l` is 1, otherwise `j` is the count of 1's in list `l` plus 2 if the second element in the list is 1, otherwise `j` is the count of 1's in list `l` plus 1. `x` is the third element in `l`.***
