Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, l is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 1 element, p is a list containing a single element 0, c is a list containing a single element 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases. If the first element in the list is 1, then i is 0 and j is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
