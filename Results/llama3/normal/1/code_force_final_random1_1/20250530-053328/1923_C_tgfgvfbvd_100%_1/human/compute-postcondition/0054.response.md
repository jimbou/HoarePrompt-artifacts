Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list containing at least 2 elements, p is a list containing at least 4 elements, c is a list containing at least 4 elements, stdin contains t - n - m - 1 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is either its original value incremented by x or x, j is either 1 or 2 or its original value incremented by 1 if x is not 1, otherwise j is 2, x is the third element of list l.**

The code snippet modifies the values of variables `i`, `p`, and `c`. The first line increments the value of `i` by the value of `x`, which is the third element of list `l`. The second line appends the new value of `i` to list `p`, increasing its length by 1. The third line appends the value of `j` to list `c`, also increasing its length by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `x`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
