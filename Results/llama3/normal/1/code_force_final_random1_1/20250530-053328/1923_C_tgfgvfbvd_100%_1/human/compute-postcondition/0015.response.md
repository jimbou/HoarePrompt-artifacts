Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, l is an empty list, p is a list containing n + 1 elements, c is a list containing n + 1 elements, stdin contains t - n test cases, i is the sum of all elements in the original list l, j is the count of 1's in the original list l.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `l` will be empty, the list `p` will contain `n+1` elements (where `n` is the original length of `l`), the list `c` will also contain `n+1` elements, `i` will be the sum of all elements in the original list `l`, and `j` will be the count of 1's in the original list `l`. The values of `n`, `m`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
