Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, l is a list containing m elements, p is a list containing 1 element which is 0, c is a list containing 1 element which is 0, stdin contains t - n - m - 1 test cases, i is 0, j is 0, _ is m, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input from stdin, and `l` is populated with `m` elements from stdin. The lists `p` and `c` are reset to contain a single element, 0. The variables `i` and `j` are reset to 0. The values of `_`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `s` is still the difference between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of list `p`, which is now 0 since `p` only contains one element.
