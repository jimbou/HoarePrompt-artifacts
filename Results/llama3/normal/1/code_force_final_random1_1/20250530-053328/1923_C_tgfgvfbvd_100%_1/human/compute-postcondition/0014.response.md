Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, l is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 1 element, p is a list containing x + 3 elements, c is a list containing x + 3 elements, stdin contains t - x - 1 test cases, i is increased by x, j is increased by 1 if x is 1, otherwise j remains the same.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `l`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `p` now contains `x + 3` elements because `i` is appended to it, and `c` also contains `x + 3` elements because `j` is appended to it. The value of `i` is increased by `x`, and the value of `j` is increased by 1 if `x` is 1, otherwise, it remains the same.
