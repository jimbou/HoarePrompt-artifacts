Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program initializes two lists, `p` and `c`, to keep track of the prefix sums of the array `l` and the count of 1's in the array, respectively.

2. It then iterates over the array `l` and updates the `p` and `c` lists accordingly. If an element is 1, it increments the count of 1's in `c`.

3. For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray (`s`) and the count of 1's in the subarray (`i`) by subtracting the corresponding prefix sums.

4. It then checks if the subarray is good by verifying the conditions:
   - `b - a + 1 > 1`: This ensures that the subarray has more than one element.
   - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`: This checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements is greater than or equal to the count of 1's. This is because each 1 in the subarray needs to be replaced with a number greater than 1, and the remaining sum should be sufficient to do so.

5. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', indicating that the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
