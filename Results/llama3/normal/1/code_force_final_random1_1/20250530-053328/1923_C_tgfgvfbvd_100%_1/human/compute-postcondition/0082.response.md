Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list containing m elements, p is a list containing 1 element, c is a list containing 1 element, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c, j is the count of 1's in list l, _ is m - 2**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, and the value of `m` is an integer greater than 0. The list `l` contains `m` elements. The lists `p` and `c` each contain 1 element, which is 0. The standard input `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases. The values of `a` and `b` are integers. The value of `s` is the difference between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of list `p`, and the value of `i` is the difference between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of list `c`. The value of `j` is the count of 1's in list `l`. The value of `_` is `m - 2`.
