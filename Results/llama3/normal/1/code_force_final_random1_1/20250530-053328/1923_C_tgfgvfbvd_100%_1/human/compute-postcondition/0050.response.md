Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list containing at least 1 element, p is a list containing at least 3 elements, c is a list containing at least 3 elements, stdin contains t - n - m - 1 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is either its original value incremented by x or x, j is either 1 or 2 or its original value incremented by 1, x is the second element of list l. If x equals 1, j is 2, otherwise j is either 1 or its original value incremented by 1.**

In this final state, the value of `i` has been incremented by `x`, which is the second element of list `l`. The list `p` now contains an additional element, which is the new value of `i`. The list `c` also contains an additional element, which is the new value of `j`. The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, unless `x` equals 1, in which case `j` is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
