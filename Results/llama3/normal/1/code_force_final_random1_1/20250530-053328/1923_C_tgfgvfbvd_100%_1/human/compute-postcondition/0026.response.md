Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, l is an empty list, p is a list containing n + 1 elements, c is a list containing n + 1 elements, stdin contains t - n - 2 test cases, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c, j is the count of 1's in the original list l, _ is 1, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p.**

The code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `a` and `b`, and then calculates the differences between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of lists `c` and `p`, assigning these differences to `i` and `s`, respectively. The value of `j` remains unchanged as the list `l` is not modified. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.
