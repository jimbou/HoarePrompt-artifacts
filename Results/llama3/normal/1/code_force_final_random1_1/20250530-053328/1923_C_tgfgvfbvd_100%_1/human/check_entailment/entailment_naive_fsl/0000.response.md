Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly determines whether a subarray is good or not based on the conditions provided.

The program first calculates the prefix sum and the count of 1's in the array. Then, for each query, it checks if the subarray is good by verifying the conditions:

1. The sum of the subarray is equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray in the prefix sum array.
2. The number of 1's in the subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray.

If both conditions are met, the program prints "YES", indicating that the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including edge cases such as a subarray of length 1, a subarray with all 1's, and a subarray with a mix of 1's and other numbers.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
