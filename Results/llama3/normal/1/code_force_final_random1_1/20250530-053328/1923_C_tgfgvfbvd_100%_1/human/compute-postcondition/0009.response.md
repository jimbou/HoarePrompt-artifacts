Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing `x + 1` elements, `c` is a list containing `x + 1` elements, `stdin` contains `t - x - 1` test cases, `x` is the next element in the list `l`. If `x` is 1, `j` is increased by 1.***
