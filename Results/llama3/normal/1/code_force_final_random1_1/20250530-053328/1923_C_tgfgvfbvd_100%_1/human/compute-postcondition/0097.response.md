To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than 0. Since `_` is the loop variable, it will take values from 0 to `m-1`. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `_` to be 0, which is the initial value it will take before the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list containing `m` elements, `p` is a list containing `m+1` elements, `c` is a list containing `m+1` elements, `stdin` contains `t - 2` test cases, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the difference between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of list `p`, `i` is the difference between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of list `c` plus the sum of all elements in list `l`, `j` is the count of 1's in list `l`, `_` is 0, and `x` is the last element in the list.**
