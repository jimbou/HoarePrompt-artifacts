The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the value returned by int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is m - 1. For the loop to execute again, _ must be m - 1 + 1 = m and the value returned by int(input()) must be greater than m.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, l is an empty list, p is a list containing n + 1 elements, c is a list containing n + 1 elements, stdin contains t - n - m - 1 test cases, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c, j is the count of 1's in the original list l, _ is m, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p**
