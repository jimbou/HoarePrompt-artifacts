Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list containing m elements, p is a list containing m+1 elements, c is a list containing m+1 elements, stdin contains t - n - m - 2 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c, j is the count of 1's in list l, _ is 0**

The code snippet reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to `a` and `b`. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The second line calculates the difference between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of list `c` and assigns it to `i`. The third line calculates the difference between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of list `p` and assigns it to `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `j`, and `_` remain unchanged.
