Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, l is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 1 element, p is a list containing x + 1 elements, c is a list containing x + 1 elements, stdin contains t - x - 1 test cases. If the first element in the list is 1, then i is x and j is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**

The code executes x times, where x is the number of test cases minus 1. In each iteration, the value of i is incremented by 1, and this new value is appended to list p. Similarly, the value of j is appended to list c. The initial values of i and j are 0 and 1 respectively if the first element in the list is 1; otherwise, they remain unchanged. After x iterations, list p will contain x + 1 elements (including the initial 0), and list c will also contain x + 1 elements (including the initial 0). The stdin will be left with t - x - 1 test cases.
