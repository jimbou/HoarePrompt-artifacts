Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, l is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, p is a list containing a single element 0, c is a list containing a single element 0, i is 0, j is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases**.

Here's a breakdown of how the code affects the initial state:

- The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. Since `n` and `m` are between 1 and 3 * 10^5, they are now integers within this range.

- The second line reads `n` integers from stdin and assigns them to the list `l`. Since each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `l` is now a list of `n` integers within this range.

- The third line initializes the list `p` with a single element 0.

- The fourth line initializes the list `c` with a single element 0.

- The fifth line initializes the variables `i` and `j` to 0.

- The code does not modify the value of `t` or the remaining test cases in stdin. Since one test case has been processed, there are now `t - 1` test cases left in stdin.
