Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `l` is a list of n-1 integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing x + 2 elements, `c` is a list containing x + 2 elements, `stdin` contains t - x - 1 test cases, `x` is the next element in the list `l`, `i` is increased by x, if `x` is 1, `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` is not increased.***
