Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list containing m elements that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing a-1 elements, c is a list containing a elements, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c plus the first element in the list, j is the count of 1's in list l plus 1 if the first element of list l is 1, otherwise j is the count of 1's in list l. If the second element in the list is 1, then j is the count of 1's in list l plus 2 if the first element of list l is 1, otherwise j is the count of 1's in list l plus 1.***
