The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, m is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again m must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 2, l is a list containing m elements, p is a list containing m+1 elements, c is a list containing m+1 elements, stdin contains t - n - m - 3 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c, j is the count of 1's in list l, _ is 2. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
