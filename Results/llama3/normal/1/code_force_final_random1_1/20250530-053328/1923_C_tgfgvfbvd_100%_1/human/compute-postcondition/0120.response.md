Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list containing m elements, p is a list containing m+1 elements, c is a list containing m+1 elements, stdin contains t - (m + 2) test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c, j is the count of 1's in list l, _ is m - 1, and x is the last element in the list. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

The loop will execute until the value of `_` reaches `m - 1`, at which point the loop will terminate. At this point, the values of `a`, `b`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `x` will be the same as they were after the last iteration of the loop. The value of `_` will be `m - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `m` times. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body, such as `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `stdin`, will remain unchanged.
