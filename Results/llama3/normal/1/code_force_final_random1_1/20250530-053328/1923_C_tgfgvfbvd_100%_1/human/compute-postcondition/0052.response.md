Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `c` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains `t - n - m - 1` test cases, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the difference between the `b`th and (`a-1`)th elements of list `p`, `i` is either its original value incremented by `x` or `x`, `j` is either 2 or 3 or its original value incremented by 2, `x` is the third element of list `l`. If `x` equals 1, `j` is 3, otherwise `j` is either 2 or its original value incremented by 2**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1. If `x` equals 1, `j` is now 3. Otherwise, `j` is either 2 or its original value incremented by 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
