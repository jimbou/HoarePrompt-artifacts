Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list containing at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing 1 element which is 0, `c` is a list containing 1 element which is 0, `stdin` contains `t - n - m - 1` test cases, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `_` is `m`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the difference between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of list `p`, `x` is the first element of list `l` and equals 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains at least one element, and its first element `x` is still 1. The lists `p` and `c` still contain a single element, which is 0. The value of `n` is still between 1 and 3 * 10^5, and the value of `m` is still greater than 0. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same. The values of `i`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `s` are also unchanged.
