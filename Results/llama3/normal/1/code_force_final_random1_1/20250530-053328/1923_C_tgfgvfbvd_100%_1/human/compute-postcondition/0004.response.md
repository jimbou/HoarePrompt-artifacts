Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, l is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 1 element, p is a list containing a single element 0, c is a list containing a single element 0, i is 0, j is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, x is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of j has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including n, m, l, p, c, i, and x. The stdin still contains t - 1 test cases.
