Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, l is an empty list, p is a list containing n + 1 elements, c is a list containing n + 1 elements, stdin contains t - n - 2 test cases, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c, j is the count of 1's in the original list l, _ is 2, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
