Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, l is an empty list, p is a list containing n + 1 elements, c is a list containing n + 1 elements, stdin contains t - n - 2 test cases, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c, j is the count of 1's in the original list l, _ is 2, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p**

The code block reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to `a` and `b`. The first line does not affect any variables. The second line assigns the difference between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of list `c` to `i`. The third line assigns the difference between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of list `p` to `s`. No other variables are affected.
