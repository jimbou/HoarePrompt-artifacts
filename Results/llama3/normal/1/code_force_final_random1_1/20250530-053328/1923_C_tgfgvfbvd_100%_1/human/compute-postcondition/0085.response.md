Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list containing `m` elements that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing 1 element, `c` is a list containing 1 element, stdin contains `t - 2` test cases, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the difference between the `b`th and (`a-1`)th elements of list `p`, `i` is the difference between the `b`th and (`a-1`)th elements of list `c`, `j` is the count of 1's in list `l` plus 1, `_` is `m - 2`, `x` is 1, which is also the first element in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, indicating that the count of 1's in list `l` has increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
