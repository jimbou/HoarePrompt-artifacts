This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on certain conditions. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function's purpose is to determine whether a given condition is met for each test case and print the corresponding result. The final state of the program is that stdin is empty, and the function has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
