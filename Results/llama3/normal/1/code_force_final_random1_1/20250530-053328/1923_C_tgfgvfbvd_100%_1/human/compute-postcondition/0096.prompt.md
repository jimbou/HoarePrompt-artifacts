Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list containing m elements, p is a list containing 1 element, c is a list containing 1 element, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c, j is the count of 1's in list l, _ is m - 2
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list containing m elements that must have at least 1 element, p is a list containing a-1 elements, c is a list containing a elements, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c plus the first element in the list, j is the count of 1's in list l plus 1 if the first element of list l is 1, otherwise j is the count of 1's in list l, _ is m - 2, and x is the first element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list containing m elements that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing a elements, c is a list containing a+1 elements, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c plus the first element in the list plus x, j is the count of 1's in list l plus 1 if the first element of list l is 1, otherwise j is the count of 1's in list l plus 1 if the second element in the list is 1, otherwise j is the count of 1's in list l.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list containing m elements that must have at least 3 elements, p is a list containing a+1 elements, c is a list containing a+2 elements, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c plus the first element in the list plus x plus x, j is the count of 1's in list l plus 1 if the first element of list l is 1, otherwise j is the count of 1's in list l plus 1 if the second element in the list is 1, otherwise j is the count of 1's in list l. If x is 1, j is the count of 1's in list l plus 2 if the first element of list l is 1, otherwise j is the count of 1's in list l plus 2 if the second element in the list is 1, otherwise j is the count of 1's in list l plus 1. x is the third element in l.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
