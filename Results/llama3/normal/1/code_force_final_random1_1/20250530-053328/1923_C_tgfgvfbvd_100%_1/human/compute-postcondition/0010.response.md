Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, l is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing x + 2 elements, c is a list containing x + 2 elements, stdin contains t - x - 1 test cases, x is the next element in the list l, i is increased by x, j is increased by 1 if x is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `stdin`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `p` now contains `x + 2` elements, with the last element being the value of `i` after it has been increased by `x`. Similarly, the list `c` also contains `x + 2` elements, with the last element being the value of `j` after it has been increased by 1 if `x` is 1. The value of `i` is increased by `x`, and the value of `j` is increased by 1 if `x` is 1.
