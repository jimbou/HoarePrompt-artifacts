Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list containing at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing 1 element which is 0, `c` is a list containing 1 element which is 0, `stdin` contains `t - n - m - 1` test cases, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the difference between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of list `p`. If the first element of list `l` is 1, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `i` and `j` are unchanged.***
