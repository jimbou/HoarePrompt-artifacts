Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list containing at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `c` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains `t - n - m - 1` test cases, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the difference between the `b`th and (`a-1`)th elements of list `p`, `i` is either 0 or its original value incremented by `x`, `j` is either 2 or its original value incremented by 1, `x` is the second element of list `l`**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `j` can be either 2 (if its original value was 1) or its original value incremented by 1 (if its original value was not 1). The rest of the variables maintain their original values and properties.
