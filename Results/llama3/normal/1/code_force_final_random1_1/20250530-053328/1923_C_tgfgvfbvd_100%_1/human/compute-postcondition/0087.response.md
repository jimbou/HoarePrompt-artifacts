Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list containing m elements that must have at least 1 element, p is a list containing a-1 elements, c is a list containing a elements, stdin contains t - 2 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c plus the first element in the list, j is the count of 1's in list l plus 1 if the first element of list l is 1, otherwise j is the count of 1's in list l, _ is m - 2, and x is the first element in the list.**

The first line increments `i` by the value of `x`, which is the first element in the list. The second line appends the new value of `i` to the end of list `p`. The third line appends the value of `j` to the end of list `c`. No other variables are affected.
