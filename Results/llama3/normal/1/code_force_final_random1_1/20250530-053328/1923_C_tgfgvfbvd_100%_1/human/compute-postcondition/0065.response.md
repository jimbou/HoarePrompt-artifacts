Postcondition: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list containing m elements, p is a list containing m+1 elements, c is a list containing m+1 elements, stdin contains t - n - m - 2 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list c, j is the count of 1's in list l, _ is 0. If b - a + 1 is greater than 1 and s - (b - a + 1) is greater than or equal to i, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
