Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, m is an integer greater than 0, l is a list containing at least 1 element, p is a list containing at least 2 elements, the last element of p is i, c is a list containing at least 2 elements, the last element of c is j, stdin contains t - n - m - 1 test cases, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is the difference between the bth and (a-1)th elements of list p, i is either 0 or its original value incremented by x, j is either 1 or its original value.**

The code modifies the lists `p` and `c` by appending new elements to them. The value of `i` is incremented by `x` if the first element of list `l` is 1, and the value of `j` is set to 1 in this case. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` is also unchanged.
