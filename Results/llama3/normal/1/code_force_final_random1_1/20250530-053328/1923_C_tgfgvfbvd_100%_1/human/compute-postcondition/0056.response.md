To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a list containing `m` elements, `p` is a list containing `m+1` elements, `c` is a list containing `m+1` elements, `stdin` contains `t - n - m - 1` test cases, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is the difference between the `b`th and `(a-1)`th elements of list `p`, `i` is the sum of all elements in list `l`, `j` is the count of 1's in list `l`, `_` is 0**
