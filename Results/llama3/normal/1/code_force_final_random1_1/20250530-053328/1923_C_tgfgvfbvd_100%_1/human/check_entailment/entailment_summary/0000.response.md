Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray is "good" based on certain conditions. The program uses prefix sums and counts of ones to efficiently process queries.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input, including the number of test cases, the length of the array, the number of queries, the array elements, and the query ranges.
2.  It initializes the prefix sum array `p` and the count of ones array `c` correctly.
3.  The program iterates over the array elements, updating the prefix sum and count of ones arrays accordingly.
4.  For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray and the count of ones in the subarray using the prefix sum and count of ones arrays.
5.  The program applies the conditions to determine whether the subarray is "good":

    *   It checks if the length of the subarray is greater than 1 (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
    *   It checks if the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of ones in the subarray (`s - (b - a + 1) >= i`).
6.  Based on these conditions, the program prints 'YES' if the subarray is "good" and 'NO' otherwise.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently processes the input and queries using prefix sums and counts of ones.

Correctness: **True**
