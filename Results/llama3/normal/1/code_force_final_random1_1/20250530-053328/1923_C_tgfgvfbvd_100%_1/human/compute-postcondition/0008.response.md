Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `l` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing `x + 1` elements, `c` is a list containing `x + 1` elements, `stdin` contains `t - x - 1` test cases, `x` is the next element in the list `l`, `j` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, and `p` and `c` still contain `x + 1` elements each. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t - x - 1`, and `x` is still the next element in the list `l`.
