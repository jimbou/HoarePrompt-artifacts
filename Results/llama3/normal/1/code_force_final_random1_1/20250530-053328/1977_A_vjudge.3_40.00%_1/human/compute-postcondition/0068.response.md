Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, stdin is empty. If `n` equals `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` is greater than `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` equals `n-1`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, if both `m` and `n` are even integers or both are odd integers, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variables `n` and `m` will still be integers between 1 and 100, but the input stream (stdin) will be empty because all the input lines have been processed. The output will be a series of 'Yes' or 'No' messages, depending on the conditions specified in the loop body, which check for equality, greater-than, and parity of `n` and `m`.
