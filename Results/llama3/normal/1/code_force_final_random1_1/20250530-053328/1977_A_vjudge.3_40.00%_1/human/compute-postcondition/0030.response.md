The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers. If `n` is equal to `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `n` is not equal to `m`, then if `m` is greater than `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, then if `m` is equal to `n-1`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` is not equal to `n-1`, then if both `m` and `n` are even numbers or both are odd numbers, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
