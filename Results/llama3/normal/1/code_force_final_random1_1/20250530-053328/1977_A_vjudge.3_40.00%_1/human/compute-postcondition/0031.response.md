Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` and `m` are assigned the two integers from the input, stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the two integers read from the input. The stdin now contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers, since one line has been read and processed.
