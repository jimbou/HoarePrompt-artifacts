Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains `t-4` lines, each containing two integers. If both `m` and `n` are even integers, 'Yes' is printed. If both `m` and `n` are odd integers, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
