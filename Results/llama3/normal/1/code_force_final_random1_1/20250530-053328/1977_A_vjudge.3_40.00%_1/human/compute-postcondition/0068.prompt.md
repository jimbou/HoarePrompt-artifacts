Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if n == m:
        print('Yes')
    elif m > n:
        print('No')
    elif m == n - 1:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers. If `n` is equal to `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `n` is not equal to `m`, then if `m` is greater than `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, then if `m` is equal to `n-1`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` is not equal to `n-1`, then if both `m` and `n` are even numbers or both are odd numbers, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` and `m` are assigned the two integers from the input, stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers. If `n` equals `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` > `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` equals `n-1`, 'Yes' is printed. If both `n` and `m` are even or both are odd, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains `t-4` lines, each containing two integers. If `n` equals `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` is greater than `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` is equal to `n-1`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, if both `m` and `n` are even integers or both are odd integers, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
