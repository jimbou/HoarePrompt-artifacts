Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The conditions checked in the program are sufficient to cover all possible scenarios:

- If n equals m, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding one cube at a time.
- If m is one less than n, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding one cube at a time and then removing one cube.
- If both n and m are even or both are odd, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding or removing cubes in pairs.

The program correctly handles all these cases and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
