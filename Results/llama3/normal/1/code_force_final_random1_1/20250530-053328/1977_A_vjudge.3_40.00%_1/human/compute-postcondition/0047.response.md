Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` and `m` are assigned the two integers from the input, stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers. If `m` > `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` equals `n-1`, 'Yes' is printed. If both `n` and `m` are even or both are odd, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
