Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers. If `n` is equal to `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `n` is not equal to `m`, then if `m` is greater than `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, then if `m` is equal to `n-1`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` is not equal to `n-1`, then if both `m` and `n` are even numbers or both are odd numbers, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
