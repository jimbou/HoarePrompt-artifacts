Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking various conditions based on the values of n and m.

1. If n equals m, the program prints 'Yes', which is correct because Nikita can simply add one cube at a time to reach m cubes.

2. If m is greater than n, the program prints 'No', which is correct because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he makes.

3. If m equals n - 1, the program prints 'Yes', which is correct because Nikita can add one cube at a time and then remove one cube to reach m cubes.

4. If both m and n are even, the program prints 'Yes', which is correct because Nikita can add or remove two cubes at a time to reach m cubes.

5. If both m and n are odd, the program prints 'Yes', which is correct because Nikita can add or remove two cubes at a time and then add or remove one more cube to reach m cubes.

6. In all other cases, the program prints 'No'.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The conditions are not mutually exclusive, and the program does not consider all possible scenarios. For example, if n is odd and m is even, or vice versa, the program does not provide a correct solution.

Therefore, the given program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
