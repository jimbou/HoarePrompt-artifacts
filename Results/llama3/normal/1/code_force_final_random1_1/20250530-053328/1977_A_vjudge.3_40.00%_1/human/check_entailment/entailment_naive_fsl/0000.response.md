Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The key insight is that the number of cubes in the tower can be changed by 1 in each move, so the parity of the number of cubes (even or odd) can only be changed in each move. Therefore, if the number of moves n and the number of cubes m have the same parity (both even or both odd), it's possible to build a tower with m cubes.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* If n == m, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by putting 1 cube on top of the tower n times.
* If m > n, it's not possible to build a tower with m cubes because the number of cubes cannot exceed the number of moves.
* If m == n - 1, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by putting 1 cube on top of the tower n-1 times and then removing 1 cube.
* If m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes because the number of cubes and the number of moves have the same parity.
* If m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes because the number of cubes and the number of moves have the same parity.
* In all other cases, it's not possible to build a tower with m cubes.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs and produces the correct output for each case.
