Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking various conditions based on the values of n and m. However, the conditions checked are not sufficient to cover all possible scenarios.

For example, when m is less than n, the program only checks if m is equal to n-1 or if both m and n are even or odd. However, this does not account for cases where m is less than n-1. In such cases, it is still possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding and removing cubes in a specific sequence.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not cover all possible scenarios and may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
