The code reads a line from the input, splits it into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial state has `t` lines in the input, each containing two integers `n` and `m`. After executing the code, one line is read from the input, so `t-1` lines remain. The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers read from the input. The value of `i` is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers.**
