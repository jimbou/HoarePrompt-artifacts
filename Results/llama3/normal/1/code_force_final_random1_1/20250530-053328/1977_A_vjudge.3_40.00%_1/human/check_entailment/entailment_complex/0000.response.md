Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. The program checks the following conditions:

- If n equals m, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding one cube at a time.
- If m is greater than n, it's not possible to build a tower with m cubes because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time.
- If m equals n-1, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding one cube at a time and then removing one cube.
- If both n and m are even or both are odd, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes because Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs.

The program correctly handles all these conditions and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
