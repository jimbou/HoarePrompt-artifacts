Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and m. It then determines whether the numbers satisfy certain conditions and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly. The conditions are: if n equals m, if m is one less than n, or if both n and m are either even or odd integers. If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'No'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
