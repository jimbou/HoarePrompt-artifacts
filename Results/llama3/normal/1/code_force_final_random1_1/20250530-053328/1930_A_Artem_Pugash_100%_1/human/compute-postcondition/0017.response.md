The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (because the step in the range is 2), so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `2 * n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is at least twice the smallest integer in `l`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 4, and `_` is not defined**
