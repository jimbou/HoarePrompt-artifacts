Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `i` is equal to 2 * `n`, `_` is 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains an integer, `l` remains a sorted list of integers, and `score` is the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element. The `stdin` still contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, and `_` is still 1. The value of `i` is now equal to 2 * `n`, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
