To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is equal to 2 * n, we need to adjust `i` to be equal to 0, which is the starting value of the range. Additionally, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is 0, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 0, `_` is 1**
