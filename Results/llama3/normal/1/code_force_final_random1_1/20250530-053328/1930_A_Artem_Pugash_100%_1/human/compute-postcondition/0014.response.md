The code `score += l[i]` adds the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l` to the variable `score`. Since `l` is a sorted list of integers and `i` is 0, the value added to `score` is the smallest integer in the list `l`. The value of `score` is now equal to the smallest integer in the list `l`.

The values of the other variables are not affected. The variable `n` is still at least 1, `l` is still a sorted list of integers, `stdin` is still empty, and `i` is still 0. The variable `_` is still not defined.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the smallest integer in `l`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, and `_` is not defined.**
