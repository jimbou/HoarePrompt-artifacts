Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves on a whiteboard with 2n positive integers. The program works as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases (t) from the input and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers (n) and the 2n integers themselves.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4. It initializes a score variable to 0.
5. It then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2 (i.e., it considers every other element starting from the first one). For each pair of elements, it adds the smaller one to the score.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum final score that can be achieved.

The program's logic is correct because it takes advantage of the fact that the optimal strategy is to always choose the smallest two numbers on the whiteboard and add the smaller one to the score. By sorting the list of integers, the program can easily identify the smallest two numbers at each step and add the smaller one to the score.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for achieving the maximum final score.

Correctness: **True**
