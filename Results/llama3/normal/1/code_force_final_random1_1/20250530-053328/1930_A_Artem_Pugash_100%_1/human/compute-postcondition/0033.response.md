Output State: **`n` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to 2 * `n`, `_` is equal to `t`, and the score which is the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element is being printed**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be the last integer input, `l` will be the last sorted list of integers, `score` will be the sum of every other element in `l` starting from the first one, `stdin` will be empty because all inputs have been read, `i` will be equal to 2 times the last `n`, and `_` will be equal to `t` because the loop has executed `t` times. The final score, which is the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first one, will be printed as the output.
