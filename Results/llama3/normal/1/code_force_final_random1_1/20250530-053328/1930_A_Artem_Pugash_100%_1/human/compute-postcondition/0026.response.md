The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (because the step is 2), so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `2 * n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the first element of `l`, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 2, `_` is 1**
