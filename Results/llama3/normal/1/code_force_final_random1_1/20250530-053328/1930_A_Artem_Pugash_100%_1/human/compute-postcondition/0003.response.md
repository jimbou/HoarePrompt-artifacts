Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the first element of `l`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `score` has been updated to be equal to the first element of the sorted list `l`, since `i` is 0 and `l[i]` refers to the first element of the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
