The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2), so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `2 * n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the smallest integer in `l`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, and `_` is not defined.**
