The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the range of `int(input())`. If `_` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not defined, `int(input())` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the sum of all even-indexed integers in `l`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, and `_` is 1, and the sum of all even-indexed integers in the list `l` which is equal to `score` is being printed**
