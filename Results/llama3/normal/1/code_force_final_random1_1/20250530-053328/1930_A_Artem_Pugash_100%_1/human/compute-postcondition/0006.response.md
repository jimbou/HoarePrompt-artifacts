To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again.


At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2), so `i` becomes 4. For the loop to execute again, `2 * n` must be greater than 4.


State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is greater than or equal to twice the first element of `l`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 4**
