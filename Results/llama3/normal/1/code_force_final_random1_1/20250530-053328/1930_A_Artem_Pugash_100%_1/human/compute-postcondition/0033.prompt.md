Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    score = 0
    for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
        score += l[i]
    print(score)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is greater than or equal to the sum of every other element in `l` starting from the first one, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `2 * n - 2`, and the value of `score` which is greater than or equal to the sum of every other element in `l` starting from the first one is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the sum of all even-indexed integers in `l`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, and `_` is not defined, and the sum of all even-indexed integers in the list `l` which is equal to `score` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `i` is equal to 2 * `n`, `_` is 1, and the score which is the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
