Reasoning:
The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, which represents the number of pairs of integers on the whiteboard.
3.  It then reads `2n` integers, sorts them in ascending order, and stores them in the list `l`.
4.  The program initializes a variable `score` to 0, which will store the maximum final score.
5.  It then iterates over the sorted list `l` in steps of 2, starting from the first element (index 0). For each pair of integers, it adds the smaller integer (which is the first element of the pair due to sorting) to the `score`.
6.  After processing all pairs, it prints the maximum final score for the current test case.

The program's logic is correct because it follows the optimal strategy for achieving the maximum final score:

*   Sorting the integers ensures that the smallest integers are paired together, maximizing the score.
*   By adding the smaller integer of each pair to the score, the program accumulates the maximum possible score.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
