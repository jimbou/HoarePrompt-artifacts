The code `score += l[i]` adds the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l` to the variable `score`. Since `i` is 2, we are adding the third element of the list `l` to `score`. The list `l` is sorted, so the third element is at least as large as the smallest integer in `l`, which is equal to `score`. Therefore, `score` is increased by at least its current value.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is at least twice the smallest integer in `l`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, and `_` is not defined.**
