The code `score += l[i]` adds the value of the `i-th` element of the list `l` to the variable `score`. Since `i` is 0, it adds the first element of the list `l` to `score`. The list `l` is sorted, but we don't know its exact values, so we can't determine the exact value of `score` after the addition. However, we know that `score` was initially 0, so it will now be equal to the first element of the list `l`.

The other variables are not affected by this code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the first element of `l`, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 0, `_` is 1**
