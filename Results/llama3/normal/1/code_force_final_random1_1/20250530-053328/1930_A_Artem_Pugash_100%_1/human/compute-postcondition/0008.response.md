Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is greater than or equal to the sum of every other element in `l` starting from the first one, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `2 * n - 2`**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `n` remains unchanged, the list `l` remains sorted, the score is the sum of every other element in the list starting from the first one, the standard input remains empty, and the loop counter `i` has reached its final value of `2 * n - 2`.
