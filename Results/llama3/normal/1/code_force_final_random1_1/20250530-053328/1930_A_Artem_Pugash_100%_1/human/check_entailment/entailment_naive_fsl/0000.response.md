Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order and then iterates over the list in steps of 2, adding the smaller of each pair of integers to the score. This approach ensures that the minimum value of each pair is added to the score, maximizing the final score.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the number of integers is odd, the program still works correctly because it only considers pairs of integers.
* When the integers are all the same, the program still works correctly because it adds the minimum value of each pair to the score.
* When the integers are in any order, the program still works correctly because it sorts the list before iterating over it.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
