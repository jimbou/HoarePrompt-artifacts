Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is equal to the sum of all even-indexed integers in `l`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, and `_` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the value of `n` remains unchanged, the list `l` remains sorted, the `score` is the sum of all even-indexed integers in `l`, the standard input `stdin` is still empty, the loop variable `i` is now equal to twice the value of `n`, and the variable `_` remains undefined.
