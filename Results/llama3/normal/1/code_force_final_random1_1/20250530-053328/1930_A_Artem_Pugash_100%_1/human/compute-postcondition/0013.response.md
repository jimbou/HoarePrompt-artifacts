The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer greater than 0 does ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 1 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `score` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `_` is not defined**
