Based on the precondition, we can determine the output as follows:

* `n` is an integer, but its value is not specified.
* `l` is a sorted list of integers, but its elements are not specified.
* `score` is equal to the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element. This means that `score` is the sum of the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, ... of `l`.
* `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* `i` is equal to 2 * `n`, but this variable is not used in the print statement.
* `_` is 1, but this variable is not used in the print statement.

Since the exact elements of `l` are not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `score`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of every other element of `l` starting from the first element.

Output: **the sum of every other element of l starting from the first element**
