Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than `i+2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. `array2` is a list containing the first element which is a positive integer equal to `arr[0] * a` and the rest of the elements as described in the precondition.**

In this output state, the value of `array2` has been updated by appending the product of `arr[0]` and `a` as its first element. The rest of the variables and their values remain the same as in the initial state.
