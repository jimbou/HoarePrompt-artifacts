Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is within the range of 2 to `n`, `array2` is appended with the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b/a`.**

In this output state, the value of `array2` has been updated by appending the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b/a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
