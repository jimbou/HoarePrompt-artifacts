Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. `i` is equal to `n`. `array2` is a list containing elements that are positive integers less than `b` or equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` where the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` has reached the value of `n`, and `array2` contains elements that are either positive integers less than `b` or equal to the product of the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` and `a`, but only for those indices where the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
