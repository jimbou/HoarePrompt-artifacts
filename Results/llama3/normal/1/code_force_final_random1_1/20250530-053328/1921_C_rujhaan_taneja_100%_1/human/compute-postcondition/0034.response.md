Output State: **test_cases is a positive integer greater than n+1, i equals n+1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, arr is a list of n positive integers, feat is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b, array2 is an empty list.**

The code snippet reads input from stdin to update the values of `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr`. The first line assigns a list of four positive integers from stdin to `feat`, overwriting its previous value. The second line assigns the first element of `feat` to `n`, updating its value. The third line assigns the second element of `feat` to `f`, updating its value. The fourth line assigns the third element of `feat` to `a`, updating its value. The fifth line assigns the last element of `feat` to `b`, updating its value. The sixth line assigns a list of `n` positive integers from stdin to `arr`, overwriting its previous value. The seventh line initializes an empty list `array2`. No other variables are affected.
