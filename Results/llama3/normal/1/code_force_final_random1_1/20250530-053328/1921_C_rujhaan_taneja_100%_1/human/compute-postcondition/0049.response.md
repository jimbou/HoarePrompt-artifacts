Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than `i+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 1, then if the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer less than `b`. Otherwise, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If `i` is not equal to 1, then if the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing two elements: one is a positive integer less than `b` and the other is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.***
