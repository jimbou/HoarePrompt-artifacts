Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is within the range of 2 to `n`, `array2` has an additional element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`.**

In this output state, the values of `test_cases`, `n`, `stdin`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `feat`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `array2` now has an additional element, which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. This is because the code `array2.append(arr[0] * a)` appends the product of the first element of `arr` and `a` to `array2`.
