The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `test_cases`. If `i` is less than `test_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `test_cases` must be greater than `n+1`. 
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. `i` is equal to `n+1`. `array2` is a list containing elements that are positive integers less than `b` or equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` where the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`. If the sum of `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
