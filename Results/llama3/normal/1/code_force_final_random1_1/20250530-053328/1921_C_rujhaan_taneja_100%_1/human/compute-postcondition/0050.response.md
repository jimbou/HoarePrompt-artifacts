Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than `i+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 0, then if `arr[0]` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing two elements: the first element is a positive integer less than `b` and the second element is `arr[0] * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains as described in the precondition. If `i` is not 0, then if `i` is 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer less than `b`. If `i` is 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is not less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If `i` is not 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing two elements: one is a positive integer less than `b` and the other is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If `i` is not 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is not less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.***
