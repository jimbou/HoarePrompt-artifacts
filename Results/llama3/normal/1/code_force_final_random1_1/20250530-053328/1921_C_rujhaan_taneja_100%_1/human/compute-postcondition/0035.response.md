To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is initialized to `n+1` before the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range. We also need to adjust `n` to be a positive integer greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than n+1, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `array2` is an empty list**
