The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is within the range of 1 to `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n`. So `i` is within the range of 2 to `n` and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is within the range of 2 to `n`. If `i` is 1, then if the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` has an additional element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. If `i` is not 1, then if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is appended with the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**
