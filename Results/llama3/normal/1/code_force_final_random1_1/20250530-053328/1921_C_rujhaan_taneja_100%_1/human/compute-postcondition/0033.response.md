The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `test_cases`. If `i` is less than `test_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `test_cases` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `test_cases` must be greater than `n+1`.
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `i` equals `n+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. `array2` is a list containing elements which are the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a` if the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`. If the sum of `array2` plus the product of the difference between `n` and the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
