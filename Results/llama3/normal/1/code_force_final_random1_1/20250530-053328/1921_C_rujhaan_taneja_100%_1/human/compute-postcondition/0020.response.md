Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is at least `i` increased by 1, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. `array2` is a list containing one positive integer: `arr[0] * a`.**

In this output state, the code has appended the product of the first element of `arr` and `a` to `array2`, regardless of the value of `i` or the difference between the elements of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
