Functionality: **This function determines whether a given sequence of integers can be traversed within a certain cost limit. It takes multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of four integers (n, f, a, and b) and a list of n positive integers. The function calculates the cost of traversing the list based on the differences between consecutive elements and the given parameters a and b. If the total cost is less than the given limit f, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.**
