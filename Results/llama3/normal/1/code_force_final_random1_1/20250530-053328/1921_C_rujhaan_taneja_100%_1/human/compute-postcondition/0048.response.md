Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than `i+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 1, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer less than `b` if the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, otherwise `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If `i` is not equal to 1, then if the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer less than `b` and another element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `stdin`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `feat` remain the same. The value of `array2` is updated by appending a new element which is the product of the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` and `a`. If `i` is 1, `array2` will contain one element which is a positive integer less than `b` if the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, otherwise it will contain one element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If `i` is not equal to 1, `array2` will contain one element which is a positive integer less than `b` and another element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, otherwise it will contain one element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.
