To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is a positive integer, which means it is already at least 1, so we don't need to adjust it. However, we need to set the initial value of `i` to 0, as it will be used as the loop counter.

State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1} for 1 <= i < n.**
