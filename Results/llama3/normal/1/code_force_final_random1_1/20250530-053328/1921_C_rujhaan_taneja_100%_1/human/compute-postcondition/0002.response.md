Output State: **test_cases is a positive integer, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, arr is a list of n positive integers, array2 is an empty list, feat is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b.**

The code first reads the first line of the current test case from stdin, which contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. It assigns these integers to the list `feat`. Then, it extracts the values of n, f, a, and b from `feat` and assigns them to separate variables. After that, it reads the second line of the current test case from stdin, which contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. It assigns these integers to the list `arr`. Finally, it initializes an empty list `array2`. The value of `test_cases` and `i` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one.
