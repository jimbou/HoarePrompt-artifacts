Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `array2` is an empty list. The current value of `i` is 0. Additionally, the first element of `arr` is less than the result of dividing `b` by `a`.**
