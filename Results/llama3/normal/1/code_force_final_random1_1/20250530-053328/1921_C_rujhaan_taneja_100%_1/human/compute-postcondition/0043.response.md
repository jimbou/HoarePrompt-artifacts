Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `i` is not equal to 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer less than `b`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.***
