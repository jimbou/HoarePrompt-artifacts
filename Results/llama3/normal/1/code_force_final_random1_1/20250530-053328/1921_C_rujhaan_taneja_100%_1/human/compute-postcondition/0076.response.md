Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is within the range of 0 to `n-1`. If `i` is 0, then if the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list. If `i` is within the range of 1 to `n-1`, then if the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of `a` and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr`.**
