Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is at least 1, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one positive integer: `arr[0] * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.***
