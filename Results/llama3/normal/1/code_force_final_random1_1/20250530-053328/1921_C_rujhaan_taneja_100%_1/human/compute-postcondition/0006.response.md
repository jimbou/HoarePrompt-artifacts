Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is at least 1, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `array2` is a list containing one positive integer: `arr[0] * a`, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. The first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `array2` has been updated to contain one positive integer, which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state.
