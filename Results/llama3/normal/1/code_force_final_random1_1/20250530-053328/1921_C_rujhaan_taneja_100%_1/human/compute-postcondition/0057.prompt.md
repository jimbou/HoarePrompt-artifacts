Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a positive integer greater than n+1, i equals n+1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, arr is a list of n positive integers, feat is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b, array2 is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if i == 0:
        if arr[0] < b / a:
            array2.append(arr[0] * a)
    elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 0, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a` if the first element of `arr` is less than the result of dividing `b` by `a`, otherwise `array2` is an empty list. If `i` is not equal to 0, then if the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer less than `b`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than `i+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 0, then if `arr[0]` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing two elements: the first element is a positive integer less than `b` and the second element is `arr[0] * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains as described in the precondition. If `i` is not 0, then if `i` is 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer less than `b`. If `i` is 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is not less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If `i` is not 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing two elements: one is a positive integer less than `b` and the other is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If `i` is not 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is not less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than `i+2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 0, then if `arr[0]` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing the first element which is a positive integer equal to `arr[0] * a` and the rest of the elements as described in the precondition. Otherwise, `array2` remains as described in the precondition. If `i` is not 0, then if `i+1` is 0, `array2` is a list containing two elements: the first element is a positive integer less than `b` and the second element is `arr[0] * a`. If `i+1` is 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer less than `b`. If `i+1` is 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is not less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a`. If `i+1` is not 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing two elements: one is a positive integer less than `b` and the other is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a`. If `i+1` is not 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is not less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a. Additionally, if the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` now contains an additional element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
