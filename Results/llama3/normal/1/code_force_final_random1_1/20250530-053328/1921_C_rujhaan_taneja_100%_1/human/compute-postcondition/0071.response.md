Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, the current value of `i` is 0. If the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.***
