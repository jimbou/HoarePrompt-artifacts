Output: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. `i` is equal to `n`. `array2` is a list containing elements that are positive integers less than `b` or equal to `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` where the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`. The current value of the sum of `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, and 'Yes' is printed**
