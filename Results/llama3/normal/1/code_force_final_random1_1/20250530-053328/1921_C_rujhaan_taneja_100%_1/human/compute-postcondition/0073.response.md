Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is within the range of 1 to `n-1`, `array2` is an empty list. The current value of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`.***
