Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a positive integer, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, arr is a list of n positive integers, array2 is an empty list, feat is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if i == 0:
        if arr[0] < b / a:
            array2.append(arr[0] * a)
    elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is at least 1, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 0 and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one positive integer: `arr[0] * a`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is at least `i` increased by 1, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 1 and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one positive integer: `arr[0] * a`. If `i` is not equal to 1 and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, then `array2` contains an additional element which is the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is at least `i` increased by 1, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 0, then `array2` is a list containing one positive integer: `arr[0] * a` if the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a` if the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, then `array2` contains an additional element which is the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
