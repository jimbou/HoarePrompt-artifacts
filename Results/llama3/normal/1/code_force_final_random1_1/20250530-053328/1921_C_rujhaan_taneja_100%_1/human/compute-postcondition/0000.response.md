Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1} for 1 <= i < n.**

The code reads the number of test cases from the input and assigns it to the variable `test_cases`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines of input. The values of the other variables are not affected.
