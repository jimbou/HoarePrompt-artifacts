Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than `i+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `arr[0]` is less than `b/a`, then `array2` is a list containing two elements: the first element is a positive integer less than `b` if `i` is not equal to 1 or if the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a` when `i` is 1, otherwise the first element is a positive integer, and the second element is `arr[0] * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains as described in the precondition.***
