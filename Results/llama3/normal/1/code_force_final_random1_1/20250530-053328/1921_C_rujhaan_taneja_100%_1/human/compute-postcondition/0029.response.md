Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. `array2` is a list containing elements which are the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a` if the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`. The sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `b` and the difference between `n` and the length of `array2` is greater than or equal to `f`***
