The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`.
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than `i+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 1, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer less than `b` if the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, otherwise `array2` is an empty list. If `i` is not equal to 1, then if the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer less than `b`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.**
