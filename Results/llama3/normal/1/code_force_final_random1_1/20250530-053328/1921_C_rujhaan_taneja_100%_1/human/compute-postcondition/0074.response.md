Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is within the range of 1 to `n-1`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of `a` and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr`. The current value of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `array2` has been updated to include a new element, which is the product of `a` and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a` is still valid.
