Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `i` is not equal to 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer less than `b`**

In this output state, the value of `array2` has been updated to contain one element which is the product of `a` and the difference between the current element and the previous element in the list `arr`. This difference is less than `b/a`, so the product is less than `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
