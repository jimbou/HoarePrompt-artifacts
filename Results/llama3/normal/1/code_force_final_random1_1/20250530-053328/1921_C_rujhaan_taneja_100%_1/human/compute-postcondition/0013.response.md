The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. 
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is at least `i` increased by 1, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is 1 and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one positive integer: `arr[0] * a`. If `i` is not equal to 1 and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.**
