Output State: **test_cases is a positive integer greater than n+1, n is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, f, a, and b are positive integers, arr is a list of n positive integers, feat is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b, i is equal to n+1, array2 is an empty list.**

The code first reads a line from stdin and splits it into four integers, which are assigned to the variables n, f, a, and b, respectively. This means that stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two. The second line reads another line from stdin, splits it into n integers, and assigns them to the list arr. The third line initializes an empty list called array2. The values of test_cases, i, and the original values of n, f, a, and b are not modified by the code.
