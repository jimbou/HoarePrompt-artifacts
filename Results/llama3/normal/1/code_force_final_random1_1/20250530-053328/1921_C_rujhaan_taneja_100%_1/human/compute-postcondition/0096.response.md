Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is equal to `n`, `array2` is a list containing the products of `a` and the differences between consecutive elements in `arr` that are less than `b/a`, as well as the product of `a` and the first element of `arr` if it is less than `b/a`. If the sum of `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
