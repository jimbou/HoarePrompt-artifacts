Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is not equal to 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is at least 1, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. The current value of `i` is such that the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`.**

In this output state, the code has appended a new element to the `array2` list, which is the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still such that the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`.
