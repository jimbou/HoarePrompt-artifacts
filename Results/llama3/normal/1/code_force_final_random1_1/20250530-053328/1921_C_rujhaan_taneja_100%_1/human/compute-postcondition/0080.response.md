Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is within the range of 1 to `n`, `array2` is appended with the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`**.

In this output state, the values of `test_cases`, `n`, `stdin`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `feat`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `array2` is appended with a new value, which is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the `arr` list, multiplied by `a`.
