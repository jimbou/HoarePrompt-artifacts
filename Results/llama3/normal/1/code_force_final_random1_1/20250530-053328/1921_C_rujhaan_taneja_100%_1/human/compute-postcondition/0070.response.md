Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, the current value of `i` is 0, and `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `array2` has been updated to include the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. The first element of `arr` is less than the result of dividing `b` by `a`, so the product is also less than `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
