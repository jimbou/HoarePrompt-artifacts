Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a positive integer greater than n+1, n is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, f, a, and b are positive integers, arr is a list of n positive integers, feat is a list of four positive integers: n, f, a, and b, i is equal to n+1, array2 is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if i == 0:
        if arr[0] < b / a:
            array2.append(arr[0] * a)
    elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is within the range of 0 to `n-1`. If `i` is 0, then if the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list. If `i` is within the range of 1 to `n-1`, then if the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of `a` and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is within the range of 1 to `n`. If `i` is 0, then if the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` has an additional element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. If `i` is not 0, then if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is appended with the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is within the range of 2 to `n`. If `i` is 0, then if the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` has an additional element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. If `i` is not 0, then if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is appended with the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `array2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
