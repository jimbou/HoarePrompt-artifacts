Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is equal to `n`, `array2` is a list containing the products of `a` and the differences between consecutive elements in `arr` that are less than `b/a`, as well as the product of `a` and the first element of `arr` if it is less than `b/a`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `test_cases`, `n`, `stdin`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `feat` as in the initial state. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The list `array2` will contain the products of `a` and the differences between consecutive elements in `arr` that are less than `b/a`, as well as the product of `a` and the first element of `arr` if it is less than `b/a`.
