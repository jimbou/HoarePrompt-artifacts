The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a positive integer less than `n`, `n` is a positive integer greater than `i+1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than `i+2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. If `i+1` is 0, then if `arr[0]` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing two elements: the first element is a positive integer less than `b` and the second element is `arr[0] * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains as described in the precondition. If `i+1` is not 0, then if `i+1` is 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer less than `b`. If `i+1` is 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is not less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a`. If `i+1` is not 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing two elements: one is a positive integer less than `b` and the other is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a`. If `i+1` is not 1 and the difference between the current and previous elements in `arr` is not less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is a positive integer equal to `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a**
