Output State: **`test_cases` equals 0, `i` equals `n`, `stdin` contains no test cases, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. `array2` is a list containing elements that are the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a` if the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`. If the sum of `array2` plus the product of the difference between `n` and the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input, and the variables `test_cases`, `i`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `feat`, and `array2` have reached their final values. The loop has printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case based on the condition specified in the loop body.
