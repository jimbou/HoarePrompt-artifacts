#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1} for 1 <= i < n.
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        
        f = feat[1]
        
        a = feat[2]
        
        b = feat[-1]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(0, n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] < b / a:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
            elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `test_cases` equals 0, `i` equals `n`, `stdin` contains no test cases, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. `array2` is a list containing elements that are the product of the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` and `a` if the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`. If the sum of `array2` plus the product of the difference between `n` and the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given sequence of integers can be traversed within a certain cost limit. It takes multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of four integers (n, f, a, and b) and a list of n positive integers. The function calculates the cost of traversing the list based on the differences between consecutive elements and the given parameters a and b. If the total cost is less than the given limit f, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.
