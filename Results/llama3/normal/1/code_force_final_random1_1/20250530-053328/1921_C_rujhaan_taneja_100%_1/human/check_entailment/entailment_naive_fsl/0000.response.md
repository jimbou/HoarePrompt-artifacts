Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the first message is sent at moment 0. In this case, the program does not account for the charge consumed by the phone being on from moment 0 to the moment the first message is sent. 

For example, if the input is:

1 10 1 5
0

The program will output "Yes", but the correct output should be "No" because the phone's charge will drop to 0 at moment 0, and Stepan will not be able to send the message.

The program only checks if the charge consumed by turning the phone on and off is less than the initial charge, but it does not consider the charge consumed by the phone being on from moment 0 to the moment the first message is sent. 

To fix this issue, the program should also check if the charge consumed by the phone being on from moment 0 to the moment the first message is sent is less than the initial charge. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[-1]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        array2 = []
        if arr[0] * a > f:
            print('No')
            continue
        for i in range(0, n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] < b / a:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
            elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```
