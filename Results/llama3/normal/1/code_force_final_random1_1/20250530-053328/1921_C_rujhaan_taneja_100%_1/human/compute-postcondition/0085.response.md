Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `feat` is a list of four positive integers: `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, `i` is within the range of 2 to `n`. If the first element of `arr` is less than `b/a`, `array2` has an additional element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`.***
