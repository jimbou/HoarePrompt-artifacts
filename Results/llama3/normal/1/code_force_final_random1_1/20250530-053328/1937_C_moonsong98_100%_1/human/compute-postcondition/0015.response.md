The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is larger than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be larger than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer larger than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, 0, 0, 1)`. If `res` equals '<', then `max_index` is 1. Otherwise, `max_index` remains 0.**
