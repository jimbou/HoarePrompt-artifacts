Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices i and j in a secret sequence p such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program uses three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3.

Func_1 is used to ask queries in the format "? a b c d" and returns the result of the comparison between (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d) as a string.

Func_2 is used to print the values of two non-negative integers a and b, less than the number of elements in the secret sequence p, to the standard output, followed by a flush operation to ensure the output is displayed immediately.

Func_3 is the main function that determines the maximum and minimum indices based on the results of func_1 and then calls func_2 with these indices. If the input n is 2, it directly calls func_2 with arguments 0 and 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the range of n to find the maximum index where func_1 returns '<', and then finds the minimum index where func_1 returns '<' or '='. If multiple minimum indices are found, it selects the one that returns '=' when compared to itself. Finally, it calls func_2 with the maximum and minimum indices.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum and minimum indices and uses the functions as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
