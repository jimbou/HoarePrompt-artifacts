Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, `min_index` is equal to `i` if `res` equals '=', `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=', and `min_indices` must be empty, and the function `func_2` has been executed with arguments `max_index` and `min_index`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the function `func_2` has been executed with the current values of `max_index` and `min_index`. The values of the variables `n`, `max_index`, `res`, `min_index`, and `min_indices` remain unchanged, as the code snippet only executes a function call without assigning any new values to these variables.
