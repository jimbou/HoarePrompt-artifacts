The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `min_indices`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `min_indices`. If `min_indices` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `min_indices` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, `min_index` is equal to `i` if `res` equals '=', `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=', `min_indices` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second element in the list.**
