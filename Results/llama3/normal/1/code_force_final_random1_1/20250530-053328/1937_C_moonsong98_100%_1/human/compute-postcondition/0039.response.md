Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 2, `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, `min_indices` is a list containing `i` which is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise it is a list containing `max_index` and also contains `i` which is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still an integer larger than 2, `max_index` is still the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is still 2, `res` is still the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, `min_indices` is a list containing `i` which is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise it is a list containing `max_index` and also contains `i` which is 2.
