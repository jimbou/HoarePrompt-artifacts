This function determines the maximum and minimum indices based on the results of the `func_1` function and then calls the `func_2` function with these indices. If the input `n` is 2, it directly calls `func_2` with arguments 0 and 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the range of `n` to find the maximum index where `func_1` returns '<', and then finds the minimum index where `func_1` returns '<' or '='. If multiple minimum indices are found, it selects the one that returns '=' when compared to itself. Finally, it calls `func_2` with the maximum and minimum indices. The function does not return any value.
