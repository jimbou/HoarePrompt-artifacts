To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for i in min_indices:`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is an integer larger than 0.
- `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'.
- `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`. If `res` equals '=', `min_index` is equal to `i`. If `i` equals `max_index`, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.
- `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=', and `min_indices` must not be empty.

To execute the loop again, we need to consider the state of `i` and `min_indices` since these are the variables involved in the loop head.

1. **Adjusting `i`**: Since `i` iterates over `min_indices`, for the loop to execute again, `i` should move to the next index in `min_indices`. Assuming the list `min_indices` is ordered and we've just finished an iteration with a certain `i`, the next `i` should be the next element in `min_indices`.

2. **Adjusting `min_indices`**: The list itself doesn't need adjustment for the loop to execute again, but its contents are crucial. Since we're considering the next iteration, we don't need to change the list's contents for the loop to proceed; we only need to ensure that there is a next element for `i` to iterate over.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`. If `res` equals '=', `min_index` is equal to `i`. If `i` equals `max_index`, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, no changes are made. `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=', `min_indices` must not be empty, and `i` is the next index in `min_indices`.**
