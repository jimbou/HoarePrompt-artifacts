Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, 2, 0, 2)`, `max_index` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `max_index` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `res` is still the value returned by `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`, but now `max_index` is 2, so the function call is effectively `func_1(0, 2, 0, 2)`.
