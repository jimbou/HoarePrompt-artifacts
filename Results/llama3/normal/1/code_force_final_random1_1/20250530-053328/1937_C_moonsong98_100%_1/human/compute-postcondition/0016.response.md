Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`, `max_index` is either 0 or 1 depending on the previous value of `res`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the result of calling `func_1` with arguments 0, `max_index`, 0, and `i`. The value of `max_index` is either 0 or 1, depending on the previous value of `res`. If the previous value of `res` was '<', then `max_index` is 1; otherwise, it remains 0. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
