Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, `min_index` is equal to `i` if `res` equals '=', `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=', `min_indices` must have at least 2 elements, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `n`, `max_index`, `res`, `min_index`, and `min_indices` remain unchanged.
