Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 2, `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, `min_indices` is a list containing `i` which is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise it is a list containing `max_index`**

The value of `res` has been updated to the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, where `min_indices[0]` is either 1 or `max_index` depending on the previous value of `res`. The other variables remain unchanged.
