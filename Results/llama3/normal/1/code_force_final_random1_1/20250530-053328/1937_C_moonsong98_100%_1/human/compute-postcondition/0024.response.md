Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 0, `min_indices` is a list containing `i`, `res` is '<'.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `min_indices`, which is a list containing the current value of `i`, which is 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `min_indices` now contains the current value of `i`, which is 0.
