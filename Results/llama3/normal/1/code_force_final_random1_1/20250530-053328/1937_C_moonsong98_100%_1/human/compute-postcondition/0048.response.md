Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=', and `min_indices` must not be empty. If `i` equals `max_index`, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been updated to the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, while the values of `n`, `max_index`, and `min_indices` remain unchanged. The condition that `min_indices` must not be empty still holds. Additionally, if `i` equals `max_index`, the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop, otherwise, no changes are made.
