Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 1, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 1, `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index` if `res` is '=', otherwise it is a list containing `i`**.

In this output state, the value of `res` is determined by the result of the function call `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 1)`. If `res` is '=', then `min_indices` still contains `max_index`. If `res` is '<', then `min_indices` now contains `i`, which is 1. The values of `n`, `max_index`, and `i` remain unchanged.
