Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, `min_index` is equal to `i` if `res` equals '=', `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=', and `min_indices` must be empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has iterated over all indices in `min_indices` and updated `min_index` accordingly. Since `min_indices` is empty after the loop finishes, it means that all indices have been processed, and `min_index` holds the last updated value. The state of other variables like `n` and `max_index` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
