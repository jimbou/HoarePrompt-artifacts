According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer larger than 0, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, the loop starts from 0, so `i` needs to be adjusted to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 0, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`**
