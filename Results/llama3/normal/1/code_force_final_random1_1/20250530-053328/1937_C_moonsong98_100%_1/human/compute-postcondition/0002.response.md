Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, and the current value of `n` is 2, and a function `func_2` has been called with arguments 0 and 1.**

The code calls a function named `func_2` with two arguments, 0 and 1. Since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine the exact impact of the function call on the program state. However, we can conclude that the function `func_2` has been called with the specified arguments. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as there is no assignment or modification of `n` in the given code.
