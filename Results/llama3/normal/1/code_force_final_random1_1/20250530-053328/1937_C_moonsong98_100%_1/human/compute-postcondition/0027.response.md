Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 0, `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index` and 0, `res` is '='**

The code appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `min_indices`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `min_indices` now contains two elements: `max_index` and 0. The rest of the variables retain their initial values.
