Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, `max_index` will be the largest index `i` for which the function `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', the loop variable `i` will be one less than the initial value of `n`, and `res` will be the result of the last call to `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`.
