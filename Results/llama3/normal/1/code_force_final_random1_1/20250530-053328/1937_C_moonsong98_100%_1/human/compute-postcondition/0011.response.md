According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is larger than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be larger than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer larger than 1, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1, `res` is either '<' or the value returned by `func_1(0, 0, 0, 0)`**
