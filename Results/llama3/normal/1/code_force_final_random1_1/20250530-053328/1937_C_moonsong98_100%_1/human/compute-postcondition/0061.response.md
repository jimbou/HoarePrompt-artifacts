Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, `min_index` is equal to `i` if `res` equals '=', `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=', `min_indices` must have at least 2 elements.**

The code only updates the value of `res` by calling the function `func_1` with the current `min_index` as arguments. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res` is now the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, which may be '<', '=', or '>' depending on the implementation of `func_1`. The rest of the initial state remains valid, including the conditions on `max_index`, `min_index`, and `min_indices`.
