Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '='.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is an integer larger than 0. The variable `max_index` remains the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'. The variable `i` takes on the value of `n-1` after the loop finishes executing. The variable `res` holds the result of the last iteration of the loop, which is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`. The list `min_indices` contains all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=' during the execution of the loop.
