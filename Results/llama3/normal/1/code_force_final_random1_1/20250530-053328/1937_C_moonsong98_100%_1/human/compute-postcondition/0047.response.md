Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=', and `min_indices` must not be empty. If `i` equals `max_index`, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
