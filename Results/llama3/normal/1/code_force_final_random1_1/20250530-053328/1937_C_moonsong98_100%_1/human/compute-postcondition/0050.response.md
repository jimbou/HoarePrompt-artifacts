Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` and equals '=', `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=', and `min_indices` must not be empty. `min_index` is equal to `i`. If `i` equals `max_index`, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `min_index` has been updated to be equal to `i`, which is the current index being processed. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The code only updates the value of `min_index` and does not affect the values of `n`, `max_index`, `res`, or `min_indices`. The condition that `min_indices` must not be empty is still valid, and the behavior of skipping to the next iteration of the most internal loop when `i` equals `max_index` is still in effect.
