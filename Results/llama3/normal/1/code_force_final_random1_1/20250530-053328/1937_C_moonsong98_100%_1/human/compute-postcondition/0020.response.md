Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(0, max_index, 0, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `max_index`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `min_indices`, which is a list containing the value of `max_index`.
