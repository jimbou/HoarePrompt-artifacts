Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality to find the maximum XOR value between any two indices in the secret sequence p. The program uses the functions func_1 and func_2 to interact with the user and find the maximum and minimum indices based on the results of the func_1 function. The program handles the case when n is 2 separately and directly calls func_2 with arguments 0 and 1. For n greater than 2, the program iterates through the range of n to find the maximum index where func_1 returns '<', and then finds the minimum index where func_1 returns '<' or '='. If multiple minimum indices are found, it selects the one that returns '=' when compared to itself. Finally, it calls func_2 with the maximum and minimum indices.

Correctness: **True**
