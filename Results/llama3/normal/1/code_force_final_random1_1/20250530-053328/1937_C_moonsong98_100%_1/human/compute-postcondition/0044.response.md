To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `min_indices`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `min_indices` is not empty, i.e., it contains at least one index.
2. Since `min_index` is the smallest index `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=', we can infer that `min_index` is the first element in `min_indices`.
3. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `i` to the first element in `min_indices`, which is `min_index`.

The other variables (`n`, `max_index`, `res`, and `min_indices`) do not need to be adjusted, as their values do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is `min_index`, `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n-1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=', `min_index` is the smallest index `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=', and `min_indices` must not be empty**
