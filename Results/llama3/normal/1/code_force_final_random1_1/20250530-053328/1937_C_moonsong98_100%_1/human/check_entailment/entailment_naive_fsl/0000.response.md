Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum and minimum indices, and then uses these indices to find the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR operation.

The program first finds the maximum index by comparing the OR operation of each pair of indices with the OR operation of the current maximum index and the current index. This is done using the `func_1` function, which prints the query and returns the result.

Once the maximum index is found, the program finds the minimum indices by comparing the OR operation of the maximum index and each index with the OR operation of the maximum index and the current minimum index. This is done using the `func_1` function again.

The program then finds the minimum index among the minimum indices by comparing the OR operation of each minimum index with itself. This is done using the `func_1` function again.

Finally, the program prints the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR operation using the `func_2` function.

The program handles all potential cases, including the case where n is 2, and uses at most 3n queries as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
