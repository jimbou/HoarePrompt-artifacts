Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `res` is the result of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, `min_index` is equal to `i`, `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '<' or '=', `min_indices` must have at least 2 elements.**

In this output state, the value of `min_index` has been updated to be equal to `i`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `min_indices` must have at least 2 elements is still valid.
