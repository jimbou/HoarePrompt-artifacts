Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 1, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 1, `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 1)`, `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index` if `res` is '=', otherwise it is a list containing `i` and 1**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `min_indices`. Since `i` is 1, the list `min_indices` now contains either `max_index` and 1 if `res` is '=', or 1 and 1 if `res` is not '='. The other variables remain unchanged.
