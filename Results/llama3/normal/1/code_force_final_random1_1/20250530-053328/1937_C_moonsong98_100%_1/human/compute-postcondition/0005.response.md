Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, `max_index` is 0, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `max_index` has been initialized to 0. The other variables, `n`, remain unchanged, so `n` is still an integer larger than 0 and not equal to 2. The stdin still contains no input.
