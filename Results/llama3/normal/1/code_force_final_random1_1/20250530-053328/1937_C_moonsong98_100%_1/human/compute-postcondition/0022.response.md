Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 0, `res` is the value returned by `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the result of `func_1(max_index, max_index, max_index, 0)`, which is a new value. The other variables remain unchanged.
