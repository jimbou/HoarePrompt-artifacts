The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is larger than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be larger than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer larger than 1, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 1, `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`. If `res` is '<', then `min_indices` is a list containing `i`. If `res` is '=', then `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index` and 0.**
