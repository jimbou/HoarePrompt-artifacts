Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer larger than 2, `max_index` is the largest index `i` for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', `i` is 2, `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`. If `res` is '<', then `min_indices` is a list containing 2. If `res` is '=', then `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index` and 2. If `res` is '>', then `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`.***
