Functionality: This function takes a list of positive integers and three positive integers na, nb, and nc that sum up to the length of the list, and attempts to distribute the numbers into three groups (group_a, group_b, group_c) such that the sum of numbers in each group meets a certain condition defined by func_1. If successful, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
