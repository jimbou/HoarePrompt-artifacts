I'll be happy to help you with this task. However, I notice that the function `distribute_number(num)` is not defined in the given code snippet. To provide an accurate output state, I need to know the definition of this function.

Could you please provide the definition of the `distribute_number(num)` function or clarify how it affects the variables in the initial state? I'll be happy to help you calculate the output state once I have this information.

Please provide the definition of the function, and I'll respond with the output state in the required format.
