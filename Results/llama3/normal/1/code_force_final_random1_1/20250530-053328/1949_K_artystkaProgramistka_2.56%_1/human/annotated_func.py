#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are positive integers representing the sides of a triangle.
    return a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a
    #The program returns True if the sum of the lengths of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the length of the third side, and False otherwise.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether three positive integers can form a valid triangle by checking if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side, returning True if the condition is met and False otherwise.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na + nb + nc = n, and numbers is a list of n positive integers.

    #State: n is a positive integer, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na + nb + nc = n, numbers is an empty list, group_a, group_b, and group_c are lists with at least one number, sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are updated accordingly, and num is no longer in the list numbers.

        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES' and three lists group_a, group_b, and group_c, each containing at least one number, and the sum of the numbers in each list is such that func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) returns True.
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function takes a list of positive integers and three group sizes as input, sorts the list in descending order, and distributes the numbers into three groups. It then checks if the sums of the numbers in each group meet a certain condition (defined by the function func_1). If the condition is met, the function returns 'YES' along with the three groups; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
