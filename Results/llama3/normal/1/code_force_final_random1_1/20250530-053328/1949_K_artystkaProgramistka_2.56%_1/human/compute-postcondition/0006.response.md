To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for num in numbers:`, so we can only adjust the state of `num` and `numbers`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the second number in the list has been distributed among the groups. This means that the list `numbers` has been modified, and the second number is no longer in the list.

For the loop to execute again, the list `numbers` must have at least one more number. Since the list is sorted in descending order, the next number to be distributed must be the third number in the original list.

The state of `num` needs to be updated to the third number in the original list.

The other variables (`n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`) are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a sorted list of `n-4` positive integers in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists with at least one number, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are updated accordingly, and `num` is the third number in the original list**
