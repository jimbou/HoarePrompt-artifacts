Functionality: This function takes a list of positive integers and three group sizes as input, sorts the list in descending order, and distributes the numbers into three groups. It then checks if the sums of the numbers in each group meet a certain condition (defined by the function func_1). If the condition is met, the function returns 'YES' along with the three groups; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
