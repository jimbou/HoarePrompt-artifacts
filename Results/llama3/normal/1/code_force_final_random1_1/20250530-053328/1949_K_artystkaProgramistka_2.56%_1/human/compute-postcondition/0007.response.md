Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a sorted list of `n-5` positive integers in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists with at least one number, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are updated accordingly, and `num` is no longer the third number in the original list, it has been distributed to one of the groups.**

In this output state, the function `distribute_number(num)` has been executed, and the number `num` has been distributed to one of the groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c`). The size of the `numbers` list has decreased by 1, and the sums of the groups (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`) have been updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
