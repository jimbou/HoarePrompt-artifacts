To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for num in numbers:`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the first number in the list `numbers` is now the new `num`. This means that the list `numbers` has been modified by removing its first element.

For the loop to execute again, the list `numbers` must have at least one more element. Therefore, the state of `numbers` needs to be adjusted to reflect that it now has `n-2` positive integers.

The state of `num` also needs to be adjusted, as it is now the second number in the list `numbers`.

The other variables in the state (`n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a sorted list of `n-2` positive integers in descending order, `num` is the second number in the list, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists with at least one number, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are updated accordingly**
