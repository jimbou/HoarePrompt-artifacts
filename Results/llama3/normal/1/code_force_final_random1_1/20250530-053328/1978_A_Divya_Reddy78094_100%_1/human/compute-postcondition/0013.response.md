Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and greater than or equal to the number of iterations, _ is t-1, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, and the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list nums except the last one and the last element in the list nums has been printed t times**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable t will be equal to the number of iterations that were executed, the variable _ will be one less than the number of iterations, the variable n will still be an integer, the variable nums will still be a list of integers, and the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list nums except the last one and the last element in the list nums will have been printed t times.
