Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive) and greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was already an integer, its type remains the same, but its value is updated to the input value. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `nums`. Since `nums` was already a list of integers, its type remains the same, but its value is updated to the input list.

The variable `t` is not affected by the code, so its value remains an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive) and greater than 1. The variable `_` is also not affected, so its value remains 1.

The final state includes the updated values of `n` and `nums`, as well as the unchanged values of `t` and `_`.
