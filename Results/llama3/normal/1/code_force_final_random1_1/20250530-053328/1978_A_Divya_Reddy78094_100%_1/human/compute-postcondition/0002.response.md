Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers**

The code consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and greater than 0, and `_` is 0, these values remain unchanged. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `nums`. Since `n` is an integer, its value is not affected by this line. The value of `t` and `_` also remains unchanged.
