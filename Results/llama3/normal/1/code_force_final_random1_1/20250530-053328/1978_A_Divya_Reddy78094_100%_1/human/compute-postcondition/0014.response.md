Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. It reads an integer t, then for each test case (t times), it reads an integer n and a list of n space-separated integers. For each test case, it prints the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list except the last one and the last element. The function modifies the state of the program by consuming input from stdin and producing output. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed, and the results have been printed t times.**
