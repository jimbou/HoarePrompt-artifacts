The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) and greater than 0. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers**
