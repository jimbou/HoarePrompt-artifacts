Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The stdin still contains the test cases, but the first integer (which is `t`) has been consumed. The rest of the input remains the same, with each test case consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
