Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 500 (inclusive) and greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, and the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list nums except the last one and the last element in the list nums is being printed**

The code consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `nums`. The sum of the maximum of all elements in the list `nums` except the last one and the last element in the list `nums` is being printed. 

The initial state of `t` is an integer between 3 and 500 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers. After the code executes, `n` is updated to the integer value of the input, and `nums` is updated to a list of integers from the input. The sum of the maximum of all elements in the list `nums` except the last one and the last element in the list `nums` is being printed. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
