Based on the initial state, the code `print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])` will print the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list `nums` except the last one and the last element in the list `nums`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `nums[:-1]` slices the list `nums` to exclude the last element. This creates a new list containing all elements except the last one.
2. `max(nums[:-1])` finds the maximum value among the elements in this sliced list.
3. `nums[-1]` accesses the last element of the original list `nums`.
4. The `+` operator adds the maximum value from step 2 and the last element from step 3.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list `nums` except the last one and the last element in the list `nums`.

Output: **sum of the maximum of all elements in the list nums except the last one and the last element in the list nums**
