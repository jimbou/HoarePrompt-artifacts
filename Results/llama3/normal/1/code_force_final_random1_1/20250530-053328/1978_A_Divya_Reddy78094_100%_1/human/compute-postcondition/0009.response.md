The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive) and greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ must be 2 and t must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer between 3 and 500 (inclusive) and greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer, nums is a list of integers, and the sum of the maximum of all elements in the list nums except the last one and the last element in the list nums is being printed**
