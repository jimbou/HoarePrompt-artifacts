Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the output state is as follows:**

*   The loop has terminated because the value of `nums.get(start, 0)` has become 0.
*   The value of `start` is the last value it had when the loop terminated.
*   The set `vis` contains all the values that `start` had during the execution of the loop.
*   The count of each value in `nums` is the number of times that value appeared in `arr` minus the number of times it was decremented during the execution of the loop.
*   If `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` was greater than 0 during the last iteration of the loop, then `start` is the last value it had when the loop terminated. Otherwise, `start + 1` was printed during the last iteration of the loop.

In summary, the loop has finished executing, and the output state reflects the final values of the variables that were modified during the loop's execution. The loop terminated when the count of the current value of `start` in `nums` became 0, and the final values of `start`, `vis`, and `nums` are determined by the loop's execution.
