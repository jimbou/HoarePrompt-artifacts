The variable in the loop head is nums and start, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable nums and start.  If nums.get(start, 0) is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nums.get(start, 0) is 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time the value of nums.get(start, 0) needed to have been greater than 0.
State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers and must contain at least one 0, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts. If nums contains the key start + 1, then start is 2, vis is a set containing 0 and 1, the count of 0 in nums is one less than its original value, the count of 1 in nums is two less than its original value, and the count of start + 1 in nums is one less than its original value and nums.get(start, 0) is greater than 0. Otherwise, start is 1, vis is a set containing 0 and 1, the count of 0 in nums is one less than its original value, the count of 1 in nums is one less than its original value, and the value of start + 1 which is 2 is being printed and nums.get(start, 0) is greater than 0.**
