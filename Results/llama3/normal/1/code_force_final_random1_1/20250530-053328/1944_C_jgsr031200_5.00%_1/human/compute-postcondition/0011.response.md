Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers and must contain at least one 0, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, start is 2, vis is a set containing 0 and 1, the count of 0 in nums is one less than its original value, and the count of 1 in nums is two less than its original value, and the count of start + 1 in nums is one less than its original value.**

The code first decrements the count of `start + 1` in the `nums` dictionary by 1, then increments the value of `start` by 1. As a result, the count of `start + 1` in `nums` is reduced by 1, and the value of `start` becomes 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
