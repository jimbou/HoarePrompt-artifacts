Postcondition: ***arr is a list of non-negative integers and must contain at least one 0, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, start is either 1, 2, or 3, vis is a set containing 0, 1, and the original value of start, the count of 0 in nums is one less than its original value, the count of 1 in nums is either one or two less than its original value depending on the original value of start, the count of the original value of start + 1 in nums is either one less than its original value if start is 2 or the value of start + 1 which is 2 is being printed if start is 1, and nums.get(the original value of start, 0) is greater than 0. If nums.get(start + 1, 0) is greater than 0, then start is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, start + 1 is being printed, where start + 1 is either 2 or 3.***
