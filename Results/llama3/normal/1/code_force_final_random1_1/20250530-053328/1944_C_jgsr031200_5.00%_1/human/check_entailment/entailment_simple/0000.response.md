Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program uses a counter `nums` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `arr`. It then iterates through the numbers starting from 0, and for each number, it checks if it exists in the counter. If it does, it decrements the count and moves to the next number. If it doesn't, it prints the current number plus one as the final score.

The program's logic is correct because it simulates the game by iterating through the numbers and removing them from the counter, effectively simulating Alice's and Bob's moves. The final score is printed when the loop finishes executing, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1(arr)` is called, but it is not defined anywhere in the program. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is run.

Correctness: **False** (due to the undefined function `func_1(arr)`)
