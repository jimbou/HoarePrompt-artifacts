Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers and must contain at least one 0, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, start is 0, vis is a set containing 0, and the count of 0 in nums is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. The dictionary `nums` still contains the same keys (elements from `arr`), but the value associated with the key `0` (which is the value of `start`) has been decremented by 1. The variable `start` retains its initial value of 0. The set `vis` now contains the element 0, which was added in the first line of the code.
