Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score in the game.

The function `func_1(arr)` takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the smallest number that is not present in the list. It does this by iterating through the list, decrementing the count of each number and its successor if present, until it finds a number that is not present in the list. The function prints this number as output.

The strategy used in the function is correct. Alice's goal is to maximize the score, which means she wants to include as many numbers as possible in her list `c`. Bob's goal is to minimize the score, which means he wants to exclude as many numbers as possible from Alice's list `c`.

The function correctly implements this strategy by iterating through the list and decrementing the count of each number and its successor if present. This ensures that Alice includes as many numbers as possible in her list `c`, while Bob excludes as many numbers as possible.

The function also correctly handles the case where the input list contains duplicate numbers. In this case, the function decrements the count of each number and its successor if present, which ensures that Alice includes as many numbers as possible in her list `c`, while Bob excludes as many numbers as possible.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
