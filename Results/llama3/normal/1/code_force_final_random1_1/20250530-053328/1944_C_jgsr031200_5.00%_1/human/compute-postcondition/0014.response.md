Postcondition: ***arr is a list of non-negative integers and must contain at least one 0, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts. If nums contains the key start + 1, then start is 2, vis is a set containing 0 and 1, the count of 0 in nums is one less than its original value, the count of 1 in nums is two less than its original value, and the count of start + 1 in nums is one less than its original value. Otherwise, start is 1, vis is a set containing 0 and 1, the count of 0 in nums is one less than its original value, the count of 1 in nums is one less than its original value, and the value of start + 1 which is 2 is being printed.***
