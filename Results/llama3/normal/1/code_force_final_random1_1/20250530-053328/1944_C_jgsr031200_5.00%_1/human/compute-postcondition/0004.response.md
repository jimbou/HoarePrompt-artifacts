Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers and must contain at least one 0, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, start is 1, vis is a set containing 0, and the count of 0 in nums is one less than its original value. The current value of start + 1 is a key in nums and its count is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of start has been incremented by 1, and the count of the key start + 1 in the dictionary nums has been decremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
