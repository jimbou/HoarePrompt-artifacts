Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score while Bob wants to minimize it. The program uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n, trying to find the smallest number that is not in the array or has an odd count. If such a number is found, it means that Alice can choose this number to maximize the score, and the program prints this number. If no such number is found, it means that Bob can always choose a number to minimize the score, and the program prints 0.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the array is empty, the case where the array contains only one element, and the case where the array contains multiple elements. The program also correctly handles the case where the array contains duplicate elements.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
