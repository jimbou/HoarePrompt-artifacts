Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the input list. Then, it iterates through the numbers starting from 0, decrementing the count of each number and its successor if present. The first number that is not present in the list (i.e., its count is 0) is the smallest number that is not present in the list, which is the MEX of the list. The program prints this number as output.

The program correctly handles the case where the input list contains duplicate numbers, as it decrements the count of each number and its successor if present. It also correctly handles the case where the input list does not contain all numbers from 0 to n-1, as it will print the smallest number that is not present in the list.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
