Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, start is 0, vis is an empty set**

Here's a brief explanation of the output state:

* The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify it.
* The first line creates a dictionary `nums` using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, which counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`. The keys of `nums` are the elements from `arr`, and the values are their respective counts.
* The second line initializes a variable `start` to 0, which is a new variable introduced by the code.
* The third line creates an empty set `vis`, which is another new variable introduced by the code.

Note that the code does not modify the original list `arr`, but rather creates new variables `nums`, `start`, and `vis` with their respective values.
