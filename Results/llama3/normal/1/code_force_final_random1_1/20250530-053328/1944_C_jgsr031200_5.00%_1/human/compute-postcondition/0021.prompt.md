Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of non-negative integers, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, start is 0, vis is an empty set
Code of the loop:
while nums.get(start, 0):
    vis.add(start)
    nums[start] -= 1
    if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
        nums[start + 1] -= 1
        start += 1
    else:
        print(start + 1)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: arr is a list of non-negative integers and must contain at least one 0, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, start is 1, vis is a set containing 0, and the count of 0 in nums is one less than its original value. The current value of start + 1 is a key in nums and its count is greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *arr is a list of non-negative integers and must contain at least one 0, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts. If nums contains the key start + 1, then start is 2, vis is a set containing 0 and 1, the count of 0 in nums is one less than its original value, the count of 1 in nums is two less than its original value, and the count of start + 1 in nums is one less than its original value. Otherwise, start is 1, vis is a set containing 0 and 1, the count of 0 in nums is one less than its original value, the count of 1 in nums is one less than its original value, and the value of start + 1 which is 2 is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *arr is a list of non-negative integers and must contain at least one 0, nums is a dictionary where keys are elements from arr and values are their respective counts, start is either 1, 2, or 3, vis is a set containing 0, 1, and the original value of start, the count of 0 in nums is one less than its original value, the count of 1 in nums is either one or two less than its original value depending on the original value of start, the count of the original value of start + 1 in nums is either one less than its original value if start is 2 or the value of start + 1 which is 2 is being printed if start is 1, and nums.get(the original value of start, 0) is greater than 0. If nums.get(start + 1, 0) is greater than 0, then start is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, start + 1 is being printed, where start + 1 is either 2 or 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
