To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since the loop starts from 1 and increments by 2). The value of `i` should be 1 for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-10` test cases, `n` is an integer at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 2, `i` is 1**
