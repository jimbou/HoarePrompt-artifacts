Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-6 test cases, `n` is an integer at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 1, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n`, and either the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` are both '<', or the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` are both '<', and 'No' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is still 1, and the conditions regarding the characters at index `i` in `a` and the characters at index `i + 1` or `i - 1` in `b` are still satisfied. Additionally, the program has printed 'No' and has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
