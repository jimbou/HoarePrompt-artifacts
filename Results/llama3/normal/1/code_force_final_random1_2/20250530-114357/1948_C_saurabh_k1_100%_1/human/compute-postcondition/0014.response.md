The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (because the step is 2), so `i` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer at least 5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 0, `i` is 5**
