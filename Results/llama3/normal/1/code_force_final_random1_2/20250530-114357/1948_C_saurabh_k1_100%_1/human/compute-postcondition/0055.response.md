Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-10` test cases, `n` is an integer at least 6, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 2, `i` is 5, and 'No' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The program execution is interrupted, and we exit the current loop or if statement. The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged.
