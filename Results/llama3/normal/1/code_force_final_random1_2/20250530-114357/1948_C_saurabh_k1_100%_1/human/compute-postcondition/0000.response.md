Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. n is even.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n and two strings of length n, where n is even. The values of the other variables are not affected.
