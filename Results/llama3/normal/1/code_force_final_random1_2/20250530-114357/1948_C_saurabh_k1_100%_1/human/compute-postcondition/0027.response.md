Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-6 test cases, `n` is an integer at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 1. If `i + 1` is less than `n` and either the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` are both '<', or the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` are both '<', then 'No' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
