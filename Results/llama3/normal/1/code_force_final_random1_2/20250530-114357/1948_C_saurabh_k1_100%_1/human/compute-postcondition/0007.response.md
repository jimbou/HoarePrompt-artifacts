Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), the number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-2`, `n` is still an integer at least 3, `a` and `b` are still strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is still 0, and `i` is still 1. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
