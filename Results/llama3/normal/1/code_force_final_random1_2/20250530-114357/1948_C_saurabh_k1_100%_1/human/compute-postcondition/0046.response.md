Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-10` test cases, `n` is an integer at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 2, `i` is 1. If `i + 1` is less than `n` and either `a[i]` equals `b[i + 1]` equals '<' or `a[i]` equals `b[i - 1]` equals '<', then the string 'No' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without printing 'No' or breaking out of the loop.***
