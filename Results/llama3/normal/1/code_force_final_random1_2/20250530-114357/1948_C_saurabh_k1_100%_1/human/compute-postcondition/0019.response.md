Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 0, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, `n` if `n` is even. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then 'No' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. Otherwise, 'yes' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until it has checked all the pairs of adjacent characters in the strings `a` and `b` that are separated by an even index. If at any point it finds a pair of '<' characters, it will print 'No' and break out of the loop. If it successfully checks all the pairs without finding any '<' characters, it will print 'yes'. The final state of the variables will depend on whether the loop broke out early or completed all its iterations. If the loop broke out early, the value of `i` will be the index of the pair of '<' characters that caused the loop to break, and `stdin` will contain `t-3` test cases. If the loop completed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n` if `n` is even, and `stdin` will still contain `t-2` test cases.
