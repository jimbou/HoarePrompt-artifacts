Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 0, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n`. The current value of `a` and `b` are such that either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<'.**
