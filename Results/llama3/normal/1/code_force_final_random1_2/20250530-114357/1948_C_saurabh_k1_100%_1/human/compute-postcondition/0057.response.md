Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-10` test cases, `n` is an integer at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 2, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, `n` if `n` is even. If no 'No' was printed, then 'yes' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be either `n-1` (if `n` is odd) or `n` (if `n` is even), depending on the parity of `n`. Additionally, if the loop did not encounter any conditions that would print 'No' and break out of the loop, then the program will print 'yes'. The values of `t`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
