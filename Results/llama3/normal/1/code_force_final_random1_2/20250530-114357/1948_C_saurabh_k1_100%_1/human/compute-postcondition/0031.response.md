Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-6 test cases, `n` is an integer at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 1, `i` is an integer between 3 and `n-1` (inclusive), 'No' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged, and 'No' is still being printed.
