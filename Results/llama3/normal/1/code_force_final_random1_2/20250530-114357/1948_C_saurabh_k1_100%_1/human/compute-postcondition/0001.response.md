To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution). According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. n is even, `_` is 0**
