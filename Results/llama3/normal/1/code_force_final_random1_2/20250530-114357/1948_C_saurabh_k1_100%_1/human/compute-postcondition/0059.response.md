Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an even-length string of '<' and '>' characters. It then checks if the strings can be rearranged to form a valid sequence of '<' and '>' characters, and prints 'yes' if possible and 'no' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.**
