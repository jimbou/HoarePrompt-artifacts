Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-10` test cases, `n` is an integer at least 4, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 2, `i` is 3. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
