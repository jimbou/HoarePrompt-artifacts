Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-6 test cases, `n` is an integer at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 1, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n`, and either the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` are both '<', or the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` are both '<'.**
