Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer at least 5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 0, `i` is 5, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet contains a break statement, which means that the execution of the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement, and the 'No' that was being printed is still being printed.
