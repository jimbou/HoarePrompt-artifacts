Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer at least 4, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 0, `i` is 3, 'No' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside, but does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
