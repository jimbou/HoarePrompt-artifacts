Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-7 test cases, `n` is an integer at least 5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 1, `i` is an integer between 5 and `n-1` (inclusive), 'No' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and stdin now contains t-7 test cases instead of t-6.
