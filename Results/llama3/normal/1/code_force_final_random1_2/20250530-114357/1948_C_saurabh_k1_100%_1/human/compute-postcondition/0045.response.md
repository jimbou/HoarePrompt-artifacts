Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-10` test cases, `n` is an integer at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 2, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n`. The current value of `a` and `b` are such that either `a[i]` equals `b[i + 1]` equals '<' or `a[i]` equals `b[i - 1]` equals '<'. The string 'No' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that `i + 1` is less than `n` still holds, and the relationship between `a` and `b` at index `i` and `i + 1` or `i - 1` also remains the same. Additionally, the string 'No' is still being printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
