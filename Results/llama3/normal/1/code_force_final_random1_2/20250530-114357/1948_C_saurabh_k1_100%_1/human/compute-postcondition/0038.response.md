Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-6 test cases, `n` is an integer at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 1, `i` is n-1 if n is odd, n if n is even.**

The loop will execute until `i` reaches `n-1` (if `n` is odd) or `n` (if `n` is even). At this point, the loop will terminate, and the program will continue executing the code after the loop. The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be the same as the initial state, with the only difference being the value of `i`, which will be either `n-1` or `n` depending on whether `n` is odd or even.
