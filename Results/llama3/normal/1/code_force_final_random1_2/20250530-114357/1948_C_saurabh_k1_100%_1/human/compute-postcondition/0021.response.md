Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-6 test cases, n is an integer at least 2, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, _ is 1, i is n-1 if n is odd, n if n is even**

The code reads three lines from stdin: an integer n, and two strings a and b. The value of n is assigned to the variable n, and the strings a and b are assigned to the variables a and b, respectively. The value of t is not affected by the code, so it remains an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). The value of _ is also not affected, so it remains 1. The value of i is not directly affected by the code, but its value depends on the parity of n, so it remains n-1 if n is odd, and n if n is even. The stdin now contains t-6 test cases, since three lines have been read from it.
