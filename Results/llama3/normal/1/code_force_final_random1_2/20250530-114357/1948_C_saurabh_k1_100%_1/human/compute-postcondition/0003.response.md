To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 2). Therefore, we can adjust the state of `n` to be at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 0, `i` is 1**
