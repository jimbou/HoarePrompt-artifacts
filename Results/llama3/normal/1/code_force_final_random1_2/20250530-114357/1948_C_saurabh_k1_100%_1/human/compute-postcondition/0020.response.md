To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, so we can only adjust the state of `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 1, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, `n` if `n` is even**
