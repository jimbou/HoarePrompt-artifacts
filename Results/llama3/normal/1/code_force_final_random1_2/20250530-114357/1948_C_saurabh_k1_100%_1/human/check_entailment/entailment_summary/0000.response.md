Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid and arrow directions.

The program iterates over the columns in steps of 2, checking if there are any pairs of '<' arrows in the same column or adjacent columns that would prevent the robot from reaching the cell (2, n). If it finds such a pair, it prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop. If it doesn't find any such pairs after checking all columns, it prints 'yes'.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the constraints of the problem, such as the robot's movement rules and the fact that n is even. It also correctly handles the edge cases where the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **True**
