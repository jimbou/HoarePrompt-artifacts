Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) in the grid based on the given problem description.

The program iterates over the columns of the grid in steps of 2, starting from the second column (index 1). For each pair of columns, it checks if there is a way for the robot to move to the right by checking if the arrows in the current and next columns are both pointing to the left. If it finds such a pair of columns, it prints 'No' and breaks the loop. If it doesn't find any such pair, it prints 'yes'.

This approach is correct because if the robot can't move to the right at any point, it will be stuck in an infinite loop and can't reach the cell (2, n). On the other hand, if it can always move to the right, it will eventually reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **True**
