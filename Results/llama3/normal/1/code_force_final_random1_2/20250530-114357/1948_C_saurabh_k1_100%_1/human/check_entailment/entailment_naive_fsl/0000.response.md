Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

4
>><<
>><>

The program will print "yes", but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4) because the arrow in the cell (1, 2) points to the left, and the robot cannot move left from that cell.

The program only checks if there are any pairs of arrows pointing to the left in the same column, but it does not consider the case where the robot moves down and then encounters an arrow pointing to the left. 

To fix this, the program needs to simulate the robot's movement and check if it can reach the cell (2, n) by following the arrows.
