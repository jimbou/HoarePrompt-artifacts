To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter, and `t`, which is the upper limit of the range.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` remains the same.

So, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 2
* `t` is still an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive)

The other variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-7 test cases, `n` is an integer at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `_` is 2, `i` is n-1 if n is odd, n if n is even**
