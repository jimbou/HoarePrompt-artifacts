Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer at least 2, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, _ is t-1, i is n-1 if n is odd, n if n is even. If no 'No' was printed, then 'yes' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable t will be between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin will contain 0 test cases, n will be an integer at least 2, a and b will be strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, _ will be t-1, and i will be n-1 if n is odd, n if n is even. If no 'No' was printed during the execution of the loop, then 'yes' will be printed.
