Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-10 test cases, n is an integer at least 2, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, _ is 2, i is n-1 if n is odd, n if n is even**

The code reads the value of `n` from stdin, which is an integer at least 2. It then reads two strings `a` and `b` from stdin, each of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` is not modified by the code, so it remains either `n-1` if `n` is odd or `n` if `n` is even. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 3, as three inputs are read from stdin.
