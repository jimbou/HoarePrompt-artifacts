Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, _ is 0**

The code reads the first test case from stdin, which consists of an integer n and two strings a and b. The value of n is assigned to the variable n, and the strings a and b are assigned to the variables a and b, respectively. The variable _ remains unchanged with a value of 0. The remaining test cases (t-2) are still in stdin.
