This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts a sequence of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer (the length of the array) followed by a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The function then calculates and prints the absolute difference between each element in the array and 0, for all test cases.
