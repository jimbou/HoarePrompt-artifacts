Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, arr is a list of integers, mex is a list containing one or two integers, used is a dictionary containing key-value pairs, minn is an integer, and i is 2, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n].**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `arr` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `mex` has been appended with the value of `minn`, which is either greater than or equal to `n + 1` or 0, depending on the value of the current element of the array `arr[i]`. The dictionary `used` has been updated with a new key-value pair, where the key is the value of `minn` and the value is `True`. The value of `minn` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
