Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of integers, mex is a list containing one integer equal to minn, used is a dictionary containing {0: True, 1: True, 2: True, ..., n: True} if the current element of the array (arr[i]) is greater than 0, or a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, and the value is True if the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, minn is greater than or equal to n + 1 if the current element of the array (arr[i]) is greater than 0, or 0 if the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being the values of the variables in the loop head and body. The loop continues to increment `minn` until it is no longer in the `used` dictionary. If the current element of the array is greater than 0, `minn` will be greater than or equal to `n + 1`, and if the current element of the array is less than or equal to 0, `minn` will be 0. The `used` dictionary will contain key-value pairs for all integers from 0 to `n` if the current element of the array is greater than 0, or a single key-value pair with the key being the absolute difference between the current element of the array and 0 if the current element of the array is less than or equal to 0. The `mex` list will contain a single integer equal to `minn`. The `i` variable remains at 1, and the `stdin` contains multiple inputs as described in the initial state.
