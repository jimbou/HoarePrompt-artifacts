To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `minn` and `used` because they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `minn` is in `used`. At the end of the last iteration, `minn` is an integer incremented by 1, and `used` must contain `minn` as a key. However, this does not ensure that the loop will execute again, because `minn` has been incremented. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `minn` to be a value that is still in `used`.

Since `used` must contain `minn` as a key, we can adjust the state of `minn` to be the same as its previous value, which is `minn` is an integer. This ensures that `minn` is still in `used`, and the loop can execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is a list containing one or two integers, `used` must contain `minn` as a key, `minn` is an integer, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases.**
