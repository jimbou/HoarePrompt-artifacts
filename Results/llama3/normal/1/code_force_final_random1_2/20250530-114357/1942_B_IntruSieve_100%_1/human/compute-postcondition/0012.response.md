Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, arr is a list of integers, mex is a list containing one integer equal to the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, used is a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, and the value is True, minn is 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n], where n is the length of the list, and the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and the value of minn (which is 0) to the list mex. Since the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, the absolute difference will be equal to the absolute value of the current element. The second line adds a key-value pair to the dictionary used, where the key is the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, and the value is True. The values of n, arr, minn, i, and stdin remain unchanged.
