Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[1]` is 0, `mex` is a list containing one integer equal to 1, `used` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is True, `minn` is 1, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `minn` being equal to 1. The value of `mex` is also updated to be equal to `minn`, which is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
