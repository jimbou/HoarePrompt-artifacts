According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `minn` and `used`. If `minn` is in `used`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `minn` is an integer greater than 2 and `used` contains at least one key-value pair where the key is 1 and the value is True. `used` containing at least one key-value pair where the key is 1 and the value is True does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `used` contains at least one key-value pair where the key is equal to `minn` and the value is True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[1]` is 0, `mex` is a list containing one integer equal to 1, `used` contains at least one key-value pair where the key is equal to `minn` and the value is True, `minn` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple inputs.**
