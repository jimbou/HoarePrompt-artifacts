Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is greater than 0, then mex is a list containing n integers, used is a dictionary containing {0: True, 1: True, 2: True, ..., n: True}, minn is greater than or equal to n + 1, and i is n - 1. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, then mex is a list containing n integers equal to the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, used is a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, and the value is True, minn is 0, and i is n - 1.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows:

- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, indicating the length of the array.
- `arr` is a list of integers, representing the input array.
- `stdin` contains multiple inputs, each consisting of two inputs: the length of the array and the array elements.
- If the current element of the array (`arr[i]`) is greater than 0, then:
  - `mex` is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer is the minimum value not present in the array up to that point.
  - `used` is a dictionary containing all integers from 0 to `n` as keys, indicating that all these values have been used in the array.
  - `minn` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, indicating that all values up to `n` have been used.
  - `i` is `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed for all iterations.
- If the current element of the array (`arr[i]`) is less than or equal to 0, then:
  - `mex` is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer is the absolute difference between the current element and 0.
  - `used` is a dictionary containing one key-value pair, where the key is the absolute difference between the current element and 0, and the value is True.
  - `minn` is 0, indicating that no values have been used in the array.
  - `i` is `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed for all iterations.
