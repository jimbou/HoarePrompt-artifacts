Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation p based on the given array a. The program uses a list `mex` to store the constructed permutation and a dictionary `used` to keep track of the used numbers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program iterates over the input array `arr`. For each element `arr[i]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is greater than 0.
2. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it appends the current minimum non-negative integer `minn` to the `mex` list and marks it as used in the `used` dictionary. It then increments `minn` until it finds the next non-used integer.
3. If `arr[i]` is not greater than 0, it calculates the absolute difference between `minn` and `arr[i]`, appends it to the `mex` list, and marks it as used in the `used` dictionary.
4. After iterating over the entire input array, the program prints the constructed permutation `mex`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. The use of the `used` dictionary ensures that each number in the permutation is unique, and the calculation of the absolute difference between `minn` and `arr[i]` ensures that the constructed permutation satisfies the given condition.

Correctness: **True**
