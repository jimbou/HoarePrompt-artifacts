Functionality: This function reads input from stdin, where the first input is an integer representing the number of test cases, followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer representing the length of the array, and the second input is a space-separated list of integers representing the elements of the array. The function then processes each test case, creating a list of integers (mex) based on the elements of the array. If an element is greater than 0, the function appends the current minimum value (minn) to mex and increments minn until it is no longer in the used dictionary. If an element is less than or equal to 0, the function appends the absolute difference between the element and 0 to mex. The function then prints each element of mex, followed by a newline character. The function repeats this process for each test case.
