Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is a list containing one or two integers, `used` must contain all integers from the initial value of `minn` up to the final value of `minn` as keys, `minn` is an integer increased by the number of iterations of the loop, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains an integer greater than 2, `arr` remains a list of integers, `mex` remains a list containing one or two integers, `used` contains all integers from the initial value of `minn` up to the final value of `minn` as keys, `minn` is an integer increased by the number of iterations of the loop, `i` remains 2, and `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases.
