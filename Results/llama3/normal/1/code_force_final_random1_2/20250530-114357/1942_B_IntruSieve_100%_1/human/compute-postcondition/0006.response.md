To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `minn` and `used` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `minn` is in `used`. At the end of the last iteration, `minn` is 1 and `used` contains {0: True}. For the loop to execute again, `minn` must not be in `used`. Since `minn` is 1, we need to adjust `used` so that it does not contain 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is a list containing 0, `minn` is 1, `used` is a dictionary containing {0: True} and does not contain 1, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. The current value of `i` is 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.**
