Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, arr is a list of integers, mex is a list containing 0, minn is greater than or equal to n + 1, used is a dictionary containing {0: True, 1: True, 2: True, ..., n: True}, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. The current value of i is 0. The current value of arr[i] is greater than 0.**

The loop will continue to execute until `minn` is no longer in `used`. Since `used` contains all integers from 0 to `n`, the loop will execute until `minn` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`. At this point, `minn` will not be in `used`, and the loop will terminate. The values of `n`, `arr`, `mex`, `stdin`, `i`, and `arr[i]` remain unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.
