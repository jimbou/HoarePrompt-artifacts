Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation p that satisfies the given array a. The program uses a list `mex` to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array, and a dictionary `used` to keep track of the used numbers. The program iterates through the array a, and for each element, it checks if it is positive or negative. If it is positive, it appends the current minimum non-negative integer to the `mex` list and updates the minimum non-negative integer. If it is negative, it appends the absolute value of the difference between the current minimum non-negative integer and the element to the `mex` list. Finally, it prints the elements of the `mex` list, which represents a valid permutation p that satisfies the given array a.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the cases where the array a contains only positive numbers, only negative numbers, or a mix of both. It also correctly handles the case where the array a contains duplicate numbers. The program's logic is sound, and it does not contain any errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is correct.
