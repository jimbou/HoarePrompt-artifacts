Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is greater than 0, then `mex` is a list containing one or two integers, `used` must contain all integers from the initial value of `minn` up to the final value of `minn` as keys, `minn` is an integer increased by the number of iterations of the loop, and `i` is 2. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, then `mex` is a list containing three integers equal to the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, `used` is a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, and the value is True, `minn` is 0, and `i` is 2.**
