Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of integers, mex is a list containing one integer equal to minn, used is a dictionary containing {0: True, 1: True, 2: True, ..., n: True} if the current element of the array (arr[i]) is greater than 0, or a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, and the value is True if the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, minn is greater than or equal to n + 1 if the current element of the array (arr[i]) is greater than 0, or 0 if the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n].
Code of the loop:
while minn in used:
    minn += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[1]` is 0, `mex` is a list containing one integer equal to 1, `used` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is True, `minn` is 1, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple inputs.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[1]` is 0, `mex` is a list containing one integer equal to 1, `used` contains at least one key-value pair where the key is 1 and the value is True, `minn` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple inputs.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[1]` is 0, `mex` is a list containing one integer equal to 1, `used` contains at least one key-value pair where the key is equal to `minn+1` and the value is True, `minn` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple inputs.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
