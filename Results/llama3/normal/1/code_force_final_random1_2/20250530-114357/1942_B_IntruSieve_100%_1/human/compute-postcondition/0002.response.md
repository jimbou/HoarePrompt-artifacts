Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, arr is a list of integers, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, used is an empty dictionary, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. The current value of i is 0. The current value of arr[i] is greater than 0***
