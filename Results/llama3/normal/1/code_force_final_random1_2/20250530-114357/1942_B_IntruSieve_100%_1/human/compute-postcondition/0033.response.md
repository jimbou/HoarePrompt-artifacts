Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is a list containing one or two integers, `used` must contain `minn + 2` and `minn + 1` as keys, `minn` is an integer increased by 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, so it is now `minn + 1`. The `used` dictionary still contains `minn + 1` and `minn` as keys, but now `minn` is equal to `minn + 1` from the previous state. The other variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` still contains multiple inputs, a sequence of test cases.
