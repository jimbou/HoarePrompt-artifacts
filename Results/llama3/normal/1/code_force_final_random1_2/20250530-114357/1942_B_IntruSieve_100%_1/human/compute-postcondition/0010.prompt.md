Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, arr is a list of integers, mex is a list containing 0, minn is 0, used is a dictionary containing {0: True}, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. The current value of i is 0. The current value of arr[i] is greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
while minn in used:
    minn += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is a list containing 0, `minn` is 1, `used` is a dictionary containing {0: True}, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. The current value of `i` is 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is a list containing 0, `minn` is 2, `used` is a dictionary containing {0: True} and does not contain 1, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. The current value of `i` is 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is a list containing 0, `minn` is greater than 3 or `used` is a dictionary containing {0: True, 2: True} and does not contain 1, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. The current value of `i` is 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
