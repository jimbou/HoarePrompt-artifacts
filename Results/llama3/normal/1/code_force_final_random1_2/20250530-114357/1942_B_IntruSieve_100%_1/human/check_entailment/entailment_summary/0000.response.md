Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation p based on the given array a. The program uses a variable `mex` to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array, and a dictionary `used` to keep track of the used numbers. It iterates over the array, and for each element, it checks if the element is positive or negative. If the element is positive, it appends the current `mex` value to the `mex` list and increments `mex` until it finds an unused number. If the element is negative, it appends the absolute difference between the element and `mex` to the `mex` list and marks the number as used. Finally, it prints the `mex` list, which represents the constructed permutation p.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the input array contains only positive or only negative numbers. It also correctly handles the case when the input array contains duplicate numbers.

The execution summary provided is accurate, and it correctly describes the behavior of the program.

Correctness: **True**
