Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, used is an empty dictionary, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n], where n is the length of the list.**

The code executes four lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the first input to `n`, which is the number of test cases. The second line assigns a list of integers from the second input to `arr`, which represents the elements of the array. The third line initializes an empty list `mex`. The fourth line initializes a variable `minn` to 0. The fifth line initializes an empty dictionary `used`. 

After the code executes, `n` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `arr` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, `mex` is an empty list, `minn` is 0, and `used` is an empty dictionary. The stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n], where n is the length of the list.
