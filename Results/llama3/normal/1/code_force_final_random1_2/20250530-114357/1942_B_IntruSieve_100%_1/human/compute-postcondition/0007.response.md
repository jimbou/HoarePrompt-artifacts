Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is a list containing 0, `minn` is 2, `used` is a dictionary containing {0: True} and does not contain 1, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. The current value of `i` is 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `minn` being 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple inputs for the test cases. The current index `i` is still 0, and the value of `arr[i]` is still greater than 0.
