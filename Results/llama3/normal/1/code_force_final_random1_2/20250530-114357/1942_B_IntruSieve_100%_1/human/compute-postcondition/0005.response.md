Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is a list containing 0, `minn` is 1, `used` is a dictionary containing {0: True}, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. The current value of `i` is 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The input in `stdin` is still the same, waiting to be processed. The current index `i` is still 0, and the current element of the array `arr[i]` is still greater than 0.
