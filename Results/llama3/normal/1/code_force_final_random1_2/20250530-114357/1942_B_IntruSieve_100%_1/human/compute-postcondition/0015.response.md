Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of integers, mex is a list containing one integer equal to minn, used is a dictionary containing {0: True, 1: True, 2: True, ..., n: True} if the current element of the array (arr[i]) is greater than 0, or a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, and the value is True if the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, minn is greater than or equal to n + 1 if the current element of the array (arr[i]) is greater than 0, or 0 if the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n].**

The code adds the value of `minn` to the `mex` list and sets the value of `used[minn]` to `True`. If the current element of the array `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` now contains one integer equal to `minn`, which is greater than or equal to `n + 1`. If the current element of the array `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` now contains one integer equal to the absolute difference between the current element of the array `arr[i]` and 0. The `used` dictionary is updated accordingly, containing either all values from 0 to `n` or a single key-value pair with the absolute difference between the current element of the array `arr[i]` and 0 as the key. The value of `minn` remains unchanged, and `i` remains 1. The state of `n`, `arr`, and `stdin` remains unchanged.
