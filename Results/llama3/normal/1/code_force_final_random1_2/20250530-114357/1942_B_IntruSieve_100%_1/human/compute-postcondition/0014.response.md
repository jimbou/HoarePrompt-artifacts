The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is greater than 0, then mex is a list containing 0, minn is greater than or equal to n + 1, used is a dictionary containing {0: True, 1: True, 2: True, ..., n: True}, and i is 1. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, then mex is a list containing one integer equal to the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, used is a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, and the value is True, minn is 0, and i is 1.**
