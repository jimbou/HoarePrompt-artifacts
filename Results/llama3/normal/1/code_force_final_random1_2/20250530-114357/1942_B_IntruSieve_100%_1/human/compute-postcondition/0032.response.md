To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `minn` and `used` because they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `minn` is in `used`. At the end of the last iteration, `minn` is an integer increased by 1, and `used` must contain `minn + 1` as a key. For the loop to execute again, `minn` must be in `used`. Since `minn` is increased by 1, we need to adjust `used` to contain the new value of `minn` as a key.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is a list containing one or two integers, `used` must contain `minn + 1` and `minn` as keys, `minn` is an integer increased by 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases.**
