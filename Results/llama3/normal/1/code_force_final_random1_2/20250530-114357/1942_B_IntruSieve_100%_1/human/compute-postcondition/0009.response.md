Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is a list containing 0, `minn` is greater than 3 or `used` is a dictionary containing {0: True, 2: True} and does not contain 1, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. The current value of `i` is 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The input state remains the same, with multiple test cases in the standard input, each consisting of an integer and a space-separated list of integers. The current index `i` is still 0, and the current element of the array `arr[i]` is still greater than 0.
