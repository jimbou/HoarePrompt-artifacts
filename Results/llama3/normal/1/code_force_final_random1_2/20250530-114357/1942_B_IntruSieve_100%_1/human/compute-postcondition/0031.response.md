Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is a list containing one or two integers, `used` must contain `minn + 1` as a key, `minn` is an integer increased by 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, and the key in the `used` dictionary has been updated to reflect this change. All other variables remain unchanged.
