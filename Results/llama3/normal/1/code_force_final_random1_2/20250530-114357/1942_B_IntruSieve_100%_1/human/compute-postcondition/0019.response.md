Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[1]` is 0, `mex` is a list containing one integer equal to 1, `used` contains at least one key-value pair where the key is 1 and the value is True, `minn` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, making it an integer greater than 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple inputs.
