Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, which involves constructing a valid permutation `p` based on a given array `a`. The program uses a dictionary `used` to keep track of the used numbers and a list `mex` to store the minimum non-negative integers that do not appear in the array.

The program correctly handles the two cases when `arr[i]` is greater than 0 and when `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0. When `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it appends the current minimum non-negative integer `minn` to the `mex` list and updates `minn` to the next non-negative integer that has not been used. When `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the `mex` list.

The program also correctly prints the elements of the `mex` list, which represents the valid permutation `p`.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The variable `minn` is not being updated correctly when `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0. The correct update should be `minn = abs(arr[i] - minn)`, not `mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))`. This is because `minn` should be updated to the next non-negative integer that has not been used, not the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
