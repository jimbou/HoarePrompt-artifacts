According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `minn` and `used`. If `minn` is in `used`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `minn` is 2 and `used` is a dictionary containing {0: True} and does not contain 1. `minn` being 2 and `used` not containing 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so `minn` needs to be adjusted to `minn` is greater than 2 or `used` needs to be adjusted to contain 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is a list containing 0, `minn` is greater than 2 or `used` is a dictionary containing {0: True, 2: True} and does not contain 1, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. The current value of `i` is 0. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0**
