Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[1]` is 0, `mex` is a list containing one integer equal to 1, `used` contains at least one key-value pair where the key is equal to `minn+1` and the value is True, `minn` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, so it is now an integer greater than 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The `used` dictionary still contains at least one key-value pair, but the key is now equal to the new value of `minn`, which is `minn+1`. The rest of the variables and stdin remain the same as in the initial state.
