#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple inputs: the first input is an integer (the number of test cases), followed by a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n], where n is the length of the list.
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is greater than 0, then mex is a list containing n integers, used is a dictionary containing {0: True, 1: True, 2: True, ..., n: True}, minn is greater than or equal to n + 1, and i is n - 1. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, then mex is a list containing n integers equal to the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, used is a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, and the value is True, minn is 0, and i is n - 1.

    print()
    #This is printed: The absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0 (which is equal to the nth element in the list, itm)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts a sequence of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer (the length of the array) followed by a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The function then calculates and prints the absolute difference between each element in the array and 0, for all test cases.
