Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, used is an empty dictionary, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n], where n is the length of the list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > 0:
        mex.append(minn)
        used[minn] = True
        while minn in used:
            minn += 1
    else:
        mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
        used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 0, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is greater than 0, then mex is a list containing 0, minn is greater than or equal to n + 1, used is a dictionary containing {0: True, 1: True, 2: True, ..., n: True}, and i is 0. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, then mex is a list containing one integer equal to the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, used is a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, and the value is True, minn is 0, and i is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is greater than 0, then mex is a list containing one integer equal to minn, used is a dictionary containing {0: True, 1: True, 2: True, ..., n: True}, minn is greater than or equal to n + 1, and i is 1. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, then mex is a list containing two integers equal to the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, used is a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, and the value is True, minn is 0, and i is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is greater than 0, then `mex` is a list containing one or two integers, `used` must contain all integers from the initial value of `minn` up to the final value of `minn` as keys, `minn` is an integer increased by the number of iterations of the loop, and `i` is 2. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, then `mex` is a list containing three integers equal to the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, `used` is a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, and the value is True, `minn` is 0, and `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
