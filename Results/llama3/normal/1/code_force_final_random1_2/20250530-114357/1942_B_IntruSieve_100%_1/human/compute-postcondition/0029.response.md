The value of `minn` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `minn` was an integer, so the new value of `minn` is also an integer. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `mex` is a list containing one or two integers, `used` must contain `minn` as a key, `minn` is an integer incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases.**
