Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (the length of the array), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the list is equal to the integer in the first input of the test case. The integers in the list are in the range [-n, n]. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is greater than 0, then mex is a list containing n integers, used is a dictionary containing {0: True, 1: True, 2: True, ..., n: True}, minn is greater than or equal to n + 1, and i is n - 1. If the current element of the array (arr[i]) is less than or equal to 0, then mex is a list containing n integers equal to the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, used is a dictionary containing one key-value pair where the key is the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, and the value is True, minn is 0, and i is n - 1, mex is a list that must have at least 3 elements, itm is the third element in the list, and the third element in the list (itm) is printed, and this is printed: the third element in the list (itm) which is equal to the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0, and this is printed: the third element in the list (itm) which is equal to the absolute difference between the current element of the array (arr[i]) and 0**
