Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, which involves constructing a permutation `p` based on a given array `a`. The program iterates through the array `a` and calculates the minimum non-negative integer `mex` that does not appear in the prefix of `p`. If the current element `a[i]` is greater than 0, it appends `mex` to the permutation `p` and updates `mex` to the next non-negative integer that does not appear in `p`. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `mex` to `p`.

The program correctly implements the logic to construct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. It handles both cases where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 0, and updates `mex` accordingly. The program also prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

However, there is a minor issue with the program. In the second loop where it prints the elements of `mex`, the program uses `itm` as the loop variable, but it does not check if `itm` is within the bounds of the list `mex`. Although the program is designed to handle valid inputs, it may still encounter an `IndexError` if the input is malformed.

Despite this minor issue, the program is generally correct and should produce the expected output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
