To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `ls`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `ls` has at least 2 elements (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(ls)`). 

State: **`t` is a positive integer minus two and is greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of at least 2 positive integers, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five, `f` is a positive integer minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second and first elements of `ls` and `b`, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the third and second elements of `ls` and `b`, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the fourth and third elements of `ls` and `b`, ..., minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the nth and (n-1)th elements of `ls` and `b`**
