Output State: **t is a positive integer minus one and is greater than 0, n is a positive integer, a and b are positive integers, f is a positive integer minus the minimum of a times the difference between the second and first elements of ls and b, minus the minimum of a times the difference between the third and second elements of ls and b, minus the minimum of a times the difference between the fourth and third elements of ls and b, ..., minus the minimum of a times the difference between the nth and (n-1)th elements of ls and b, ls is a list of n positive integers, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `f` will be the initial value of `f` minus the sum of the minimum of `a` times the difference between consecutive elements of `ls` and `b`, for all consecutive pairs of elements in `ls`. The value of `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last index of `ls`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `ls` remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus two.
