The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and ls, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `ls`. If `i` is less than the length of `ls`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `ls` is a list of at least 3 positive integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `ls` must have at least 4 positive integers.
State: **`t` is a positive integer minus two and is greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of at least 4 positive integers, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five, `f` is a positive integer minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second and first elements of `ls` and `b`, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the third and second elements of `ls` and `b`, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the fourth and third elements of `ls` and `b`, ..., minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the nth and (n-1)th elements of `ls` and `b**, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second and first elements of `ls` and `b`, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the third and second elements of `ls` and `b**, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the fourth and third elements of `ls` and `b`.
