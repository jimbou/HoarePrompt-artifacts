Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer minus two and is greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of `n` positive integers, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five, `f` is a positive integer minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between consecutive elements of `ls` and `b` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `ls`. If the final value of `f` is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `f` is less than or equal to 0, 'NO' is printed.***
