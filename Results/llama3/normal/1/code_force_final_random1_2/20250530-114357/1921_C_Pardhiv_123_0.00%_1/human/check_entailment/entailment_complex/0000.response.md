Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. 

The program then calculates the minimum of a times the difference between consecutive elements and b for all pairs of consecutive elements in the list of integers. This is done using the line `f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)`. 

If the final value of f is greater than 0, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. This is done using the if-else statement `if f > 0: print('YES') else: print('NO')`. 

The program continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.

Correctness: **True**
