Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a positive integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[1] - ls[0]), b)`, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of at least 2 positive integers in ascending order, `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a` times the difference between the first two elements of `ls` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
