Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus one and is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `f` is a positive integer minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second and first elements of `ls` and `b`, `ls` is a list of at least 2 positive integers, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains a positive integer minus one and greater than 0, `n` remains a positive integer, `a` and `b` remain positive integers, `f` is reduced by the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second and first elements of `ls` and `b`, `ls` remains a list of at least 2 positive integers, `i` remains 1, and the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by two.
