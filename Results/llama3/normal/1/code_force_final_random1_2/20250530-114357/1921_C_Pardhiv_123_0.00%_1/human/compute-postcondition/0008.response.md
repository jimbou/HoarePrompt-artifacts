Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a positive integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[3] - ls[2]), b)`, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of at least 4 positive integers in ascending order, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated to be equal to `f - min(a * (ls[3] - ls[2]), b)`, which means it has been decreased by the minimum of `a * (ls[3] - ls[2])` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
