To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `ls`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `ls` has at least 2 elements (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(ls)`). 

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of at least 2 positive integers in ascending order, `i` is 1**
