#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the integers in the second line are positive integers in ascending order.
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, len(ls)):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is 0, stdin is empty, n is a positive integer, a and b are positive integers, ls is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, i is n-1, f is a positive integer minus the minimum of a times the difference between consecutive elements of ls and b for all pairs of consecutive elements in ls. If the final value of f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if f is less than or equal to 0, 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. The function then calculates the minimum of a times the difference between consecutive elements and b for all pairs of consecutive elements in the list of integers. If the final value of f is greater than 0, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.
