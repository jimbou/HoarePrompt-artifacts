Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the integers in the second line are positive integers in ascending order.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first test case, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one, since one test case has been read. The rest of the test cases remain the same, with each test case consisting of two lines: the first line contains four space-separated integers (n, f, a, and b), and the second line contains n space-separated integers in ascending order.
