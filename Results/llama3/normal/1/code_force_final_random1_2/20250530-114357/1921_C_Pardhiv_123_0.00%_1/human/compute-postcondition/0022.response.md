The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and ls, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and ls.  If the list has at least 3 elements and i is less than the length of the list the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, ls has at least 2 elements, i is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer minus one and is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `f` is a positive integer minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second and first elements of `ls` and `b`, `ls` is a list of at least 3 positive integers, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
