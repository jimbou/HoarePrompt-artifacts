Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus three and is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of `n` positive integers, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six, `f` is a positive integer minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between consecutive elements of `ls` and `b` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `ls`. If the final value of `f` is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `f` is less than or equal to 0, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has decreased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The program still has multiple test cases to process, and the value of `f` is still dependent on the minimum of `a` times the difference between consecutive elements of `ls` and `b` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `ls`. The program will print 'YES' if `f` is greater than 0, and 'NO' otherwise.
