Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`. If the current value of `f` is a positive integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[n-1] - ls[n-2]), b)`, and the current value of `f` is greater than 0, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `f` is less than or equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed.***
