Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a positive integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[n-1] - ls[n-2]), b)`, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `f` will be the result of subtracting the minimum between `a` times the difference between the last two elements of the list `ls` and `b` from the initial value of `f`. The other variables remain unchanged.
