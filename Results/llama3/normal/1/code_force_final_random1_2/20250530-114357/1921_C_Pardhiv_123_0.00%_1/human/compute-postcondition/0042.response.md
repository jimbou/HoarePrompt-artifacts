Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus two and is greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of at least 4 positive integers, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five, `f` is a positive integer minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second and first elements of `ls` and `b`, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the third and second elements of `ls` and `b`, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the fourth and third elements of `ls` and `b`, ..., minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the nth and (n-1)th elements of `ls` and `b, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the fourth and third elements of `ls` and `b`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a` times the difference between the fourth and third elements of `ls` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
