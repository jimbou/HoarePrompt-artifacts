Output State: **t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the integers in the second line are positive integers in ascending order. n, f, a, and b are positive integers, ls is a list of n positive integers in ascending order.**

The code snippet reads two lines from stdin for a test case. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b, which are assigned to the variables n, f, a, and b, respectively. The second line contains n space-separated integers, which are converted to a list of integers and assigned to the variable ls. 

The values of n, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the integers in the list ls are positive integers in ascending order. The variable t remains unchanged as a positive integer. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one.
