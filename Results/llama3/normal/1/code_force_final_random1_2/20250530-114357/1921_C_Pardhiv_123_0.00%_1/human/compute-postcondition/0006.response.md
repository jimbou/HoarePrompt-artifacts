Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a positive integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[2] - ls[1]), b)`, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of at least 3 positive integers in ascending order, `i` is 2**

The value of `f` is updated by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[2] - ls[1])` and `b` from its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of `f` is now more specific, as it is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[2] - ls[1]), b)`, which is a more precise expression.
