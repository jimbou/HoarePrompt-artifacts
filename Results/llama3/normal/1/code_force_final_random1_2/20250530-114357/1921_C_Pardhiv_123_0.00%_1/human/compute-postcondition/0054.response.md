Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. The function then calculates the minimum of a times the difference between consecutive elements and b for all pairs of consecutive elements in the list of integers. If the final value of f is greater than 0, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input.**
