To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(ls)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `ls`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The length of the list `ls` is not explicitly stated, but since `i` is 2 and the loop is still executing, we know that `ls` must have at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `ls` must have at least 4 elements.

The other variables `t`, `stdin`, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a positive integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[2] - ls[1]), b)`, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of at least 4 positive integers in ascending order, `i` is 3**
