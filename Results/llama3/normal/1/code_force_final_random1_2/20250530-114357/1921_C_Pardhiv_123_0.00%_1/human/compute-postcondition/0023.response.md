Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus one and is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `f` is a positive integer minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second and first elements of `ls` and `b`, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the third and second elements of `ls` and `b`, `ls` is a list of at least 3 positive integers, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a` times the difference between the third and second elements of `ls` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
