Output State: `t` is a positive integer minus two and is greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of `n` positive integers, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five, `f` is a positive integer minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second and first elements of `ls` and `b`, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the third and second elements of `ls` and `b`, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the fourth and third elements of `ls` and `b`, ..., minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the nth and (n-1)th elements of `ls` and `b`, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second and first elements of `ls` and `b`, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the third and second elements of `ls` and `b`, ..., minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the (n-1)th and (n-2)th elements of `ls` and `b`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and stdin remain unchanged. The list `ls` still contains `n` positive integers, and `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`. The variable `f` has been updated to subtract the minimum of `a` times the difference between consecutive elements of `ls` and `b` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `ls`.
