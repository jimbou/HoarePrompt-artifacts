Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the integers in the second line are positive integers in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
    ls = list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
    for i in range(1, len(ls)):
        f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
    if f > 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer minus one, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `i` is `n-1`. If the current value of `f` is a positive integer and is equal to `f - min(a * (ls[n-1] - ls[n-2]), b)`, and the current value of `f` is greater than 0, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `f` is less than or equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer minus two and is greater than 0, n is a positive integer, a and b are positive integers, ls is a list of n positive integers, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. The value of f is a positive integer minus the minimum of a times the difference between the second and first elements of ls and b, minus the minimum of a times the difference between the third and second elements of ls and b, minus the minimum of a times the difference between the fourth and third elements of ls and b, ..., minus the minimum of a times the difference between the nth and (n-1)th elements of ls and b. If f is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer minus three and is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `ls` is a list of `n` positive integers, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six, `f` is a positive integer minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between consecutive elements of `ls` and `b` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `ls`. If the final value of `f` is greater than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `f` is less than or equal to 0, 'NO' is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
