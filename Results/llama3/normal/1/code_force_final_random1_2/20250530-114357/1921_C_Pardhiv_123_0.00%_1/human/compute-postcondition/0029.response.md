Output: **t is a positive integer minus one and is greater than 0, n is a positive integer, a and b are positive integers, ls is a list of n positive integers, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The current value of f is a positive integer minus the minimum of a times the difference between the second and first elements of ls and b, minus the minimum of a times the difference between the third and second elements of ls and b, minus the minimum of a times the difference between the fourth and third elements of ls and b, ..., minus the minimum of a times the difference between the nth and (n-1)th elements of ls and b, and f is greater than 0, and 'YES' is printed**
