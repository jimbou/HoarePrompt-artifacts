To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(ls)):`. The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `ls`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `ls`. If `i` is less than the length of `ls`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `ls` is a list of at least 3 positive integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The length of `ls` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer minus one and is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `f` is a positive integer minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the second and first elements of `ls` and `b`, minus the minimum of `a` times the difference between the third and second elements of `ls` and `b`, `ls` is a list of at least 4 positive integers, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
