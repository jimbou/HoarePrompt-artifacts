Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `balance_info` is a list containing three elements `BalanceInfo(0, 0, s[0])`, `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])` and `BalanceInfo(balance, i+1, s[i+1])`, `i` is 3. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis "(", then `balance` is either -1 or 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis ")", then `balance` is either -3 or -1.**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been decremented by 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis "(", then `balance` is either -1 or 1, because it was either 0 or 2 before the decrement. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis ")", then `balance` is either -3 or -1, because it was either -2 or 0 before the decrement. The other variables remain unchanged.
