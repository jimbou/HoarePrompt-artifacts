Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, balance_info is an empty list, balance is 0**

The code initializes three new variables: `n`, `balance_info`, and `balance`. The first line assigns the length of the string `s` to `n`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, `n` will be a positive integer. The second line creates an empty list and assigns it to `balance_info`. The third line initializes `balance` to 0. The value of `s` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.
