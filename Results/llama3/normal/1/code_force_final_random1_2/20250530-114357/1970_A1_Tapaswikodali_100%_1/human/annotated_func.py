#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects of a class with two attributes: balance and position, both of which are integers.
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and the balance of infoB, where both balances are integers and are not equal to each other.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects of a class with two attributes: balance and position, both of which are integers. The balance of infoA is equal to the balance of infoB.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position of infoB and the position of infoA, where both infoA and infoB have the same balance.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares two objects, infoA and infoB, and returns the difference between either their balances if they are not equal, or their positions if their balances are equal.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence.

    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])` for `i` in range `n`, `i` is `n-1`. `balance` is 0.

    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: a string consisting of the characters from s in a sorted order based on their balance and position, ending with a closing parenthesis ")"

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input, sorts the characters based on their balance and position, and returns a string consisting of the sorted characters, ending with a closing parenthesis. The function does not modify the input string but instead creates a new sorted string. The output string is printed to the console.
