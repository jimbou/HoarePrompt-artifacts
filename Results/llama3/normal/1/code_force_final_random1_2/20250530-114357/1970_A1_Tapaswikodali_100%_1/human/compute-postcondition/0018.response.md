Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])` for `i` in range `n`, `i` is `n-1`. `balance` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is that the string `s` remains unchanged as a non-empty sequence of balanced parentheses, the length `n` of `s` is still the same, and the list `balance_info` now contains `n` elements, each representing the balance information at each index `i` of the string `s`. The loop variable `i` has reached the last index `n-1` of the string. The balance variable has returned to 0, indicating that the parentheses sequence is balanced.
