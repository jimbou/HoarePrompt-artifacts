The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `balance_info` is a list containing one element `BalanceInfo(0, 0, s[0])`, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis "(", then `balance` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis ")", then `balance` is -1.**
