Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `balance_info` is a list containing one element `BalanceInfo(0, 0, s[0])`, `balance` is 0, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the code has appended a new element to the `balance_info` list, which contains the current balance (0), the current index (0), and the character at index 0 in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
