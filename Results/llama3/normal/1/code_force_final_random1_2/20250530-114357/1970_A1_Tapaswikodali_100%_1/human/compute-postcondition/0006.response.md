Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `balance_info` is a list containing one element `BalanceInfo(0, 0, s[0])`, `balance` is -1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is ")"**

The code decreases the value of `balance` by 1. The initial value of `balance` is 0, so after the code is executed, `balance` becomes -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
