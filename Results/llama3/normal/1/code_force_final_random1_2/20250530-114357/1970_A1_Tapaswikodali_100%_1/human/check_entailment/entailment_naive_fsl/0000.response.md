Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the sorting of the balance_info list. The problem statement specifies that the columns of the table should be sorted in increasing order of prefix balance, breaking ties in decreasing order of position. However, the program sorts the list in increasing order of prefix balance, breaking ties in decreasing order of position, but it does not consider the original position of the characters in the input sequence.

For example, consider the input sequence "(()(()))". The correct balanced shuffle of this sequence is "(()(()))", but the program will output "(()(()))" which is not the correct result.

To fix this issue, the program should sort the balance_info list in increasing order of prefix balance, breaking ties in decreasing order of the original position of the characters in the input sequence. This can be achieved by modifying the sort function to use a custom key function that takes into account both the balance and the original position.

Here is an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.original_position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)
```

In this corrected code, the `BalanceInfo` class should have an additional attribute `original_position` that stores the original position of each character in the input sequence. The `sort` function then uses a custom key function that takes into account both the balance and the original position.
