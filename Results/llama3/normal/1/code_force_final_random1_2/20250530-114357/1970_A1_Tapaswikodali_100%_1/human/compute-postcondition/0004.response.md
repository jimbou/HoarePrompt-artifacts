Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `balance_info` is a list containing one element `BalanceInfo(0, 0, s[0])`, `balance` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis "("**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `s` still being a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and being a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` still being the length of `s` and greater than 0, `balance_info` still containing one element `BalanceInfo(0, 0, s[0])`, and `i` still being 0. The current character at index `i` in string `s` is still an opening parenthesis "(".
