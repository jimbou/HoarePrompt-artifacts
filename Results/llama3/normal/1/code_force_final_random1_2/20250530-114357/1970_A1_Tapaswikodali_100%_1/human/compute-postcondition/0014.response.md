Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `balance_info` is a list containing three elements `BalanceInfo(0, 0, s[0])`, `BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i])` and `BalanceInfo(balance, i+1, s[i+1])`, `i` is 3. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis "(", then `balance` is either 0 or 2. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis ")", then `balance` is either -2 or 0.**

In this output state, the code has appended a new element to the `balance_info` list, which contains the balance information at index `i+1` in the string `s`. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The balance information at index `i+1` is either 0 or 2 if the character at that index is an opening parenthesis, or -2 or 0 if the character is a closing parenthesis.
