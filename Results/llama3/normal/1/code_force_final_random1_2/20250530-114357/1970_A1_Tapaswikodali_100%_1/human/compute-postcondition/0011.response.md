Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `balance_info` is a list containing two elements `BalanceInfo(0, 0, s[0])` and `BalanceInfo(balance-1, i, s[i])`, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis "(", then `balance` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis ")", then `balance` is -2.**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been decremented by 1, so if the character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis "(", then `balance` is now 0, and if the character at index `i` in string `s` is a closing parenthesis ")", then `balance` is now -2. The other variables remain unchanged.
