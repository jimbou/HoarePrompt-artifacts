Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a positive integer greater than n+1, n is an integer, feat is a list of integers, f is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, array2 is an empty list, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if i == 0:
        if arr[0] < b / a:
            array2.append(arr[0] * a)
    elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list of integers, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, and `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is 0 and the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` contains one integer which is the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and the difference between the current element of `arr` at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, then `array2` contains the product of the difference between the current element of `arr` at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` and `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is an integer greater than `i+1`, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `arr[0]` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list of integers with an additional element equal to `arr[0] * a`. If `i` is greater than 0 and the difference between the ith and (i-1)th elements of `arr` is less than `b/a`, then `array2` is a list of integers with an additional element which is the product of the difference between the ith and (i-1)th elements of `arr` and `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is an integer greater than `i+2`, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than 1. If `i` is 0 and `arr[0]` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list of integers with an additional element equal to `arr[0] * a`. If `i` is greater than 0 and either `i` is 1 and `arr[0]` is less than `b/a`, or `i` is greater than 1 and the difference between the ith and (i-1)th elements of `arr` is less than `b/a`, then `array2` is a list of integers with an additional element which is the product of the difference between the ith and (i-1)th elements of `arr` and `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
