The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `test_cases`. If `i` is less than `test_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `test_cases` is greater than `n`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `n+1` and for the loop to execute again `test_cases` must be greater than `n+1`.
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers. `array2` contains elements which are the product of the difference between the current element at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` in `arr` and `a` if the difference between the current element at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the quotient of `b` divided by `a` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. stdin contains no input. If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
