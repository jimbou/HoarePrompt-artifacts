To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than n, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is an empty list, stdin contains no input.**
