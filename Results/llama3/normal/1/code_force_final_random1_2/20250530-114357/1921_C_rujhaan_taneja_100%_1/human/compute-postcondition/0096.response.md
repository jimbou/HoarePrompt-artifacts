Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is an integer, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, and `stdin` contains no input. The first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, and the difference between any two consecutive elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`. `array2` contains one integer which is the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a` if the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`. If the difference between any two consecutive elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, then `array2` contains the product of the difference between the two consecutive elements of `arr` and `a`. If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `b` and the difference between `n` and the length of `array2` is less than `f`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
