Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` equals `n`, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list of integers where each element is the product of the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` and `a` if the difference is less than `b` divided by `a`, otherwise `array2` is an empty list. The current value of the sum of `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`.***
