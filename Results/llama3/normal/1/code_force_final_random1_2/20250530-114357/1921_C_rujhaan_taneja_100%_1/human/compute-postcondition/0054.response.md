Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `n` is greater than `i` plus 2, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list that contains the product of the difference between the current element at index `i` plus 1 and the previous element at index `i` in `arr` and `a`**.

In this output state, the value of `array2` has been updated by appending the product of the difference between the current element at index `i` plus 1 and the previous element at index `i` in `arr` and `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
