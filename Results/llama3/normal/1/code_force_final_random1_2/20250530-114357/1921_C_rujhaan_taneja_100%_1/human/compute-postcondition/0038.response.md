Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers where the first element is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`, and the current value of `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `array2` has been updated to include the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. The first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, so the product is also less than `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
