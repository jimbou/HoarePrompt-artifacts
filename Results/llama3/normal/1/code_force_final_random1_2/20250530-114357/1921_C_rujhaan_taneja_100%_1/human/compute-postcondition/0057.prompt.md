Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a positive integer greater than n, i equals n+1, feat is a list of integers, f is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, array2 is an empty list, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if i == 0:
        if arr[0] < b / a:
            array2.append(arr[0] * a)
    elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers. If `i` is 0, `array2` contains one element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a` if the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `array2` contains one element which is the product of the difference between the current element at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` in `arr` and `a` if the difference between the current element at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the quotient of `b` divided by `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list. stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `n` is greater than `i` plus 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers. If `i` is 0, `array2` contains one element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a` if the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list. If `i` is not 0, `array2` contains one element which is the product of the difference between the current element at index `i` plus 1 and the previous element at index `i` in `arr` and `a` if the difference between the current element at index `i` plus 1 and the previous element at index `i` in `arr` is less than the quotient of `b` divided by `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `n` is greater than `i` plus 2, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers. If `i` is 0, then if the first element in `arr` is less than the quotient of `b` divided by `a`, `array2` is a list that contains one element which is the product of the first element in `arr` and `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list. If `i` is not 0, then if the difference between the current element at index `i` plus 1 and the previous element at index `i` in `arr` is less than the quotient of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` is a list that contains the product of the difference between the current element at index `i` plus 1 and the previous element at index `i` in `arr` and `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
