Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` equals 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list of integers where if the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, `array2` contains one element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`, otherwise `array2` is an empty list, stdin contains no input.**
