Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` equals `test_cases`, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list of integers where each element is the product of the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` and `a` if the difference is less than `b` divided by `a`, otherwise `array2` is an empty list. stdin contains no input. If the sum of `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` will be greater than or equal to 0, and the loop variable `i` will be equal to `test_cases`. The lists `feat`, `arr`, and `array2` will contain integers, and the variables `f`, `a`, and `b` will be integers. The standard input `stdin` will be empty. The loop will have processed all the test cases, and for each test case, it will have calculated the sum of the products of the differences between consecutive elements in `arr` and `a` if the differences are less than `b` divided by `a`. If this sum plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, the loop will have printed 'Yes'. Otherwise, it will have printed 'No'.
