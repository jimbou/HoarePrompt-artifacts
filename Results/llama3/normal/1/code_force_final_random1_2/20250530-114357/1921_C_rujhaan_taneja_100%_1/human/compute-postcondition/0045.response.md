The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. So `i` is not specified plus 1 and `n` is greater than `i` plus 1.
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `n` is greater than `i` plus 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers. If `i` plus 1 is 0, `array2` contains one element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a` if the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`. If `i` plus 1 is not equal to 0, `array2` contains one element which is the product of the difference between the current element at index `i` plus 1 and the previous element at index `i` in `arr` and `a` if the difference between the current element at index `i` plus 1 and the previous element at index `i` in `arr` is less than the quotient of `b` divided by `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list. stdin contains no input.**
