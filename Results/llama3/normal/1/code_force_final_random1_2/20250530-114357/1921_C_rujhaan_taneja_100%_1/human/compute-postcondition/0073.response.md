Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is not equal to 0, and the difference between the current element of `arr` at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`.**
