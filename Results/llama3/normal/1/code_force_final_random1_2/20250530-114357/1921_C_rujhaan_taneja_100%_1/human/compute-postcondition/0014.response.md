Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer increased by 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list containing the product of the first element of `arr` and `a` if the new value of `i` equals 0, otherwise `array2` contains the value of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` multiplied by `a` if the difference is less than the current value of `b` divided by `a`, otherwise `array2` remains an empty list, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `array2` has been updated based on the condition of the new value of `i`. If `i` equals 0, `array2` now contains the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `array2` contains the value of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` multiplied by `a` if the difference is less than the current value of `b` divided by `a`, otherwise `array2` remains an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
