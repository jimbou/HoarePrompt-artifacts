To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is a positive integer, which already ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect that it will start from 0.

State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is 0**
