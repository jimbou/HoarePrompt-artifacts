Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is not equal to 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list containing the value of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` multiplied by `a`. The value of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the current value of `b` divided by `a`, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `array2` has been updated by appending the product of the difference between the current element and the previous element in `arr` and the value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
