The code `array2.append(arr[0] * a)` appends a new element to the end of the list `array2`. This new element is the product of the first element of the list `arr` and the integer `a`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is an integer greater than `i+1`, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list of integers with an additional element equal to `arr[0] * a`, `i` is greater than 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `test_cases`, `n`, `feat`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `array2` now has an additional element at the end, which is the product of the first element of `arr` and the integer `a`.
