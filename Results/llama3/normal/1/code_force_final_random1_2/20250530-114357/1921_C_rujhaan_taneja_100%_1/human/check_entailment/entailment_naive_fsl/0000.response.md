Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the first message is sent at moment 0. In this case, the program does not account for the charge consumed by the phone being on from moment 0 to the moment the first message is sent. 

For example, if the input is:

1 10 1 5
0

The program will output "Yes", but the correct output should be "No" because the phone's charge will drop to 0 at moment 0, and Stepan will not be able to send the message. 

The program should be modified to handle this edge case.
