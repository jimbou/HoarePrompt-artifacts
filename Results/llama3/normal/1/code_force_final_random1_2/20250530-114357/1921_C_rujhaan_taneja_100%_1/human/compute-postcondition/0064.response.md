Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers. `array2` contains elements which are the product of the difference between the current element at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` in `arr` and `a` if the difference between the current element at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the quotient of `b` divided by `a` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. stdin contains no input. If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
