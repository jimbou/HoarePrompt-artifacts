Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is an integer greater than `i+1`, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list of integers with an additional element which is the product of the difference between the ith and (i-1)th elements of `arr` and `a`, `i` is greater than 0**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `array2`, which has an additional element appended to it. This new element is calculated as the product of the difference between the ith and (i-1)th elements of `arr` and the value of `a`.
