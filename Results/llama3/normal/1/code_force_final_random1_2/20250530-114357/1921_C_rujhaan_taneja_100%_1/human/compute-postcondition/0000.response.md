The code `test_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `test_cases`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines of input, the first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b.

After executing the code, the value of `test_cases` will be the number of test cases, which is a positive integer. The stdin will now contain the remaining input, which includes the first line of the first test case, containing four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers.**
