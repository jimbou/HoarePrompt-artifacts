Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is not equal to 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is an empty list, stdin contains no input. The current value of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the current value of `b` divided by `a`.***
