Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is an integer greater than `i+1`, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than 0. If `arr[0]` is less than `b/a`, `array2` is a list of integers with an additional element equal to `arr[0] * a`.***
