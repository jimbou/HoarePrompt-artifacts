Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, and `stdin` contains no input. If the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` contains one integer which is the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`.***
