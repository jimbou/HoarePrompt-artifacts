Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers. `array2` contains elements which are the product of the difference between the current element at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` in `arr` and `a` if the difference between the current element at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the quotient of `b` divided by `a` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be such that `array2` will contain products of differences between consecutive elements in `arr` and `a` if these differences are less than `b/a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
