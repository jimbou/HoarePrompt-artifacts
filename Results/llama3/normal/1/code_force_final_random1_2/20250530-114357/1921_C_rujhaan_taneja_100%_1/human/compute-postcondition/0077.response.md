The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is an integer greater than `i+1`, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than 0**
