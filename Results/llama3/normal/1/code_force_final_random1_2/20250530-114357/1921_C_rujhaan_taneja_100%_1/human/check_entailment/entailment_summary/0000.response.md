Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of messages `n`, the initial phone charge `f`, the charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially `b`. It also reads the moments at which messages need to be sent, stored in the array `arr`.
2.  The program then calculates the charge spent for each message. If the time difference between two consecutive messages is less than `b/a`, it calculates the charge spent as the product of the time difference and `a`. Otherwise, it considers the charge spent as `b` (because turning off and on is more efficient in this case).
3.  The program sums up the charge spent for all messages and checks if it is less than the initial phone charge `f`. If it is, the program prints "Yes", indicating that Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone. Otherwise, it prints "No".

Correctness: **True**
