Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `n` is greater than `i` plus 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers. If the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, `array2` contains one element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.***
