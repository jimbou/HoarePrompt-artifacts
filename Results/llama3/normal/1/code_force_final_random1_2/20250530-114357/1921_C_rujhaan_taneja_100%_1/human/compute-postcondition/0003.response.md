The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is 0 and n is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is an empty list, stdin contains no input**
