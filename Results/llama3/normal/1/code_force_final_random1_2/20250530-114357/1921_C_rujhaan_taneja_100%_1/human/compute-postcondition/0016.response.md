Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer increased by 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list containing the value of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` multiplied by `a` if the difference is less than the current value of `b` divided by `a`, otherwise `array2` remains an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `array2` is updated by appending the difference between the current element and the previous element in `arr`, multiplied by `a`, but only if this difference is less than `b` divided by `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
