Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `n` is greater than `i` plus 2, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list that contains one element which is the product of the first element in `arr` and `a`.**

In this output state, the values of `test_cases`, `n`, `feat`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged. However, `array2` now contains one element, which is the product of the first element in `arr` and `a`. This is because the code appends the product of the first element in `arr` and `a` to `array2`, regardless of the condition that was previously applied to `array2`.
