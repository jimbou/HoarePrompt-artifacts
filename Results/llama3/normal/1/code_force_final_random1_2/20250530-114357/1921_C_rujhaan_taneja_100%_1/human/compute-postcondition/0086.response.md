Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is an integer greater than `i+2`, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than 1, `array2` is a list of integers with an additional element which is the product of the difference between the ith and (i-1)th elements of `arr` and `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `array2`, which now has an additional element. This additional element is the product of the difference between the current and previous elements of `arr` and the value of `a`.
