The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. 
State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer increased by 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers. If the new value of `i` equals 0, `array2` is a list of integers where if the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, `array2` contains one element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`, otherwise `array2` is an empty list. If the new value of `i` is not equal to 0, `array2` is a list containing the value of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` multiplied by `a` if the difference is less than the current value of `b` divided by `a`, otherwise `array2` remains an empty list. stdin contains no input.**
