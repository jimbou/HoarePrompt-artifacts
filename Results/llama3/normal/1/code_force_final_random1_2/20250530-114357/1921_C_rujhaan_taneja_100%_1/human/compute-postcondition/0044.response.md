Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers. If `i` is 0, `array2` contains one element which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a` if the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `array2` contains one element which is the product of the difference between the current element at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` in `arr` and `a` if the difference between the current element at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the quotient of `b` divided by `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list. stdin contains no input.***
