Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is an integer greater than `i+2`, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is greater than 1, `array2` is a list of integers with an additional element equal to `arr[0] * a`.**

The code appends a new element to `array2`, which is the product of the first element of `arr` and `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the condition for `array2` is updated to reflect the new element.
