Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(0, n):
        if i == 0:
            if arr[0] < b / a:
                array2.append(arr[0] * a)
        elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` equals `n`, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list of integers where each element is the product of the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` and `a` if the difference is less than `b` divided by `a`, otherwise `array2` is an empty list. stdin contains no input. If the sum of `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers. `array2` contains elements which are the product of the difference between the current element at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` in `arr` and `a` if the difference between the current element at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the quotient of `b` divided by `a` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. stdin contains no input. If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `n` minus the length of `array2` and `b` is less than `f`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is an integer, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, and `stdin` contains no input. The first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, and the difference between any two consecutive elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`. `array2` contains one integer which is the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a` if the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`. If the difference between any two consecutive elements of `arr` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, then `array2` contains the product of the difference between the two consecutive elements of `arr` and `a`. If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of `b` and the difference between `n` and the length of `array2` is less than `f`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
