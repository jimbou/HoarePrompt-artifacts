Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer increased by 1, `feat` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than the new value of `i`, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is less than the current value of `b` divided by `a`, `array2` is a list containing the value of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` multiplied by `a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains an empty list.**
