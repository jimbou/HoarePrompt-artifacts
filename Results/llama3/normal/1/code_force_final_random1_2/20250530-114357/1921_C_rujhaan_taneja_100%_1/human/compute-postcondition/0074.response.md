Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n+1`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list containing the product of the difference between the current element of `arr` at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` and `a`, `i` is not equal to 0, and the difference between the current element of `arr` at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` is less than the ratio of `b` to `a`, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `array2` has been updated by appending the product of the difference between the current element of `arr` at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` and `a`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The difference between the current element of `arr` at index `i` and the previous element at index `i-1` is still less than the ratio of `b` to `a`. There is no input in `stdin`.
