The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `test_cases`. If `i` is less than `test_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `test_cases` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `test_cases` must be greater than `i`. 

State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `i` equals `n+1`, `feat` is a list of integers, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `array2` is a list of integers where each element is the product of the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` and `a` if the difference is less than `b` divided by `a`, otherwise `array2` is an empty list. stdin contains no input.**
