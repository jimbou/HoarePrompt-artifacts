This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of two lines of input: the first line contains four integers (n, f, a, and b), and the second line contains n integers in ascending order. The function calculates the sum of the products of the differences between consecutive integers in the second line and 'a', but only if the difference is less than 'b' divided by 'a'. If the sum of these products plus the product of 'n' minus the number of products and 'b' is less than 'f', it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function repeats this process for each test case and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
