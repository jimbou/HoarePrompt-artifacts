Output State: **encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, r is a string of unique lowercase Latin letters in ascending order, mapping is a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of a lowercase Latin letter and its corresponding reversed mapping.**

Explanation:
The first line of code sorts the unique characters in the `encoded` string in ascending order and assigns the result to the variable `r`. This means that `r` will contain a string of unique lowercase Latin letters in ascending order.

The second line of code creates a dictionary `mapping` where each key-value pair consists of a lowercase Latin letter and its corresponding reversed mapping. The dictionary comprehension iterates over the indices `i` of the string `r`, and for each index, it maps the character at that index to the character at the corresponding reversed index (`-(i + 1)`). This means that the first character in `r` will be mapped to the last character, the second character will be mapped to the second-to-last character, and so on.

Note that the `encoded` variable is not modified by the code, so its value remains the same. The `r` variable is assigned a new value, which is a sorted string of unique lowercase Latin letters. The `mapping` variable is also assigned a new value, which is a dictionary containing the reversed mappings of the characters in `r`.
