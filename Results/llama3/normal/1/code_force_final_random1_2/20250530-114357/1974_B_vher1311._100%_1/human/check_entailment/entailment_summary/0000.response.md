Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string `b`. Then, it creates a mapping of each character in `r` to its corresponding symmetric character. Finally, it uses this mapping to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding decoded character. The decoded string is then returned.

Correctness: **True**
