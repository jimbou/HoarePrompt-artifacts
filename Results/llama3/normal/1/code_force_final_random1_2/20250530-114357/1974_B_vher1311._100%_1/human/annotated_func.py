#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a string of lowercase Latin letters where each character is the corresponding reversed mapping of the characters in the encoded string, as defined in the mapping dictionary.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reverses the order of unique characters in a given string of lowercase Latin letters and returns the modified string, where each character is replaced by its corresponding reversed mapping.
