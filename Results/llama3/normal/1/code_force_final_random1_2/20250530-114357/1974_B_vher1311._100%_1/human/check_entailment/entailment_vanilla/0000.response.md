Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of decoding a given string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves replacing each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the input data, including the number of test cases `t` and the length of the encoded string `n`, followed by the encoded string `b` itself.
2.  For each test case, the program defines a function `func_1` that takes the encoded string `b` as input.
3.  Within `func_1`, the program creates a new string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string `b` in alphabetical order. This is done using the `sorted` and `set` functions.
4.  The program then creates a mapping dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character. This is achieved by iterating over the indices of `r` and mapping each character to the character at the corresponding index from the end of `r`.
5.  Finally, the program uses this mapping dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric character, effectively decoding the string. The decoded string is then returned as the result.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It accurately implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
