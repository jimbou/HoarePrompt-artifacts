Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The `func_1` function takes the encoded string `b` as input and first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in `b` in alphabetical order.
2. It then creates a mapping dictionary `mapping` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character (i.e., the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`).
3. Finally, it uses a generator expression to iterate over each character in the encoded string `b` and replaces it with its corresponding symmetric character from `r` using the `mapping` dictionary.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Strings with duplicate characters
* Strings with characters that are not present in the original string `s`
* Strings with a single character
* Strings with multiple characters

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the input string `b` is empty.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
