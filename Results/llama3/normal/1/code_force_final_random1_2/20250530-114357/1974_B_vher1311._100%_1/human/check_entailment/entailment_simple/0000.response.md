Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string `b`. Then, it creates a mapping dictionary that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character. Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string `b` and returns the original string `s`.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`. It then calls the function `func_1` with the encoded string `b` as an argument and appends the result to the `results` list. Finally, it prints the decoded strings for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
