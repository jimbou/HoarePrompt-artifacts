Reasoning:

The given program is designed to decode a string that was previously encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

The provided function `func_1` correctly reverses this encoding process. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. `r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))`: This line creates a new string `r` that contains all unique characters from the encoded string `encoded`, in alphabetical order. This is the same process used to create the auxiliary string `r` in the encoding algorithm.

2. `mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}`: This line creates a dictionary `mapping` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character. The symmetric character of a character at index `i` in `r` is the character at index `-i-1` (i.e., the character at the same distance from the end of the string).

3. `return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)`: This line uses the `mapping` dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character, effectively decoding the string.

Since the function correctly reverses the encoding process, it should produce the original string `s` from the encoded string `b`.

Correctness: **True**
