Output: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, the current value of `j` is `n`, the current value of `i` is 0, the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `r`, which is 0, and the character at index `i` in `s` is '>', and this is printed: `n - i` which is `n` because `i` is 0**
