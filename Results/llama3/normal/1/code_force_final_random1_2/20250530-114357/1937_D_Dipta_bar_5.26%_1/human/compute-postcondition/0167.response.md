Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 3, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 2, r is decreased by 1, a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)**

The code snippet modifies the value of variable `b`. The first line subtracts the value of `B[r - l]` from `b`, and the second line further subtracts the product of `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` and `(r - l)` from `b`. The final value of `b` is the result of these two subtractions. All other variables remain unchanged.
