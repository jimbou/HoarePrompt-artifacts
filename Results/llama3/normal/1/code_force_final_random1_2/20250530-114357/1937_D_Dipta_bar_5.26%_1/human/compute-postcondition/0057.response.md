Postcondition: ***s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 1, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 0, l is less than r, r is the length of B, the character at index i in s is '>', a is the integer at index l in A, x is the integer equal to r - (l + 2), and b is the integer at index r - 1 in B. If x is greater than or equal to 0, b is updated to be the integer at index r - 1 in B minus B[x] minus (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1).***
