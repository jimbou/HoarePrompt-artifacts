Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list.**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', the length of `s` is the number of these characters. The second line initializes an empty list `A`. The third line initializes an empty list `idx_A`. 

After executing the entire code block, the state of the variables is as follows: `s` remains unchanged as a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is now the length of `s`, `A` is an empty list, and `idx_A` is also an empty list.
