Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers and its length is larger than 0 and its last element is 0, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is larger than 0, `j` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still consists of '<' and '>' characters, and its length `n` is still greater than 0. The list `A` remains unchanged, and the list of indices `idx_A` for '>' characters in `s` is also unchanged. The list `B` now has an additional element, which is 0, and its length is larger than 0. The list of indices `idx_B` for '<' characters in `s` is still unchanged and its length is larger than 0. The variable `j` is still 1, and the variable `i` is still `n - 2`.
