Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is larger than 0, `j` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx_B` has been appended with `n - 2` and the last element of `B` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B).**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged. The lists `A` and `idx_A` are also unchanged. The list `idx_B` has been updated by appending the index `n - 2`. The list `B` has been updated such that its last element is calculated based on the last element of `idx_B` and the length of `idx_B`. The variables `j` and `i` remain unchanged.
