Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 3, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 2, r is decreased by 1, a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is B[r].**

The code snippet modifies the values of variables `a` and `b` by assigning them new values based on the existing values of other variables. The first line assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to `a`. The second line increments the value of `a` by the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `l`. The third line assigns the value of `B[r]` to `b`. The values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `j`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged.
