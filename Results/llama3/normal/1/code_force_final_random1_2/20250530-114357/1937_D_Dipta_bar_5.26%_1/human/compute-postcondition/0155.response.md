Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 3, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 2, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r, b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r).**

The code snippet modifies the value of variable `b` by subtracting two values from it. The first line subtracts the value of `A[l - r - 1]` from `b`, and the second line subtracts the product of `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1])` and `(l - r)` from `b`. The initial value of `b` is `A[l - 1]`, so after the execution of the code, `b` becomes `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. No other variables are affected by the code.
