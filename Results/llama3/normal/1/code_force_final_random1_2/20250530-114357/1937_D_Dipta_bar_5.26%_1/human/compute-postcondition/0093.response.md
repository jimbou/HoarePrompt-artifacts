The code prints the result of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. Let's break down the values of the variables involved:

*   `n` is at least 1.
*   `i` is 0.
*   `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`.
*   `l` is larger than `r` and its current value is 0.

Since `l` is 0, `idx_A[l - 1]` is not a valid index because `l - 1` would be -1, which is out of range for the list `idx_A`. However, considering the context and the fact that `l` is larger than `r` and `l` is 0, it seems there might be an error in the problem statement or the code. Assuming the intention was to use `idx_A[l]` or `idx_A[0]` (since `l` is 0), we'll proceed with that assumption for the sake of providing an answer.

Given this assumption, the expression becomes `n - i + (i - idx_A[0]) * 2`.

*   `n - i` equals `n` because `i` is 0.
*   `i - idx_A[0]` equals `-idx_A[0]` because `i` is 0.

So, the expression simplifies to `n - 2 * idx_A[0]`.

Since `n` is at least 1 and `idx_A[0]` is the index of the first '>' character in `s`, the output depends on the value of `n` and the position of the first '>' character in `s`.

Output: **n - 2 \* idx\_A\[0\] (where n is at least 1 and idx\_A\[0\] is the index of the first '>' character in s)**
