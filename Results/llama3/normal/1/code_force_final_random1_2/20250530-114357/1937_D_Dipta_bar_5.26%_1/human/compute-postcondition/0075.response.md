Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 0, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is updated based on the condition `l < r`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition `l < r` is still being evaluated, and the values of `l` and `r` are updated accordingly. The rest of the variables, including `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `j`, and `i`, retain their initial values.
