Output: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1. The character at index `i` of `s` is '<'. The current value of `l` is 0. The current value of `r` is greater than or equal to the current value of `l`. and this is printed: "1 " (the index `i` plus 1, which is 1, is being printed)**
