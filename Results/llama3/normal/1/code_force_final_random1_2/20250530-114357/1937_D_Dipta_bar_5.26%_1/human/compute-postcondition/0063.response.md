Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is `print(n - i, end=' ')`.

From the precondition, we know that `n` is at least 1, and the current value of `i` is 0.

Therefore, the expression `n - i` will evaluate to `n - 0`, which is simply `n`.

Since `n` is at least 1, the value of `n - i` will be at least 1.

The `end=' '` argument in the print statement means that a space will be printed after the value of `n - i`.

So, the output will be the value of `n` (which is at least 1) followed by a space.

Output: **n (where n is at least 1)**
