Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is larger than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is `n-3`**

In this output state, the value of `i` is calculated as `n-3` because `j` is 2 and `i` is assigned the value of `n-1-j`. The other variables remain unchanged.
