Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 0, `l` is equal to `r`. If `r` is 0, then `n - i` which is `n` because `i` is 0 is printed. If `r` is not equal to 0, then `a` is equal to B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, `b` is equal to A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r. If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is updated to A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r), and `l` is greater than `r`. The expression a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) is printed.***
