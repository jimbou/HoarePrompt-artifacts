Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 3, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 2, `r` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `r` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
