Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 2, i is 2, A is a list with an additional element x, x is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between i and the last element of idx_A, and the length of idx_A.**

The code snippet provided modifies the list A by appending a new element x, which is calculated based on the last element of A, the difference between i and the last element of idx_A, and the length of idx_A. The value of x is the sum of the last element of A and the product of the difference between i and the last element of idx_A, and the length of idx_A. The variables s and n remain unchanged, and i remains equal to 2.
