Output: **(A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) * 2 + (B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l) * 2 + i + 1 (where A[l - 1] is the element at index l - 1 of the list A, i is 0, idx_A[l - 1] is the index of the '>' character in s at index l - 1, l is larger than 0, B[r] is the element at index r of the list B, idx_B[r] is the index of the '<' character in s at index r, and r is the length of B minus 1)**
