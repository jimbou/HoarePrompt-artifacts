Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is -1, l is 0, r is the length of B.**

The code snippet initializes two new variables, `l` and `r`, without modifying any existing variables. The value of `l` is set to 0, and the value of `r` is set to the length of list `B`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
