Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1. The character at index `i` of `s` is '<'. If the current value of `l` is 0, the index `i` plus 1, which is 1, is being printed. If the current value of `l` is larger than 0, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if the difference between the current value of `r` and the current value of `l` is less than 0. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. The value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is being printed.***
