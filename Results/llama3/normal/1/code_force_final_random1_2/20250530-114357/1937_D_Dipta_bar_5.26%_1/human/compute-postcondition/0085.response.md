Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 1, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 0, l is larger than 0, r is the length of B minus 1, a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l). The character at index i of s is '<'. The current value of l is less than or equal to the current value of r. The difference between the current value of r and the current value of l is greater than or equal to 0.**

The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `B[r - l]` and `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from it. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
