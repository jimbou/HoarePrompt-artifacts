The code prints the value of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. To calculate this value, we need to substitute the given values of the variables.

Since `i` is 0, `n - i` is equal to `n`. The value of `n` is at least 1, but its exact value is not specified.

The expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` can be simplified as follows:

* `i` is 0
* `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`
* `l` is 0
* Since `l` is larger than `r`, and `r` is 0, `l` must be at least 1
* Therefore, `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the first '>' character in `s`

Since `i` is 0, `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` is equal to `-idx_A[l - 1]`. The value of `idx_A[l - 1]` is not specified, but it is an index of a '>' character in `s`.

Therefore, the expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` is equal to `-2 * idx_A[l - 1]`.

Substituting these values into the original expression, we get:

`n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` = `n - 0 + (-2 * idx_A[l - 1])` = `n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]`

Since `n` is at least 1, and `idx_A[l - 1]` is an index of a '>' character in `s`, the value of `n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]` is not specified.

Output: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1 and its current value is 0. The character at index `i` of `s` is '<'. `l` is larger than `r`, and the value of `n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]` is being printed, where `n` is at least 1 and `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the first '>' character in `s`**
