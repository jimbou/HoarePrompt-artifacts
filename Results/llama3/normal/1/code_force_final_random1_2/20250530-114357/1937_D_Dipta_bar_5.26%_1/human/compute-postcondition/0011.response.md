Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `A` is a list containing the integer 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is still greater than 0, and the value of `i` is still 1. The code appends the integer 0 to the list `A`, so `A` now contains the integer 0.
