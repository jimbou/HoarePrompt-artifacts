Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the string `s` remains unchanged, the length of `s` is still `n`, and the list `A` contains integers that represent the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, multiplied by the length of the list `idx_A` at each iteration. The list `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
