Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1 and its current value is 0. The character at index `i` of `s` is '<'. `l` is larger than `r`***
