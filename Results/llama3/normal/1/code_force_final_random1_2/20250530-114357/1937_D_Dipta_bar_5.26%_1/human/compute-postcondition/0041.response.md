Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is larger than 0, `j` is 1. If `s[i]` is '<', then `i` is `n - 2`, `idx_B` has been appended with `n - 2` and the last element of `B` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B).***
