Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 3, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 2, a is A[2], x is r - 4, b is B[r - 1] - B[r - 4] - (idx_B[r - 4] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - 3)**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by subtracting the value of `B[x]` (which is `B[r - 4]`) and the product of `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1])` (which is `(idx_B[r - 4] - idx_B[r - 1])`) and `(x + 1)` (which is `(r - 3)`). All other variables remain unchanged.
