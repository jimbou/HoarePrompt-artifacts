Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is -1, l is 0, r is the length of B.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is increased by 1 and `r` is updated based on the condition `l < r`. If `s[i]` is '<', then `r` is the length of `B` minus 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the index `i` plus 1 is printed. If `l` is larger than 0, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if the difference between the current value of `r` and the current value of `l` is less than 0. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. The value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed. If `l` is larger than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value of `n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]` is printed. If `r` is not 0, then if `l - r - 1 > 0`, `a` is the last element of `B`, and `b` is the second last element of `A` minus the last element of `A` and minus the difference between the last index of '>' in `s` and the index of '>' in `s` at position `l - r - 2` times `l - r - 1`, plus the difference between the current index `i` and the index of '>' in `s` at position `l - 1` times `r + 1`. Otherwise, `b` is the second last element of `A` minus the last element of `A` and minus the difference between the last index of '>' in `s` and the index of '>' in `s` at position `l - r - 2` times `l - r - 1`. The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is `l+1`. If `l` is less than `r`, then if `r - 3` is greater or equal to 0, the value printed is 2 times the value of `A[1]` plus 2 times the value of `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)` plus 2. Otherwise, the value printed is 2 times the value of `A[1]` plus 2 times the value of `B[r - 1]` plus 2. If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value printed is `n-1`. Otherwise, the value printed is 2 times the value of `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r` plus 2 times the value of `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, otherwise 2 times the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, plus `n - i`. If `s[i]` is '<', then `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is 0, the value of `i + 1` which is 2 is printed. Otherwise, if `r - l` is greater or equal to 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and `i` is 1. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` equals 0, the printed value is `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. Otherwise, the printed value is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, where `a` is the value of `B` at index `r`, and `b` is the value of `A` at index `l - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`, or the value of `A` at index `l - 1` minus `A` at index `l - r - 2` and minus the product of the difference between `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `idx_A` at index `l - r - 2` and `l - r - 1`, depending on whether `l - r - 1` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 3, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is `l + 1`. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the value of `i + 1` which is 3 is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is less than 0. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and this is printed: 2 * (A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) + 2 * (B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l if r - l < 0. Otherwise, b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l) + i + 1. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value of `n` minus `i` plus the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` multiplied by 2 is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r]`, if `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is the result of subtracting `A[l - r - 2]` and the product of (`idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]`) and (`l - r - 1`) from the original value of `b` plus (`i - idx_A[l - 1]`) * (`r + 1`), otherwise, `b` remains unchanged plus (`i - idx_A[l - 1]`) * (`r + 1`), and `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
