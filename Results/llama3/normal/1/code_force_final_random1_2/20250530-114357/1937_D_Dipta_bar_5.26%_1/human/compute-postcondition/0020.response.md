Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `idx_A` contains an additional element `i` (which is 2)**

In this output state, the value of `idx_A` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables, `s` and `n`, remain unchanged. The list `A` is not directly affected by this code snippet, but its value can be determined based on the updated value of `idx_A`. If `idx_A` was empty, `A` would still contain only one element, 0. Otherwise, `A` would contain an additional element `x`, where `x` is the sum of the last element of `A`, the product of the difference between `i` (which is 2) and the last element of `idx_A`, and the length of `idx_A`.
