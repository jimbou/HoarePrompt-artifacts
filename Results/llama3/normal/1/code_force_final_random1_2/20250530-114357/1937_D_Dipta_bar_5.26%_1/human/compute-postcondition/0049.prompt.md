Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(0, n):
    i = n - 1 - j
    if s[i] == '<':
        if len(idx_B) == 0:
            B.append(0)
        else:
            x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
            B.append(x)
        idx_B.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is larger than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`. If the current value of `s[i]` is '<', the last element of `idx_B` is `n-1`. If the length of `idx_B` is 1, `B` contains a single element 0. Otherwise, the last element of `B` is x. If the current value of `s[i]` is '>', the postcondition is the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is larger than 0, `j` is 1. If `s[i]` is '<', then `i` is `n - 2`, `idx_B` has been appended with `n - 2` and the last element of `B` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is larger than 0 and contains `n-3` at the end, `j` is 2, `i` is `n-3`. If the length of `idx_B` is 0, `B` contains one more 0 at the end. Otherwise, `B` contains an additional element `x`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
