To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how the variables within it are updated.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, n):`. This means that the only variables we can adjust are `i` and `n`, as they are the ones directly involved in the loop condition.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`, which is 2.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

The other variables (`s`, `idx_A`, `A`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the purpose of determining whether the loop can execute again.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
