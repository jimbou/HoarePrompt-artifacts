Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` is a list of indices with an additional element `i` (which is 1), and if `idx_A` was empty, `A` is a list containing the integer 0, otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, which is the sum of the last element of `A` and the product of (`i` - the last index of `idx_A`) and the length of `idx_A`.***
