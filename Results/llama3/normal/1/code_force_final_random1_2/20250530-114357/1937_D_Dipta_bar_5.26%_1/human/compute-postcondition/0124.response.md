Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 1, and `r` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decreased by 1, but its initial value was not specified, so we cannot determine its exact value. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
