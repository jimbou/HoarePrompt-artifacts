Based on the precondition, let's break down the variables and their values:

* `a` is equal to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`.
* `b` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] * r`.
* `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', but its value is not explicitly given.
* `n` is at least 1, but its exact value is not given.
* `A` is a list of integers, but its values are not explicitly given.
* `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, but its values are not explicitly given.
* `B` is a list of integers, but its values are not explicitly given.
* `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s`, and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`.
* `j` is `n`, but its value is not used in the print statement.
* `i` is 0.
* `l` is equal to `r`, but since `l` is greater than `r`, this is a contradiction. However, since `l` is updated to `l - r - 1` when `l - r > 0`, we can assume that `l` is actually greater than `r` by at least 1.
* `r` is not equal to 0.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')`

* `a * 2` is equal to `2 * (B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r)`.
* `b * 2` is equal to `2 * (A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] * r)`.
* `n - i` is equal to `n - 0`, which is just `n`.

Since `l` is greater than `r`, the update to `b` is applied, and `b` becomes `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`.

Substituting the values, the print statement becomes:

`print(2 * (B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r) + 2 * (A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)) + n, end=' ')`

Output: **2 * (B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r) + 2 * (A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)) + n (where B, idx_B, A, idx_A, l, r, and n are the values described in the precondition)**
