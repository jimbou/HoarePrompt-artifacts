Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 1, r is decreased by 1, a is the value of B at index r, and b is the value of A at index l - 1.**

The code assigns the value of B at index r to a and the value of A at index l - 1 to b. The values of s, n, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, j, i, and r remain unchanged. The only new information is the values of a and b, which are determined by the values of B and A at specific indices.
