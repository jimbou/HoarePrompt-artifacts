Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 3, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 2, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r, b is A[l - 1].**

The code snippet assigns the value of `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` to `a`, and the value of `A[l - 1]` to `b`. The value of `a` depends on the values of `B[r - 1]`, `idx_B[r - 1]`, `i`, and `r`, while the value of `b` depends on the value of `A[l - 1]`. The values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.
