Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 1, if r - l is greater or equal to 0, r is decreased by 1, a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, and b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of b has been updated by adding the product of (idx_B[r] - i) and l to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition r - l >= 0 still affects the values of r, a, and b. If this condition is true, r is decreased by 1, and a and b are calculated based on the updated value of r. Otherwise, the values of r, a, and b remain the same as before.
