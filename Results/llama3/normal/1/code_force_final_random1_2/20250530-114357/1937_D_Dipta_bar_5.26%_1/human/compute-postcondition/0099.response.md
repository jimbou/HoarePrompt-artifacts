Postcondition: ***s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 1, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 0, r is the length of B minus 1. If l - r - 1 > 0, then l is greater than r plus 1, a is the last element of B, and b is the second last element of A minus the last element of A and minus the difference between the last index of '>' in s and the index of '>' in s at position l - r - 2 times l - r - 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
