Output State: **The loop finishes executing when `i` equals `n`. The value of `l` equals the number of '>' characters in `s`, and the value of `r` equals 0. The values of `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `s` also remains unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the index `i` will have reached the end of the string `s`, the counter `l` will have counted the total number of '>' characters in `s`, and the counter `r` will have reached 0. The lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B` and the variable `j` will retain their initial values, and the string `s` will also remain unchanged.
