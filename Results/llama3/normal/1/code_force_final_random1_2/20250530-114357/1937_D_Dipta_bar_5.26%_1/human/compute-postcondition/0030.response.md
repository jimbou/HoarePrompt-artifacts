Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers with the last element being x, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s, j is 0, i is n - 1, the current value of s[i] is '<', and the length of idx_B is larger than 0.**

The code snippet calculates a new value `x` based on the last element of list `B`, the last index of `idx_B`, and the current index `i`. This new value `x` is then appended to the end of list `B`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
