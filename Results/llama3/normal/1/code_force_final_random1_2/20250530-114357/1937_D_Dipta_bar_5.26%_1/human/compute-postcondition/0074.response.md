Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are updated based on the condition `l < r`. If `l < r`, then the expression `2 * a + 2 * b + 1` is printed, where `a` is the integer at index `l` in `A`, `b` is equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and `i` is 0. If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, `n` is printed. If `r` is not equal to 0, then the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed, where `a` is equal to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and if `l - r > 0`, then `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`.**
