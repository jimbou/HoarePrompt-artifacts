Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 1, `l` is `l+1`. If `l` is less than `r`, then if `r - 3` is greater or equal to 0, the value printed is 2 times the value of `A[1]` plus 2 times the value of `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)` plus 2. Otherwise, the value printed is 2 times the value of `A[1]` plus 2 times the value of `B[r - 1]` plus 2. If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value printed is `n-1`. Otherwise, the value printed is 2 times the value of `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r` plus 2 times the value of `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, otherwise 2 times the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, plus `n - i`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for printing values are still the same, but the value of `l` used in these conditions is now `l+1`.
