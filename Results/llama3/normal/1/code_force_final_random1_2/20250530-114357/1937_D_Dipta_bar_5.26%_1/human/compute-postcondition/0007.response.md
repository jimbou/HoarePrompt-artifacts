Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is '>'. If `idx_A` is empty, `A` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element x and `idx_A` is a list that is not empty.***
