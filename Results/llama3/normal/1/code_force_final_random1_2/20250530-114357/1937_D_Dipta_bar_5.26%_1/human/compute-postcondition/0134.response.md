The code prints the result of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. Let's break down the variables involved:

*   `n` is at least 2.
*   `i` is 1.
*   `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`.
*   `l` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on the context, it seems to be related to the index of the current '>' character being processed. However, since `l` is not defined, we will assume it is an index within the bounds of `idx_A`.

Given these values, we can substitute them into the expression:

*   `n - i` equals `n - 1`, which is at least 1 (since `n` is at least 2).
*   `i - idx_A[l - 1]` equals `1 - idx_A[l - 1]`, which is the difference between 1 and the index of a '>' character in `s`. This difference is then multiplied by 2.

The final output will be the sum of `n - 1` and twice the difference between 1 and the index of a '>' character in `s`.

Output: **n - 1 + 2 * (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) (where n is at least 2 and idx_A[l - 1] is the index of a '>' character in s)**
