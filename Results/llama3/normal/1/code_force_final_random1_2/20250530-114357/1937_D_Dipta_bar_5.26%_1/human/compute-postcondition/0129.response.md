Postcondition: ***s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 1, if r - l is greater or equal to 0, r is decreased by 1, a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, and b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l). Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
