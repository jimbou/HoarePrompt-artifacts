Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`. `j` is `n`, `i` is -1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has finished executing, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The string `s` and the list `A` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The list `idx_A` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The list `B` contains the final values calculated by the loop, and the list `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s`. The variable `j` has reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times, and the variable `i` has reached the value of -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
