The code prints the result of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`, where `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, and `idx_A[l - 1]` is the last index of '>' character in the string `s`. Since `l` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is the length of the list `idx_A`. The expression can be broken down as follows:

* `n - i` is the difference between `n` and `i`, which is at least 1 (since `n` is at least 3 and `i` is 2).
* `i - idx_A[l - 1]` is the difference between `i` and the last index of '>' character in the string `s`. Since `i` is 2, this expression will be at least 0 (if the last '>' character is at index 2 or higher) or negative (if the last '>' character is at index 1 or lower).
* `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` is twice the result of the previous expression.

Therefore, the output will be the result of adding `n - i` and `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`, which will be at least 1 (if the last '>' character is at index 2 or higher) or a negative number (if the last '>' character is at index 1 or lower).

Output: **at least 1 or a negative number (depending on the position of the last '>' character in the string s)**
