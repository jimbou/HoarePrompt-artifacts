Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list containing a single element 0, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the current value of `s[i]` is '<', and the length of `idx_B` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length `n` of `s` is still greater than 0, the list `A` of integers remains unchanged, the list `idx_A` of indices of '>' characters in `s` remains unchanged, the list `B` now contains a single element 0, the list `idx_B` is still empty, the variable `j` is still 0, the variable `i` is still `n - 1`, the current value of `s[i]` is still '<', and the length of `idx_B` is still 0.
