Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 3, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 2, r is decreased by 1, a is B[r], b is the result of subtracting A[l - r - 2] and the product of (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) and (l - r - 1) from the original value of b.**

In this output state, the values of s, n, A, idx_A, B, idx_B, j, i, r, and a remain unchanged from the initial state. The only variable affected by the code is b, which is updated by subtracting A[l - r - 2] and the product of (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) and (l - r - 1) from its original value.
