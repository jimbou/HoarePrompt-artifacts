Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 1, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is 0, the value of `i + 1` which is 2 is printed. Otherwise, if `r - l` is greater or equal to 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and `i` is 1. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` equals 0, the printed value is `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. Otherwise, the printed value is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, where `a` is the value of `B` at index `r`, and `b` is the value of `A` at index `l - 1` plus the product of the difference between `i` and `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `r + 1`, or the value of `A` at index `l - 1` minus `A` at index `l - r - 2` and minus the product of the difference between `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `idx_A` at index `l - r - 2` and `l - r - 1`, depending on whether `l - r - 1` is greater than 0.***
