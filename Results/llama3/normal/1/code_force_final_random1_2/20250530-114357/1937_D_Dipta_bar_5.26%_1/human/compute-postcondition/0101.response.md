The code prints the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, where `a` is the last element of list `B`, `b` is a calculated value based on the elements of list `A` and the indices of '>' characters in string `s`, and `n - i` is the difference between the value of `n` (which is at least 1) and the current index `i` (which is 0).

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated result.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) (where a is the last element of list B, b is a calculated value based on the elements of list A and the indices of '>' characters in string s, and n - i is the difference between the value of n and the current index i)**
