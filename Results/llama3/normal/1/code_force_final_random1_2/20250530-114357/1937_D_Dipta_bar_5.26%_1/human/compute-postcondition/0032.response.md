Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is larger than 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '<'. The last element of `idx_B` is `n-1`. If the length of `idx_B` is 1, `B` contains a single element 0. Otherwise, the last element of `B` is x.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still consists of '<' and '>' characters, and its length `n` is still greater than 0. The lists `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged. The list `idx_B` now has an additional element, which is the index `i` (equal to `n-1`), and its length is greater than 0. The value of `i` is still `n-1`, and the current character at index `i` in string `s` is still '<'. The list `B` still contains integers, and if `idx_B` has only one element, `B` contains a single element 0; otherwise, the last element of `B` is still x. The value of `j` remains 0.
