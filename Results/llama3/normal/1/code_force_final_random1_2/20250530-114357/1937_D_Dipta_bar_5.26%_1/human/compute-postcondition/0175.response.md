Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 3, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 2, r is decreased by 1, a is B[r], b is A[l - 1].**

In this output state, the values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only changes are the introduction of two new variables, `a` and `b`, which are assigned the values of `B[r]` and `A[l - 1]`, respectively. The value of `r` is also updated to be decreased by 1.
