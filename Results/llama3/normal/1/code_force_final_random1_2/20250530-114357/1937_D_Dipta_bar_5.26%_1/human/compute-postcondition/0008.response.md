Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `idx_A` is a list that is not empty and contains the element 0, and if `idx_A` was empty, `A` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element x.**

In this output state, the value of `idx_A` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `s[i]` is '>' is still valid, and the properties of `n`, `s`, and `A` are preserved.
