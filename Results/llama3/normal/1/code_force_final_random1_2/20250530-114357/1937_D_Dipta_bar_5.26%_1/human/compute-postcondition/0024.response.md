The only variables in the loop head are variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and j is now 0. 
State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list, j is 0**
