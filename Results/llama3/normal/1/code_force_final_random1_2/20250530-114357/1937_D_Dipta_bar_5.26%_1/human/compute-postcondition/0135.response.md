The code prints the value of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`, where `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `idx_A[l - 1]` is the last index of '>' character in `s`.

Since the exact value of `idx_A[l - 1]` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: ** `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 1, and `r` is decreased by 1, and this is printed: `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` (where `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `idx_A[l - 1]` is the last index of '>' character in `s`)**
