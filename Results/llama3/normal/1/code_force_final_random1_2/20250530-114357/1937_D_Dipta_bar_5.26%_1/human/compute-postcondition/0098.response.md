Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 1, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 0, l is greater than r plus 1, r is the length of B minus 1, a is the last element of B, b is the second last element of A minus the last element of A and minus the difference between the last index of '>' in s and the index of '>' in s at position l - r - 2 times l - r - 1.**

The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting the last element of `A` and the difference between the last index of '>' in `s` and the index of '>' in `s` at position `l - r - 2` times `l - r - 1` from the second last element of `A`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
