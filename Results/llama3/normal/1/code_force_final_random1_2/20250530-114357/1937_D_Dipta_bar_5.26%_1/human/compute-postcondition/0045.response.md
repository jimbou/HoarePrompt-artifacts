Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and must be greater than 2, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers with an additional element x, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is larger than 0, j is 2, i is n-3**

The code calculates a new value `x` based on the last element of `B`, the last index of `idx_B`, and the value of `i`. This new value `x` is then appended to the end of list `B`. The length of `B` increases by 1, but the lengths of `idx_A` and `idx_B` remain unchanged. The values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `j`, and `i` are not affected by the code.
