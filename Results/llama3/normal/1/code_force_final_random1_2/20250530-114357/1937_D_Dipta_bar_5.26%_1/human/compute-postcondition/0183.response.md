Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 3, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '>', then `l` is `l + 1`. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the value of `i + 1` which is 3 is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is less than 0. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and this is printed: 2 * (A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) + 2 * (B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l if r - l < 0. Otherwise, b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l) + i + 1. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value of `n` minus `i` plus the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` multiplied by 2 is printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r]`, if `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is the result of subtracting `A[l - r - 2]` and the product of (`idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]`) and (`l - r - 1`) from the original value of `b` plus (`i - idx_A[l - 1]`) * (`r + 1`), otherwise, `b` remains unchanged plus (`i - idx_A[l - 1]`) * (`r + 1`), and `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed.***
