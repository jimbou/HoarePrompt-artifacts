Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` is a list that contains the element 0 and if `idx_A` was empty, `A` is a list containing a single element 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element x. If `s[i]` is '<', no changes are made to `A` and `idx_A`.***
