Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 1, a is A[1], x is r - 3, if x is greater or equal to 0, b is (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1). Otherwise, b is B[r - 1].**

In this output state, the value of b has been updated based on the given condition. If x is greater or equal to 0, b is now calculated as (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1), otherwise, it remains B[r - 1]. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
