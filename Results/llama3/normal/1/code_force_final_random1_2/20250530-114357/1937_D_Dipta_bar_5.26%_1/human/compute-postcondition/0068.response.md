Output State: **a is equal to B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is equal to A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r), s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 1, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 0, l is equal to r, and r is not equal to 0. Additionally, the current value of l is greater than r.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by subtracting `A[l - r - 1]` and `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its original value `A[l - 1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
