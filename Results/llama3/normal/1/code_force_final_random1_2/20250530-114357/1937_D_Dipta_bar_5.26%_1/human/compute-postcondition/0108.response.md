Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 1, a is A[1], x is r - 3, b is B[r - 1] - B[r - 3] - (idx_B[r - 3] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - 2)**

The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting the value of `B[x]` and then subtracting the product of `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1])` and `(x + 1)`. The value of `x` is `r - 3`, so `B[x]` is `B[r - 3]`. The value of `idx_B[x]` is `idx_B[r - 3]` and the value of `idx_B[r - 1]` is `idx_B[r - 1]`. The value of `x + 1` is `r - 2`. Therefore, the final value of `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - 3] - (idx_B[r - 3] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - 2)`.
