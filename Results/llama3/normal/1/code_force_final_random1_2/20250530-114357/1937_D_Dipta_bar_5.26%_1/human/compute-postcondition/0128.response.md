Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 1, r is decreased by 1, a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, and b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l).**

The code snippet modifies the value of variable `b` by subtracting the value of `B[r - l]` and the product of `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` and `(r - l)` from it. The initial value of `b` is `B[r]`. After the first line, `b` becomes `B[r] - B[r - l]`. The second line further modifies `b` by subtracting the product of `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` and `(r - l)` from it, resulting in the final value of `b` as `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
