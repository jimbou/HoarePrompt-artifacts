Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 3, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 2, `r` is decreased by 1. If `l` is 0, the value of `i + 1` which is 3 is printed. Otherwise, a is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, b is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is less than 0. Otherwise, b is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and this is printed: 2 * (A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) + 2 * (B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l if r - l < 0. Otherwise, b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l) + i + 1.**
