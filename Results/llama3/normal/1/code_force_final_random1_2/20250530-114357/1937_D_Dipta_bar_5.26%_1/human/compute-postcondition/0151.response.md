Output: ** `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 3, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 2, `a` is `A[2]`, `x` is `r - 4`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` which is `2 * A[2] + 2 * ((idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)) + 2 + 1`**
