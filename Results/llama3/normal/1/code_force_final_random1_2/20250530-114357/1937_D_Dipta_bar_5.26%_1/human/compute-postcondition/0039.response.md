Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is larger than 0, `j` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`. If `idx_B` is empty, the last element of `B` is 0. Otherwise, the last element of `B` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B) + (i - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`.

In this output state, the value of `idx_B` has been updated by appending the value of `i` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of `idx_B` is now larger than before, and its last element is `i`. The last element of `B` has also been updated based on the new value of `idx_B`.
