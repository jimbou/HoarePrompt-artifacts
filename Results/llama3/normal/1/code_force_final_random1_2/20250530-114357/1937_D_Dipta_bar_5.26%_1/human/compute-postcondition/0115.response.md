Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 1, a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r, b is A[l - 1].**

The code snippet assigns values to variables `a` and `b` based on the values of other variables. The value of `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, where `B[r - 1]` is an integer from list `B`, `idx_B[r - 1]` is an index of a '<' character in string `s`, `i` is 1, and `r` is not specified but is used in the calculation. The value of `b` is simply `A[l - 1]`, which is an integer from list `A`. The values of `s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.
