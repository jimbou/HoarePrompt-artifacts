Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated based on the given expression. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The new value of `b` is a combination of its previous value and the additional term `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, the previous value of `b` was `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`, and if `l - r <= 0`, the previous value of `b` was `A[l - 1]`.
