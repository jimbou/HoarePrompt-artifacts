Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 3, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 2. If `l` is less than `r`, then `a` is `A[2]`, `x` is `r - 4`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` which is `2 * A[2] + 2 * ((idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)) + 2 + 1`. If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value of `n - i` which is equal to `n - 2` is being printed. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Otherwise, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. and this is printed: `2 * (B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r) + 2 * (If l - r > 0, then A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r. Otherwise, A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r) + (n - 2)**
