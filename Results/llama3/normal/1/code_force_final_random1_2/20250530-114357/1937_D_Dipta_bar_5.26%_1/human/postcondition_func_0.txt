This function takes a string `s` consisting of '<' and '>' characters as input and prints a sequence of numbers. The function calculates the numbers based on the indices of '<' and '>' characters in the string and their corresponding counts. It iterates through the string, maintaining two pointers `l` and `r` to track the number of '>' and '<' characters encountered so far. For each character, it calculates a value based on the current indices, counts, and previous values, and prints this value. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated sequence of numbers. The input string `s` remains unchanged throughout the execution.
