Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers and its length is larger than 0 and it contains one more 0 at the end, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is larger than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is `n-3`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `B` now contains one more element, which is 0, at the end. The other variables remain unchanged.
