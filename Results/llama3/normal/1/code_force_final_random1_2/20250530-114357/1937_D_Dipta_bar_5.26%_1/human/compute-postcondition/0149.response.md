Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 3, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 2, `a` is `A[2]`, `x` is `r - 4`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`**.

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`, which is calculated using the current values of `idx_B[r - 1]`, `i` (which is 2), and `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
