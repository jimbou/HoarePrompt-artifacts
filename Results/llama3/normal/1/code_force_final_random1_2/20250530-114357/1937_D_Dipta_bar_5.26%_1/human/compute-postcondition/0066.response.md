Output State: **a is equal to B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is equal to A[l - 1], s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 1, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 0, l is equal to r, and r is not equal to 0.**

The code assigns the value of `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` to `a` and the value of `A[l - 1]` to `b`. Since `r` is not equal to 0, and `i` is 0, `a` becomes `B[r - 1] + idx_B[r - 1] * r`. The value of `b` is `A[l - 1]`. No other variables are affected.
