Output State: **`a` is equal to B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, `b` is equal to A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r, `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 0, `l` is equal to `r`, and `r` is not equal to 0. If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is updated to A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r), and `l` is greater than `r`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the additional term `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the relationships between `l`, `r`, and the other variables are still valid.
