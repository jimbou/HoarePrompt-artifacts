Output: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 3, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 2, `r` is decreased by 1, and this is printed: the value of `n` minus `i` plus the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` multiplied by 2**
