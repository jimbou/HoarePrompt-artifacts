To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is larger than 0, `j` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`**
