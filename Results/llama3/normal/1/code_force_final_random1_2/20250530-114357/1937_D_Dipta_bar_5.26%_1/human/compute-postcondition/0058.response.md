Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 0, `l` is less than `r`, `r` is the length of `B`, the character at index `i` in `s` is '>', `a` is the integer at index `l` in `A`, `x` is the integer equal to `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be the product of the difference between the index of the last '<' character in `s` and the current index `i`, and the value of `l` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
