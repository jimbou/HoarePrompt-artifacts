Based on the given precondition, let's break down the variables and their values:

* `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r`. Since `r` is not explicitly defined, we can't determine the exact value of `a`. However, we can describe it as `a` is the value of the element at index `r-1` in list `B`, plus the product of the difference between the index of the '>' character at index `r-1` in list `idx_B` and 2, and the value of `r`.
* `b` has two possible values depending on the condition `l - r > 0`. If true, `b` is calculated as `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If false, `b` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. Since `l` and `r` are not explicitly defined, we can't determine the exact value of `b`. However, we can describe it as `b` is either the difference between the elements at indices `l-1` and `l-r-1` in list `A`, minus the product of the difference between the indices of the '>' characters at indices `l-1` and `l-r-1` in list `idx_A` and the difference between `l` and `r`, plus the product of the difference between 2 and the index of the '>' character at index `l-1` in list `idx_A` and the value of `r`, or the element at index `l-1` in list `A` plus the product of the difference between 2 and the index of the '>' character at index `l-1` in list `idx_A` and the value of `r`.
* `n` is at least 3, but its exact value is not provided.
* `i` is 2.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')`

The expression inside the print statement is a sum of three terms:

1. `a * 2`: This is twice the value of `a`, which we described earlier.
2. `b * 2`: This is twice the value of `b`, which we described earlier.
3. `(n - i)`: This is the difference between `n` and `i`, which is at least 1 (since `n` is at least 3 and `i` is 2).

The `end=' '` argument means that the output will be followed by a space.

Putting it all together, the output will be:

Output: **twice the value of a, plus twice the value of b, plus the difference between n and i, where a is the value of the element at index r-1 in list B, plus the product of the difference between the index of the '>' character at index r-1 in list idx_B and 2, and the value of r, and b is either the difference between the elements at indices l-1 and l-r-1 in list A, minus the product of the difference between the indices of the '>' characters at indices l-1 and l-r-1 in list idx_A and the difference between l and r, plus the product of the difference between 2 and the index of the '>' character at index l-1 in list idx_A and the value of r, or the element at index l-1 in list A plus the product of the difference between 2 and the index of the '>' character at index l-1 in list idx_A and the value of r, and n is at least 3, and i is 2**
