Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '<'. If the length of `idx_B` is 0, `B` contains a single element 0. Otherwise, the last element of `B` is x and the length of `idx_B` is larger than 0.***
