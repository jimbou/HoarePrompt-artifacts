Based on the precondition, let's break down the variables and their values:

* `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. Since `i` is 1, `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the '>' character in `s` at position `l-1`, and `l` is not explicitly defined, we can't determine the exact value of `a`. However, we can describe it as `A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
* `b` is calculated as `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Since `i` is 1, `idx_B[r - l]` is the index of the '<' character in `s` at position `r-l`, and `r` is equal to `n`, we can describe `b` as `B[n] - B[n - l] - (idx_B[n - l] - 1) * (n - l) + (idx_B[n] - 1) * l`.
* `i` is 1.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')`

The expression inside the print statement is:

`a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`

Substituting the descriptions of `a` and `b`, we get:

`(A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) * 2 + (B[n] - B[n - l] - (idx_B[n - l] - 1) * (n - l) + (idx_B[n] - 1) * l) * 2 + 1 + 1`

This is a complex expression, but we can simplify it by combining like terms:

`2 * A[l - 1] + 2 * (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l + 2 * B[n] - 2 * B[n - l] - 2 * (idx_B[n - l] - 1) * (n - l) + 2 * (idx_B[n] - 1) * l + 2`

Since `l` is not explicitly defined, we can't determine the exact value of this expression. However, we can describe it as a linear combination of the elements of `A` and `B`, the indices of the '>' and '<' characters in `s`, and the value of `n`.

Output: **a linear combination of the elements of A and B, the indices of the '>' and '<' characters in s, and the value of n**
