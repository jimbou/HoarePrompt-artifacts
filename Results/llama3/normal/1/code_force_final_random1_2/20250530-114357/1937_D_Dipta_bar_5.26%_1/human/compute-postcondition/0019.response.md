Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `idx_A` is empty, `A` is a list containing one element 0. Otherwise, `A` is a list with an additional element `x`, where `x` is the sum of the last element of `A`, the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A`, and the length of `idx_A`.***
