Postcondition: ***s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 3, A is a list of integers, idx_A is a list of indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list of integers, idx_B is a list of indices of '<' characters in s and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in s, j is n, i is 2, a is A[2], x is r - 4, if x is greater or equal to 0, then b is B[r - 1] - B[r - 4] - (idx_B[r - 4] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - 3), otherwise, no changes are made.***
