Output: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 3, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 2, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is `B[r]`, if `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is the result of subtracting `A[l - r - 2]` and the product of (`idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]`) and (`l - r - 1`) from the original value of `b` plus (`i - idx_A[l - 1]`) * (`r + 1`), otherwise, `b` remains unchanged plus (`i - idx_A[l - 1]`) * (`r + 1`), and this is printed: a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)**
