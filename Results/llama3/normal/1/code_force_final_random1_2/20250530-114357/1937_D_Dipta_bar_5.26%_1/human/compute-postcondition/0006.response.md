Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is greater than 0, A is a list with an additional element x, idx_A is a list that is not empty, i is 0, and the current value of s[i] is '>'**.

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated by taking the last element of list `A`, adding the difference between the current index `i` and the last index in `idx_A` multiplied by the length of `idx_A`. This calculated value of `x` is then appended to list `A`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
