Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1. The character at index `i` of `s` is '<'. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the index `i` plus 1, which is 1, is being printed. If `l` is larger than 0, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if the difference between the current value of `r` and the current value of `l` is less than 0. Otherwise, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. The value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is being printed. If `l` is larger than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value of `n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]` is being printed, where `n` is at least 1 and `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the first '>' character in `s`. If `r` is not 0, then if `l - r - 1 > 0`, `a` is the last element of `B`, and `b` is the second last element of `A` minus the last element of `A` and minus the difference between the last index of '>' in `s` and the index of '>' in `s` at position `l - r - 2` times `l - r - 1`, plus the difference between the current index `i` and the index of '>' in `s` at position `l - 1` times `r + 1`. Otherwise, `b` is the second last element of `A` minus the last element of `A` and minus the difference between the last index of '>' in `s` and the index of '>' in `s` at position `l - r - 2` times `l - r - 1`. The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed, where `a` is the last element of `B`, `b` is the calculated value based on the conditions, and `n - i` is the difference between `n` and the current index `i`.***
