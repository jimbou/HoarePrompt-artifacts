Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is larger than 0, `j` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been updated to `n - 2` because `j` is 1 and `n` is the length of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
