According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`, `A` is an empty list, and `idx_A` is an empty list. For the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
