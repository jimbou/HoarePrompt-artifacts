Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be at least 1, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of indices of '<' characters in `s` and its length is equal to the number of '<' characters in `s`, `j` is `n`, `i` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B` minus 1. The character at index `i` of `s` is '<'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still consists of '<' and '>' characters, and `n` is still at least 1. The lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged. The variables `j`, `i`, and `l` are still `n`, 0, and 0, respectively. However, the variable `r` has been decremented by 1, so it is now the length of `B` minus 1. The character at index `i` of `s` is still '<'.
