This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and m. It calculates a value 'ans' based on the given formula and prints the integer value of 'ans' for each test case. The function iterates over the range from 2 to m (inclusive), updating 'ans' by adding the integer division of 'g' by the current count, where 'g' is calculated as 'n' divided by the current count minus the count minus one. The function breaks the loop if 'g' becomes less than the count minus one. The final state of the program is that the integer value of 'ans' is printed for each test case.
