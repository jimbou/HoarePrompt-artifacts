Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 4, count is 3, ans is n + int(n / count) + 1, countmins is 2, g is an integer equal to int(n / count). If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
