According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable count and m. If count is less than or equal to m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, count is 4, m is greater than or equal to 4. count being 4 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to count is less than or equal to m. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 4, count is less than or equal to m, ans is n + int(n / count) + int(g / count) + 2, countmins is 2, g is an integer equal to int(n / count) - countmins**
