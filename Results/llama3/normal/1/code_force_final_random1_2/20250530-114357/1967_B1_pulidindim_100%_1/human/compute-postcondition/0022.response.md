State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is equal to `n + int(g / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1 + int((g - countmins) / count) + 1 + ... (m - 2) times`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is an integer equal to `int(n / count) - countmins`**
