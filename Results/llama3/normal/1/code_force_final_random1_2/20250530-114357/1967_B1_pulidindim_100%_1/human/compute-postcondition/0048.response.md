Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, and `g` is less than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial values, but the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it was directly inside.
