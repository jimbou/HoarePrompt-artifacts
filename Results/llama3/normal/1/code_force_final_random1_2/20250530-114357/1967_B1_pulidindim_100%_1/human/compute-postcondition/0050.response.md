Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, count is 3, ans is n + int(g / 2) + 1, countmins is 1, g is an integer less than its original value by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t`, `i`, `m`, and `countmins` remains unchanged. The value of `count` is incremented by 1, becoming 3. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its original value `n`. The value of `g` is decremented by 1, becoming less than its original value by 1.
