Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 4, count is 5, ans is n + int(g / 2) + 1 + int((g - countmins) / count) + 1 + int((g - countmins) / count) + 1, countmins is 3, g is int(n / count).**

In this output state, the value of `g` has been reduced by `countmins` (3), and `ans` has been incremented by the integer division of the new `g` by `count` (4) plus 1. The value of `count` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
