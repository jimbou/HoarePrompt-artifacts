Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 2, count is 2, ans is n, countmins is 1, g is an integer equal to int(n / count). If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
