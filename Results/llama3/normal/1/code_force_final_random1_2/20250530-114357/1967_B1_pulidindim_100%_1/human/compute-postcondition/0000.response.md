Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two integers n, m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is the number of test cases. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each test case containing two integers n, m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).
