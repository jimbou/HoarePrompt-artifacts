Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 4, `count` is less than or equal to `m`, `ans` is `n + int(n / count) + int(g / count) + 2`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is an integer equal to `int(n / count) - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
