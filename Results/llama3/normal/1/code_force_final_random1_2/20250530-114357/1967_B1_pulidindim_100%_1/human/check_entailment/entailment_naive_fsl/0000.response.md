Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the fact that the program only considers values of `count` up to `m`, but it should consider all divisors of `n` up to `m`.

For example, when `n = 10` and `m = 8`, the program will only consider `count` values up to 8, but it should also consider the divisor 10, which is not accounted for.

A correct solution would involve iterating over all divisors of `n` up to `m` and calculating the corresponding valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for d in range(1, n + 1):
            if n % d == 0:
                count = 1
                while count * d <= m:
                    ans += 1
                    count += 1
        print(ans)
```
This corrected program iterates over all divisors `d` of `n` and calculates the number of valid pairs for each divisor. The inner loop increments `count` until `count * d` exceeds `m`, ensuring that all valid pairs are accounted for.
