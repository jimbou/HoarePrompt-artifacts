The code prints the integer value of `ans`, which is a calculated value based on the given variables `n`, `m`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. `count` is equal to `m + 1`.
2. `countmins` is equal to `m - 1`.
3. `g` is equal to `int(n / count) - countmins`.
4. `ans` is equal to `n + int(g / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1 + int((g - countmins) / count) + 1 + ... (m - 2) times`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `g` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated integer value of `ans`.

Output: **integer value of ans (where ans is the calculated value based on n, m, count, countmins, and g)**
