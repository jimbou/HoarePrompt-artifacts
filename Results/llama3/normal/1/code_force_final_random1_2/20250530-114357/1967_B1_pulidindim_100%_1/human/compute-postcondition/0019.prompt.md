Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, count is 2, ans is equal to n
Code of the loop:
while count <= m:
    countmins = int(count - 1)
    g = int(n / count)
    if g < countmins:
        break
    g -= countmins
    ans += int(g / count) + 1
    count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 2, count is 3, ans is equal to n + int(g / count) + 1, countmins is 1, g is an integer equal to its original value minus 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 2, count is less than or equal to m and is one more than its original value, ans is equal to n + int(g / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1, countmins is 0, g is an integer equal to int(n / count) - countmins.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 2, count is less than m and is two more than its original value, ans is equal to n + int(g / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1 + int((g - countmins) / count) + 1, countmins is one less than count, g is an integer equal to int(n / count) - countmins. If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
