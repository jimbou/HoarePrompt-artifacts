To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is an integer greater than 1. To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 2.

The other variables `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n + int(n / count) + int(g / count) + 2 + int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is an integer equal to `int(n / count) - countmins`**
