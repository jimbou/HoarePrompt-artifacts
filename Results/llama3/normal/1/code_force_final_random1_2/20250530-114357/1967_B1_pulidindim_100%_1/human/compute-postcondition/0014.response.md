The variable in the loop head is variable count and m, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable count and m.  If count is less than or equal to m, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, count is less than or equal to m and is one more than its original value, So for the loop to be executed one more time count must be less than m.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 2, count is less than m and is one more than its original value, ans is equal to n + int(g / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1, countmins is 0, g is an integer equal to int(n / count) - countmins.**
