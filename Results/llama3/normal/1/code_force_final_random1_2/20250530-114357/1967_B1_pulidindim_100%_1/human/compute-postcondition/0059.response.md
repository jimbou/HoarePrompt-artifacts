Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 4, count is 4, ans is n + int(g / 2) + 1 + int((g - countmins) / count) + 1, countmins is 3, g is int(n / count). If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of the variables.***
