Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, m is greater than or equal to 2, count is less than or equal to m, ans is equal to n + int(g / count) + 1, countmins is 0, g is an integer equal to int(n / count). If g is less than countmins, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of the variables.***
