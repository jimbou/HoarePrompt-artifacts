Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `count` is less than or equal to `m`, `ans` is equal to `n + int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is an integer equal to `int(n / count)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
