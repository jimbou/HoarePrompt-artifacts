The `print(int(ans))` statement will print the integer value of `ans`. 

`ans` is a variable that is calculated based on several other variables: `n`, `count`, and `g`. 

`count` is equal to `m + 1`, where `m` is an integer. 

`g` is equal to `int(n / count) - countmins`, where `countmins` is equal to `m - 1`. 

So, `ans` is equal to `n + int(n / count) + int(g / count) + 2 + int(g / count) + 1`. 

Since `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g` are all integers, `ans` will also be an integer. 

However, the exact value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `n`, `m`, and `count`. 

Therefore, the print statement will output the integer value of `ans`, which is a function of `n`, `m`, and `count`.

Output: **the integer value of ans (where ans is n + int(n / (m + 1)) + int((int(n / (m + 1)) - (m - 1)) / (m + 1)) + 2 + int((int(n / (m + 1)) - (m - 1)) / (m + 1)) + 1)**
