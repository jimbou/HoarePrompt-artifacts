The code prints the integer value of `ans`, which is a calculated value based on the given variables `n`, `m`, and `count`.

`ans` is calculated as `n + sum(int(g / count) + 1 for count in range(2, m + 1))`. Here, `g` is calculated as `int(n / m) - (m - 1)`, which is an integer value.

Since `count` ranges from 2 to `m + 1`, the `sum` function calculates the sum of `int(g / count) + 1` for each value of `count` in this range.

The `int(ans)` function converts the calculated value of `ans` to an integer, which is then printed.

Output: **n + sum(int((int(n / m) - (m - 1)) / count) + 1 for count in range(2, m + 1)) (where n, m are the given integer values)**
