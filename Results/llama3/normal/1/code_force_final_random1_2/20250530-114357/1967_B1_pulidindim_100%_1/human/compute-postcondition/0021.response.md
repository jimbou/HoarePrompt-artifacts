Output: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, count is m + 1, ans is equal to n + int(g / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1 + int((g - countmins) / count) + 1 + ... (m - 2) times, countmins is m - 1, g is an integer equal to int(n / count) - countmins, and the integer value of ans is being printed**
