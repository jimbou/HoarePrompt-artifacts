Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly sorts the monsters by their distance from the character using the `sorted_indices` list. This is because the `sorted` function in Python is stable, meaning that when multiple records have the same key, their original order is preserved.

2. The program then iterates over the sorted monsters, and for each monster, it tries to kill it using the available bullets (`k`). If a monster can be killed, it is removed from the list of alive monsters (`pos` is incremented).

3. The program also correctly updates the distance of the monsters from the character (`distance` is incremented) after each iteration.

4. The program checks if any monster reaches the character (`abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`) and returns `False` if so.

5. If all monsters are killed before any of them reach the character, the program returns `True`.

6. The main function (`func_2`) correctly reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the result.

Therefore, the program correctly determines if the character can survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the character.

Correctness: **True**
