Based on the precondition, we can determine what will be printed when the print statement is executed.

The `func_1(a, x, k)` function is not defined in the precondition, so we cannot determine its exact behavior. However, we can make an educated guess based on the context.

The `a` list contains n non-negative integers, and the `x` list contains n non-zero integers. The `k` variable is a positive integer.

Given this information, it's likely that `func_1(a, x, k)` is a function that checks some condition involving the elements of `a` and `x`, possibly related to the value of `k`.

If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, the print statement will output `'YES'`. If it returns `False`, the print statement will output `'NO'`.

Since we don't know the exact behavior of `func_1(a, x, k)`, we can't determine the exact output. However, we can describe the output in terms of the function's return value.

Output: **'YES' if func_1(a, x, k) returns True, 'NO' if func_1(a, x, k) returns False**
