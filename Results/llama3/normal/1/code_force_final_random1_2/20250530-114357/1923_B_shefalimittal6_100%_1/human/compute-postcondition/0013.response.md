Output State: **a is a list of n non-negative integers, x is a list of n non-zero integers, k is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, stdin is empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the return value of func_1(a, x, k), and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the return value of func_1(a, x, k), t is greater than or equal to 0.**

This output state indicates that after the loop executes all its iterations, the variables `a`, `x`, `k`, and `n` retain their initial properties, the standard input is empty, and the output depends on the return value of the function `func_1(a, x, k)`. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is greater than or equal to 0.
