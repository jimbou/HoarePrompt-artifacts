Reasoning: The given function, func_1, is defined as follows:

def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy

This function takes two inputs: a list of two integers (x, y) and another list of two integers (dx, dy). It then returns a new list of two integers, where the first integer is the sum of x and dx, and the second integer is the sum of y and dy.

In the context of the Quidditch game, this function is used to update the position of an entity (player or ball) on the field. The input a represents the current position of the entity, and the input b represents the movement direction (dx, dy).

The function correctly calculates the new position of the entity by adding the movement direction to the current position. This is a simple and correct implementation of the movement logic in the game.

Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
