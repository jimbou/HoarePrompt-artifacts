#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of two integers N and M, where 3 <= N, M <= 99 and N and M are odd, b is a list of N lists of M pairs of characters separated by spaces, each pair of characters represents a position on the field.
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns two values: the first value is the sum of an odd integer between 3 and 99 and a list of N lists of M pairs of characters separated by spaces, and the second value is the sum of another odd integer between 3 and 99 and a list of N lists of M pairs of characters separated by spaces.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two inputs: a list of two odd integers between 3 and 99, and a list of N lists of M pairs of characters separated by spaces. It then returns two values: the sum of the first odd integer and the list of pairs of characters, and the sum of the second odd integer and the list of pairs of characters. The function effectively combines the integer values with the list of pairs of characters, but does not perform any operations on the pairs of characters themselves.
