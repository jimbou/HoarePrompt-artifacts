Functionality: **This function takes two inputs: a list of two odd integers between 3 and 99, and a list of N lists of M pairs of characters separated by spaces. It then returns two values: the sum of the first odd integer and the list of pairs of characters, and the sum of the second odd integer and the list of pairs of characters. The function effectively combines the integer values with the list of pairs of characters, but does not perform any operations on the pairs of characters themselves.**
