The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is not guaranteed to be at least 1, so it needs to be adjusted to be at least 1.

State: **stdin contains an integer t that must be at least 1**
