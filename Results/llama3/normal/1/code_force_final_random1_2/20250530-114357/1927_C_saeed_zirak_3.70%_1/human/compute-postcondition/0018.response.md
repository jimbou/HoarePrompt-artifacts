Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, stdin is empty. Either i is not in a or i is not in b. If i is in a and aOnes is less than or equal to newk, then aOnes is 1. If i is in b and bOnes is less than or equal to newk, then bOnes is greater than 0 and less than or equal to newk. If i is in a and aOnes is greater than newk or if i is in b and bOnes is greater than newk, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
