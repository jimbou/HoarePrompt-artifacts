The value of `bOnes` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `t` is 1, Stdin is empty, `k` is greater than or equal to 3. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `t` is 1, `bOnes` is increased by 1, Stdin is empty, `k` is greater than or equal to 3.**
