Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 2. `a`, `b` are lists of integers. `i` is less than `k` and is increased by 1. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if the number of ones in `a` is less than the number of ones in `b`, `aOnes` is 1 or 2 and `bOnes` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is larger or equal to `bOnes` which is 1 or 2. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if 1 is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1 or 2. If 1 is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `newk` and increased by 1 if `i` is in `b`. If 1 is in `a` and `aOnes` is greater than `newk` or if 1 is in `b` and `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of the variables do not change, but the program flow is affected by the break statement.
