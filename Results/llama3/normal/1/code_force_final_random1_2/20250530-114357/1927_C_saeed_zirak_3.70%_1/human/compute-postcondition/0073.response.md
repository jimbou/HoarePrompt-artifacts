Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `t` is 1, `aOnes` is increased by 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, Stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `aOnes` has been incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The precondition that `k` is greater than or equal to 3 is still valid.
