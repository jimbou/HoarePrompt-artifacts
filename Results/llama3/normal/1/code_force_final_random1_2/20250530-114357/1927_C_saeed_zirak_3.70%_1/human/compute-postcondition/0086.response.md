Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `t` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, Stdin is empty. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.***
