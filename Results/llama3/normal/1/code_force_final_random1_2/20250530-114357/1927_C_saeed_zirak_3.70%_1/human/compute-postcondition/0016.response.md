Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, Either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. Additionally, either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`. Either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is larger than `newk`**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change. The conditions on the variables are still valid after the code has been executed.
