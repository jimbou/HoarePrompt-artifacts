Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, aOnes is 0, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2 rounded down, stdin is empty. Either i is not in a or i is not in b. Additionally, either i is not in a or aOnes is greater than newk. If i is in b and bOnes is less than or equal to newk, then bOnes is greater than 0 and less than or equal to newk and the current value of i is in b. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and either i is not in b or bOnes is larger than newk.***
