Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 1. `a`, `b` are lists of integers. `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If the value 1 is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if the number of ones in list `a` is less than the number of ones in list `b`, `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to `bOnes` + 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is larger or equal to `bOnes` which is greater than 1. If the value 1 is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if 1 is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1. If 1 is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `newk` + 1. If 1 is in `a` and `aOnes` is greater than `newk` or if 1 is in `b` and `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `bOnes` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `aOnes` and `bOnes` have been updated to reflect the new value of `bOnes`.
