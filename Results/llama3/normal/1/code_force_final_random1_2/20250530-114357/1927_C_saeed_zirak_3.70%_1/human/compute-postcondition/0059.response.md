Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, Stdin is empty. The current value of `i` is present in both list `a` and list `b`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes`. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`***
