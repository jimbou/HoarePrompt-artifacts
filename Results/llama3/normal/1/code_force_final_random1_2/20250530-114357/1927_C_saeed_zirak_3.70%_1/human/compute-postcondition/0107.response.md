Output State: **n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, aOnes is 1, bOnes is greater than 1, newk is k divided by 2, the current value of i is 1, Stdin is empty, and i is present in both list a and list b.**

In this output state, the value of aOnes has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition that aOnes is less than bOnes is still valid, but now aOnes is 1 and bOnes is greater than 1.
