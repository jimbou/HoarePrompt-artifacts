Postcondition: ***n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is k divided by 2, the current value of i is 1, Stdin is empty. If i is present in both list a and list b, then aOnes is 1 and bOnes is greater than 1 if aOnes is less than bOnes, otherwise aOnes is 0 and bOnes is 1. If i is not in a or not in b, then either i is not in b or bOnes is more than newk if i is in a and aOnes is more than newk, otherwise aOnes is 1 if i is in a and aOnes is less than or equal to newk. If i is in b and bOnes is less than or equal to newk, then bOnes is more than 0 and less than or equal to newk + 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
