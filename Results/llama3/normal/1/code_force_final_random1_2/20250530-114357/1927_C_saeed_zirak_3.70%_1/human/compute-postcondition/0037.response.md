Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 2. `a`, `b` are lists of integers. `i` is less than `k` and is increased by 1. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if the number of ones in `a` is less than the number of ones in `b`, `aOnes` is 1 or 2 and `bOnes` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is larger or equal to `bOnes` which is 1 or 2. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if 1 is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1 or 2. If 1 is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `newk` and increased by 1 if `i` is in `b`. If 1 is in `a` and `aOnes` is greater than `newk` or if 1 is in `b` and `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `bOnes` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `i` remain the same. The value of `bOnes` is increased by 1. The conditions for `aOnes` and `bOnes` when `i` is in both `a` and `b`, or when `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, still hold. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is now greater than 0 and less than or equal to `newk` and increased by 1.
