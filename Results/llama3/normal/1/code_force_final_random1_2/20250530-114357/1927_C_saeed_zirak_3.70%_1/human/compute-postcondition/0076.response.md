Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `t` is 1, `aOnes` is increased by 1, Stdin is empty, `k` is greater than or equal to 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `t` remain the same as in the initial state. The variable `aOnes` is incremented by 1. The stdin remains empty. The condition that `k` is greater than or equal to 3 is still valid.
