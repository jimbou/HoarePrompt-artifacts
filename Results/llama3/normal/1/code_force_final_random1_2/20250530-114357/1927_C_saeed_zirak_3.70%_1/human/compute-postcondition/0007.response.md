Output State: **n, m, k are integers. k is larger or equal to 1. a, b are lists of integers. aOnes is larger or equal to bOnes which is 1. newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2 rounded down. The current value of i is 1. stdin is empty. The value 1 is present in both list a and list b.**

In this output state, the value of bOnes has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of aOnes is still larger or equal to bOnes, which is now 1.
