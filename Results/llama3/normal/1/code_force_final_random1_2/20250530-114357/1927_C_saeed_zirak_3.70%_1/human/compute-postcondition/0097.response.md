Output: **n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is k divided by 2, i is k + 1, t is 1, k is greater than or equal to 1, Stdin is empty. The current value of aOnes is equal to newk and the current value of bOnes is equal to newk. If i is in both a and b, then if aOnes was less than bOnes, aOnes has been increased by 1, otherwise bOnes has been increased by 1. If i is only in a and aOnes was less than or equal to newk, then aOnes has been increased by 1. If i is only in b and bOnes was less than or equal to newk, then bOnes has been increased by 1, and 'yes' is printed**
