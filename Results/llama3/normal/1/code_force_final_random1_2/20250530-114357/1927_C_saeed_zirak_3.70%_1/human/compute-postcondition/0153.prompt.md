Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_j <= 10^6).
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
        elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n, m, k are integers. a, b are lists of integers. i is equal to k + 1. aOnes is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to newk. bOnes is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to newk. If aOnes is equal to newk and bOnes is equal to newk, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is k divided by 2, i is k + 1, t is 1, k is greater than or equal to 1, Stdin is empty. If aOnes is equal to newk and bOnes is equal to newk, then if i is in both a and b, if aOnes was less than bOnes, aOnes has been increased by 1, otherwise bOnes has been increased by 1. If i is only in a and aOnes was less than or equal to newk, then aOnes has been increased by 1. If i is only in b and bOnes was less than or equal to newk, then bOnes has been increased by 1, and 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if aOnes is not equal to newk or bOnes is not equal to newk, then if i is in both a and b, if aOnes is less than bOnes, aOnes is increased by 1, otherwise bOnes is increased by 1. If i is only in a and aOnes is less than or equal to newk, then aOnes is increased by 1. If i is only in b and bOnes is less than or equal to newk, then bOnes is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is k divided by 2, i is k + 1, Stdin is empty. If aOnes is equal to newk and bOnes is equal to newk, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if i is in both a and b, then aOnes is not equal to bOnes or aOnes is not equal to newk or bOnes is not equal to newk, and 'no' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
