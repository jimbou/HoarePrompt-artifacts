Postcondition: ***n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, aOnes is 0, newk is k divided by 2, i is 1, Stdin is empty. Either i is not in a or i is not in b. Either i is not in a or aOnes is more than newk. If i is in b and bOnes is less than or equal to newk, then bOnes is more than 0 and less than or equal to newk + 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and either i is not in b or bOnes is more than newk.***
