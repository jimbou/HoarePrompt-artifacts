Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `t` is 1, Stdin is empty, `k` is greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
