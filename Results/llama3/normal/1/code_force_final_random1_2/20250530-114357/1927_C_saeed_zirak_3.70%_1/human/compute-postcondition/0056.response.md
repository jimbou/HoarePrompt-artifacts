Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes`, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, Stdin is empty. The current value of `i` is present in both list `a` and list `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `aOnes` has been incremented by 1, but it is still less than or equal to `bOnes`. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `i` is still present in both list `a` and list `b`.
