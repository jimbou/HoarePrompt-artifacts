Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 1. `a`, `b` are lists of integers. `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If the value 1 is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if the number of ones in list `a` is less than the number of ones in list `b`, `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is larger or equal to `bOnes` which is 1. If the value 1 is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if 1 is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1. If 1 is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `newk` and increased by 1 if `i` is in `b`. If 1 is in `a` and `aOnes` is greater than `newk` or if 1 is in `b` and `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
