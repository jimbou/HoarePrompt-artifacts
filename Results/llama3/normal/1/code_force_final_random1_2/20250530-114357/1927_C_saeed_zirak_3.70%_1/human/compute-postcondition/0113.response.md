Output State: **n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, aOnes is 1, bOnes is 0, newk is k divided by 2, i is 1, Stdin is empty. Either i is not in a or i is not in b. The current value of i is in a and the current value of aOnes is less than or equal to newk**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of aOnes has been incremented by 1, and it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of i is still 1 and it is in list a. The value of aOnes is still less than or equal to newk.
