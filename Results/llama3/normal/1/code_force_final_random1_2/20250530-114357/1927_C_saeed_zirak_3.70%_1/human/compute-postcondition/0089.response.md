Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `t` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it was directly inside.
