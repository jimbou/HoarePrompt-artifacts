Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, Stdin is empty. Either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. The current value of `i` is in `a` and the current value of `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `t`, and Stdin remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `aOnes` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The condition that either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b` still holds, and the current value of `i` is in `a`. Also, the current value of `aOnes` is still less than or equal to `newk`.
