Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. Either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is more than `newk`. Either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is more than `newk`.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The conditions that were true before the break statement are still true.
