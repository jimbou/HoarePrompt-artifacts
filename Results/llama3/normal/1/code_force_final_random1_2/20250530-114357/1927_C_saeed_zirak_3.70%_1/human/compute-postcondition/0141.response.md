Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `k` must be greater than 2, Stdin is empty. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
