Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, Stdin is empty. Either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. Either `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is more than `newk`***
