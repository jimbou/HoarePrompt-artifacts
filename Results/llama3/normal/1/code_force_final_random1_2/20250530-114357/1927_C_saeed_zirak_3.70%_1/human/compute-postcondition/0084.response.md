Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `t` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `aOnes` is increased by 1, Stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial properties, and the only change is that `aOnes` has been incremented by 1.
