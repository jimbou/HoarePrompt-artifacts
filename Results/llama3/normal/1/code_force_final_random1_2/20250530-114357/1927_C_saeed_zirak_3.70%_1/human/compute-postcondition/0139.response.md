Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 2, `bOnes` is increased by 1, Stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i` retain their initial values and properties. The only change is that the variable `bOnes` is incremented by 1. The stdin remains empty.
