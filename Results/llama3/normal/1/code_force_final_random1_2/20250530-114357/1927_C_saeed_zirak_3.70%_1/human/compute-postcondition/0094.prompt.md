Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, k are integers assigned from stdin. a is a list of integers. b is a list of integers. aOnes is 0. bOnes is 0. newk is k divided by 2. i is 1. t is 1. Stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `t` is 1, Stdin is empty. If `i` is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes`. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. If `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is more than 0 and less than or equal to `newk` + 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is more than `newk`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 3, `t` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, Stdin is empty. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is increased by 1, otherwise `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `a` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`, then if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k` and is increased by 1, `t` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, Stdin is empty. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is only in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is only in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
