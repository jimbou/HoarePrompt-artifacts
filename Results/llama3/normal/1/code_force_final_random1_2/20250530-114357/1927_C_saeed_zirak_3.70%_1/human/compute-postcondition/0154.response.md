Functionality: **This function determines whether it is possible to select k/2 elements from two lists, a and b, such that the selected elements are common to both lists or are present in one of the lists but not the other, and the total count of selected elements in each list is k/2. The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'yes' if the condition is met, otherwise prints 'no'.**
