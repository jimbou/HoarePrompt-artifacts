Postcondition: ***n, m, k are integers. k is larger or equal to 1. a, b are lists of integers. The value 1 is present in both list a and list b. newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2 rounded down. The current value of i is 1. stdin is empty. If the number of ones in list a is less than the number of ones in list b, then aOnes is 1 and bOnes is greater than 1. Otherwise, aOnes is larger or equal to bOnes which is 1.***
