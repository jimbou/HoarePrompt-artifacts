Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `t` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, and `t` do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The stdin remains empty. The condition that `k` is greater than or equal to 3 is still valid.
