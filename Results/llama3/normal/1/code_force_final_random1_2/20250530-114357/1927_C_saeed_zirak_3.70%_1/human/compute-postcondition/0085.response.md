Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `t` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `bOnes` is increased by 1, Stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `bOnes` has been increased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `t` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, and Stdin is empty still holds true.
