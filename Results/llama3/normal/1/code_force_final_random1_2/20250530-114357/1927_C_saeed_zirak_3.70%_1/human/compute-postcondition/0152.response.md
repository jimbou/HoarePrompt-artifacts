Postcondition: ***n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is k divided by 2, i is k + 1, Stdin is empty. If aOnes is equal to newk and bOnes is equal to newk, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if i is in both a and b, then aOnes is not equal to bOnes or aOnes is not equal to newk or bOnes is not equal to newk, and 'no' is printed.***
