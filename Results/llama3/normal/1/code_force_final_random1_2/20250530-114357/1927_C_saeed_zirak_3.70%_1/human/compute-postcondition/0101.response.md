Postcondition: ***n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, newk is k divided by 2, i is k + 1, t is 1, k is greater than or equal to 1, Stdin is empty. If aOnes is equal to newk and bOnes is equal to newk, then if i is in both a and b, if aOnes was less than bOnes, aOnes has been increased by 1, otherwise bOnes has been increased by 1. If i is only in a and aOnes was less than or equal to newk, then aOnes has been increased by 1. If i is only in b and bOnes was less than or equal to newk, then bOnes has been increased by 1, and 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if aOnes is not equal to newk or bOnes is not equal to newk, then if i is in both a and b, if aOnes is less than bOnes, aOnes is increased by 1, otherwise bOnes is increased by 1. If i is only in a and aOnes is less than or equal to newk, then aOnes is increased by 1. If i is only in b and bOnes is less than or equal to newk, then bOnes is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'no' is printed.***
