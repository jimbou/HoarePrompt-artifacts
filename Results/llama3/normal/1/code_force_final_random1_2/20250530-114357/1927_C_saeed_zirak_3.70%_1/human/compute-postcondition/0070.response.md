Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, Stdin is empty. If `i` is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is less than or equal to `bOnes`. Otherwise, `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`. If `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`, then if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is more than 0 and less than or equal to `newk` + 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and either `i` is not in `b` or `bOnes` is more than `newk`.**
