Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, aOnes is 0, bOnes is 0, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2 rounded down, i is 1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 1. `a`, `b` are lists of integers. `i` is increased by 1. If the value 1 is present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if the number of ones in list `a` is less than the number of ones in list `b`, `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is larger or equal to `bOnes` which is 1. If the value 1 is not present in both list `a` and list `b`, then if 1 is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1. If 1 is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `newk`. If 1 is in `a` and `aOnes` is greater than `newk` or if 1 is in `b` and `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 1. `a`, `b` are lists of integers. `i` is less than or equal to `k` and is increased by 1. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if the number of ones in `a` is less than the number of ones in `b`, `aOnes` is 1 or 2 and `bOnes` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is larger or equal to `bOnes` which is 1 or 2. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if 1 is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1 or 2. If 1 is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `newk` and increased by 1 if `i` is in `b`. If 1 is in `a` and `aOnes` is greater than `newk` or if 1 is in `b` and `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 2. `a`, `b` are lists of integers. `i` is less than `k` and is increased by 1. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then if the number of ones in `a` is less than the number of ones in `b`, `aOnes` is 1 or 2 and `bOnes` is greater than 1 and increased by 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is larger or equal to `bOnes` which is 1 or 2 and increased by 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if 1 is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `aOnes` is 1 or 2 or 3. If 1 is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `newk` and increased by 1 if `i` is in `b`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If 1 is in `a` and `aOnes` is greater than `newk` or if 1 is in `b` and `bOnes` is greater than `newk`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
