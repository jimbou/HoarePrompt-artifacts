Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2 rounded down, `i` is 1, stdin is empty. The current value of `i` is in `a` and the current value of `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`. Either `i` is not in `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `aOnes` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The condition that the current value of `i` is in `a` and the current value of `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk` still holds. Additionally, the condition that either `i` is not in `b` is still valid.
