Based on the precondition, the value of `ans` is determined by comparing the first character of the first string in the list `gr` with the last character of the last string in the list `gr`. If they are the same, `ans` is 'YES', otherwise it is 'NO'.

Since the exact strings in the list `gr` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `ans`. However, we can describe it based on the condition.

Output: **'YES' if the first character of the first string in `gr` is the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, 'NO' otherwise**
