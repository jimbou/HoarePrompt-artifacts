Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', and 'YES' is printed if the first character of the first string in `gr` is the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, 'NO' otherwise**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 'YES', and all other variables remain unchanged. The condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' is still dependent on the first character of the first string in `gr` being the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`.
