Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `ans` is 'NO', and if for all `j`, the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is now 'NO', and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `gr`, `impossible`, and other variables are still valid, but the value of `ans` has been explicitly set to 'NO'.
