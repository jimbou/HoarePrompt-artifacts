This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m) followed by n lines of m characters ('W' and 'B'). It then checks if the first character of the first line is the same as the last character of the last line. If they are the same, it prints 'YES', otherwise, it checks if there are any differences in the first or last columns or rows. If there are no differences, it prints 'NO', otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function repeats this process for all test cases.
