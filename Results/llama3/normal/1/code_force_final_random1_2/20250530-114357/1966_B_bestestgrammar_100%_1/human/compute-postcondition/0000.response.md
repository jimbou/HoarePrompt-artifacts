Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`: This line reads an integer from the standard input (stdin) and assigns it to the variable `t`.

Since the initial state mentions that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts with two integers `n` and `m`, we can assume that the first integer `t` represents the number of test cases.

After reading the first integer `t`, the stdin will still contain the remaining input, which includes the two integers `n` and `m` for each test case, followed by `n` lines of `m` characters each.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 500) followed by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters 'W' and 'B'.**

Note that the values of `n` and `m` are not yet known, as they will be read in subsequent inputs. The output state only reflects the change in the value of `t` and the remaining input in stdin.
