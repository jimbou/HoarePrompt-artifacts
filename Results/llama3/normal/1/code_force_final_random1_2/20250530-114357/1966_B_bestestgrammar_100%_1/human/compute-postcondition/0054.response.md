Output State: **t is at least 2, tc is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n, ans is either 'YES' or 'NO', impossible is either True or False, stdin contains no input**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `gr` will contain `n` strings, where `n` is the number of iterations of the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and the other variables will remain unchanged.
