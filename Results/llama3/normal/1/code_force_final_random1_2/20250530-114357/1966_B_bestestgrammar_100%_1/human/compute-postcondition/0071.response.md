Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n`, stdin contains no input, and `j` is `m - 1`. If `impossible` is True, then `ans` is 'NO' and `impossible` is True. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES' and `impossible` is False.***
