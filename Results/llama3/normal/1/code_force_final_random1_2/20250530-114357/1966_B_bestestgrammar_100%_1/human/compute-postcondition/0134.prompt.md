Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 500) followed by `n` lines, each containing `m` characters 'W' and 'B'.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    gr = []
    for i in range(n):
        gr.append(input())
    ans = 'YES'
    if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
        impossible = True
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
        impossible = True
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, then if for all `j`, the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO' and `impossible` is True. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES' and `impossible` is False. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, then `ans` is 'YES'. The value of `ans` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, and this is printed: 'YES' if the first character of the first string in `gr` is the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, 'NO' otherwise

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES' if the first character of the first string in `gr` is the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, 'NO' otherwise. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, then `ans` is 'NO', and 'YES' or 'NO' is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
