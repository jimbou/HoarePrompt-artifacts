Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing one string, `i` is 0, and 'YES' is printed if the first character of the string in gr is the same as the last character of the string in gr, 'NO' otherwise**

In this output state, the value of `gr` has changed to a list containing one string, which is the input string accepted by the `input()` function. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' is still dependent on the first and last characters of the string in `gr`.
