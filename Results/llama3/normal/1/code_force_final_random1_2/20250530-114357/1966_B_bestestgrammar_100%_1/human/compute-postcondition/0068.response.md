Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, stdin contains no input, and `j` is `m - 1`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, stdin contains no input, and `j` is `m - 1`. This means that the loop has iterated `m - 1` times, and the value of `impossible` has been set to False if any of the conditions in the loop body were met. The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, and stdin remain unchanged.
