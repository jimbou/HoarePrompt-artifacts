Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the list `gr` containing `n` strings, where `n` is the number of iterations the loop executed. The variable `i` will be one less than `n`, since it starts at 0 and increments up to `n-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
