Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-1`. If there exists at least one `j` such that the current value of `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` is True.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `gr`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
* The loop variable `j` has reached its final value, which is `m-1`.
* The value of `impossible` depends on whether there exists at least one `j` such that the current value of `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`. If such a `j` exists, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` is True.
