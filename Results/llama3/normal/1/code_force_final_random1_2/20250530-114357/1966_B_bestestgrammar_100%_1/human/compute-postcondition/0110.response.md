Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, and `j` is 2**

The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `impossible`, which was already `False` in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values.
