The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 3, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is 3, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'NO'. If `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.**
