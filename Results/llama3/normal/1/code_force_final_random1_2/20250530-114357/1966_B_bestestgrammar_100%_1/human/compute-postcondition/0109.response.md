The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, and `j` is 2**
