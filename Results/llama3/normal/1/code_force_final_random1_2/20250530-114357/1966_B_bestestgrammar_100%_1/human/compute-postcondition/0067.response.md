Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, stdin contains no input, and `j` is 2. If the first or last string in `gr` has different characters at indices `j` and `j + 1`, then the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
