Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.

The program first checks if the top-left and bottom-right squares are the same color. If they are not, it checks if there are any adjacent squares in the first row or the last row that are different colors. If there are no such adjacent squares, it means that the first row and the last row are monochromatic, and it is impossible to make all squares the same color. The program then checks if there are any adjacent squares in the first column or the last column that are different colors. If there are no such adjacent squares, it means that the first column and the last column are monochromatic, and it is impossible to make all squares the same color.

If the program passes these checks, it means that it is possible to make all squares the same color, and it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Correctness: **True**
