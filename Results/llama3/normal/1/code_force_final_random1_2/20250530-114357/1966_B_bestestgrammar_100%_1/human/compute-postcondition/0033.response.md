Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If for all `j`, the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES'. `impossible` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The condition regarding the first character of the first string in `gr` and the last character of the last string in `gr` still holds. The value of `ans` is still determined by the condition on `gr[0][j]` and `gr[n - 1][j]`. However, the value of `impossible` is now False, regardless of the previous conditions.
