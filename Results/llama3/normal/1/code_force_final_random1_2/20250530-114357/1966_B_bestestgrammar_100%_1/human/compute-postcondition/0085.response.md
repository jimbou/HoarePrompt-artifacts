The code `ans = 'NO'` assigns the value 'NO' to the variable `ans`. The previous value of `ans` was already 'NO', so this assignment does not change the value of `ans`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'NO', and there does not exist at least one pair of adjacent strings in `gr` where the first or last characters are different, so `impossible` is True.**
