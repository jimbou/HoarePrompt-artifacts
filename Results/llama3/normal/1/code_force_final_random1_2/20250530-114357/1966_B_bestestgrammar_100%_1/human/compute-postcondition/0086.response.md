Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'NO'. If there exists at least one pair of adjacent strings in `gr` where the first or last characters are different, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` is True.***
