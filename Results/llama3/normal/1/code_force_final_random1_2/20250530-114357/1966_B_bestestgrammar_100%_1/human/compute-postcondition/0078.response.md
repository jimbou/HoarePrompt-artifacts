Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is False.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `impossible`, which is now set to False. This means that the condition that previously determined the value of `impossible` based on the values of `gr[i][0]`, `gr[i + 1][0]`, `gr[i][m - 1]`, and `gr[i + 1][m - 1]` is no longer applicable, and `impossible` is now explicitly set to False.
