Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, stdin contains no input, and `j` is 2**

The code simply assigns the value False to the variable `impossible`. Since `impossible` was already False in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
