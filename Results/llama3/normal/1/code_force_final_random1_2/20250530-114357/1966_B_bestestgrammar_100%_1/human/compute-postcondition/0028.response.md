To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range is `n - 1`), and `i` should be 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is 0, `j` is `m-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If for all `j`, the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True.**
