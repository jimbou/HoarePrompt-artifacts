Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the following input:

3 3
BBB
BBB
BBB

The program will output "YES", but it should output "NO" because it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color, and if they are not, it checks if there are any adjacent squares of the same color in the top or bottom row, or in the left or right column. However, this is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

For example, in the case above, the top-left and bottom-right corners are both "B", but there are no adjacent squares of the same color in the top or bottom row, or in the left or right column. Therefore, the program incorrectly outputs "YES".

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to check all possible subrectangles of the grid, not just the top and bottom rows and left and right columns.
