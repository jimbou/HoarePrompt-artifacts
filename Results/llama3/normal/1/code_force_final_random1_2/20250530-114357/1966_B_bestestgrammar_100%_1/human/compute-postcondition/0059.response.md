Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True, stdin contains no input, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, and `j` is 0. Additionally, the current value of `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`.**
