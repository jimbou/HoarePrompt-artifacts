To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Since `i` is initialized to `n` before the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `n` for the loop to execute. We also need to adjust `n` to be at least 2.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'NO', and `impossible` is True**
