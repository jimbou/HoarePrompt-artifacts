Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'NO', and `impossible` is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent strings in `gr` where the first or last characters are different, otherwise `impossible` is True.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, and `impossible` will be False if there is at least one pair of adjacent strings in `gr` where the first or last characters are different. Otherwise, `impossible` will remain True. The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
