To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 2, because `range(m - 1)` needs to have at least one iteration. The initial value of `j` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the range.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True, stdin contains no input, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, and `j` is 0**
