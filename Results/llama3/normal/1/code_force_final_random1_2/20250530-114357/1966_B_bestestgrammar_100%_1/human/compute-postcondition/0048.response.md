To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, which means `n` must be at least 1 for `i` to be a valid index. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1.

The other variables `t`, `tc`, `m`, `gr`, `ans`, and `impossible` are not directly related to the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `impossible` is either True or False, stdin contains no input**
