Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True. The first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.**

In this output state, the value of `impossible` has been set to True, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The first character of the first string in `gr` is still not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, as this condition was not affected by the code.
