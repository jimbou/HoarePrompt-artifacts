Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True, and 'YES' is printed if the first character of the first string in `gr` is the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, 'NO' otherwise. The current value of the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the current value of the last character of the last string in `gr`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m - 1):
    if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
        impossible = False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, and 'YES' is printed if the first character of the first string in `gr` is the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, 'NO' otherwise. The current value of the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the current value of the last character of the last string in `gr`. The current value of j is 0. If either the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, no change in the state of the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, and `j` is 1. If the first and second characters of the first and last strings in `gr` are different, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, and `j` is 2. If the first and second characters of the first string in `gr` are different or the first and second characters of the last string in `gr` are different, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
