Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is 1, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'NO'. If `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.***
