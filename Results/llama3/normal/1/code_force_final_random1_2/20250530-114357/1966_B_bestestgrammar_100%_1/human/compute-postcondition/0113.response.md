Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True, and 'YES' is printed if the first character of the first string in `gr` is the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, 'NO' otherwise. The current value of the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the current value of the last character of the last string in `gr`. The current value of j is m - 1.***
