The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is 2. If the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is True. Otherwise, `impossible` is False.**
