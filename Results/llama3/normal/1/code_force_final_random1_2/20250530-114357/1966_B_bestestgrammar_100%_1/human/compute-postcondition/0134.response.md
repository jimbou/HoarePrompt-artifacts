Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `tc` is `t`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES' if the first character of the first string in `gr` is the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, 'NO' otherwise.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `tc` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The values of `n`, `m`, and `gr` will be the values from the last iteration of the loop. The value of `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last value it takes in the loop. The value of `ans` will be 'YES' if the first character of the first string in `gr` is the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, and 'NO' otherwise.
