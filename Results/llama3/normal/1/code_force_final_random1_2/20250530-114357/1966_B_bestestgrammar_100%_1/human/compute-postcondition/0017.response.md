State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is 1. If the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is True. Otherwise, `impossible` is False.**
