The only variable in the loop head is variable  tc, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc` and `t`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 1, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `tc` must be increased by 1, so `tc` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, and this is printed: 'YES' if the first character of the first string in `gr` is the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, 'NO' otherwise**
