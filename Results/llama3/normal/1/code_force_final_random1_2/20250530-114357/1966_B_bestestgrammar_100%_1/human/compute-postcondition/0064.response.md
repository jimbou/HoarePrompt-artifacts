Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, stdin contains no input, and `j` is 1. If the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr` or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` is True.***
