Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program checks if the first character of the first line is the same as the last character of the last line. If they are the same, it prints 'YES'. If they are different, it checks if there are any differences in the first or last columns or rows. If there are no differences, it prints 'NO', otherwise, it prints 'YES'. This logic is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
