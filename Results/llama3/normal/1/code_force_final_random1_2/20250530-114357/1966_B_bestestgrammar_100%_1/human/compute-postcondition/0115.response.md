Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m - 1`. If `impossible` is True, then `ans` is 'NO' and `impossible` is True. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES' if the first character of the first string in `gr` is the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, 'NO' otherwise.***
