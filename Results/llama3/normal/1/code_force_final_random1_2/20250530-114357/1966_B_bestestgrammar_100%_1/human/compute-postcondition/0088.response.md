Based on the precondition, the value of `ans` depends on the first character of the first string in `gr` and the last character of the last string in `gr`. If they are different, `ans` is 'NO'. If they are the same, `ans` is 'YES'. Since the exact strings in `gr` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'YES' or 'NO'.

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (where 'YES' indicates that the first character of the first string in gr is the same as the last character of the last string in gr, and 'NO' indicates that they are different)**
