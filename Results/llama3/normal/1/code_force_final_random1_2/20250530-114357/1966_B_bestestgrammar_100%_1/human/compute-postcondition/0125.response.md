Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 3, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is 3, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is False.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for `impossible`, which is now set to False. The value of `impossible` is no longer dependent on the conditions `gr[i][0]` not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`.
