Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES'**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 'YES', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `t` is still at least 1, `tc` is still 0, `n` and `m` are still integers, `gr` is still a list containing `n` strings, and `i` is still `n-1`. The stdin still contains no input.
