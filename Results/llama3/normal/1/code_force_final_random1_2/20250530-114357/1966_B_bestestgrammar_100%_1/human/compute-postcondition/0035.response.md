The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is 2, `j` is `m-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`. If for all `j`, the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES'. If the current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` is True.**
