According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing two strings, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2**
