Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, and the current value of the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the current value of the last character of the last string in `gr`. The current value of j is m - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to 'NO', while all other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` still holds true.
