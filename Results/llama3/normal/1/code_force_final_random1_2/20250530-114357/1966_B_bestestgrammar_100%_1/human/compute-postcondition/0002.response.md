Output State: **t is at least 1, tc is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, gr is an empty list, stdin contains no input**

The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n` and `m`. Since `t` is at least 1, and `tc` is 0, these values remain unchanged. The second line initializes an empty list `gr`. The third line does not affect any variables. After the code executes, `n` and `m` have integer values, `gr` is an empty list, and stdin is empty. The values of `t` and `tc` remain the same as in the initial state.
