The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1, and `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False if the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr` or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`, otherwise `impossible` is True, stdin contains no input, and `j` is 1**
