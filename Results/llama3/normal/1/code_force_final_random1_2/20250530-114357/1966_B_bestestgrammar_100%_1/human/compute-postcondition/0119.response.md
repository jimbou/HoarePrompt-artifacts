Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is 1, `j` is `m - 1`, `impossible` is False, `ans` is 'NO'. The current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`**

In this output state, the value of `impossible` has been changed to False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `j`, and `ans` are still valid, and the relationship between `gr[i][0]`, `gr[i + 1][0]`, `gr[i][m - 1]`, and `gr[i + 1][m - 1]` remains the same.
