To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, which means `n` must be at least 2 for `i` to be at least 1. 

State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is 1, `j` is `m - 1`, `impossible` is True, `ans` is 'NO'**
