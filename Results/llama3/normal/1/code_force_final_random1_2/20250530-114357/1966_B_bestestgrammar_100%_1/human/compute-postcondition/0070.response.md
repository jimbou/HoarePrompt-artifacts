Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, stdin contains no input, and `j` is `m - 1`.**

The code changes the value of `ans` from 'YES' to 'NO'. The values of the other variables remain the same. The state of `t` is still at least 2, `tc` is still 1, `n` and `m` are still integers, `gr` is still a list containing `n` strings, `i` is still `n`, `impossible` is still True, stdin still contains no input, and `j` is still `m - 1`.
