Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing three strings, `i` is 2, and 'YES' is printed if the first character of the string in gr is the same as the last character of the string in gr, 'NO' otherwise, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `gr` has been updated to include the new string input from stdin. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to input a string. The condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' remains the same, based on the first and last characters of the strings in `gr`.
