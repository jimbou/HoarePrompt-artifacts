According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make it more explicit, we can adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1.

Additionally, since `tc` is the loop variable, we can initialize it to 0, which is the starting value for the range function.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0**
