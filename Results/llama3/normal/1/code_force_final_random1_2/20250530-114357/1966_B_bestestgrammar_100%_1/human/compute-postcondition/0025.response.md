Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO', `j` is `m-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, and for all `j`, the current value of `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and the current value of `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to 'NO', while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `gr` still contains `n` strings, and the relationship between the characters in the first and last strings, as well as the relationship between the characters in the same string, remains the same.
