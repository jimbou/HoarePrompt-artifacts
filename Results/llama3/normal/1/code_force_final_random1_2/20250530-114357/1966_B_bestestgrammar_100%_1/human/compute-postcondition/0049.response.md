Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing one string, `i` is 0, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `impossible` is either True or False, stdin contains no input**

The code appends a string input to the list `gr`, which was initially empty. Since stdin contains no input, the input() function will wait for user input. Once a string is entered, it will be appended to `gr`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
