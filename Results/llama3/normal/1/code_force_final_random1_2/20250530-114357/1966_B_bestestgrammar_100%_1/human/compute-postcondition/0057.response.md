Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'YES', and `impossible` is True, stdin contains no input. The first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`.**

In this output state, the value of `impossible` has been updated to True, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The first character of the first string in `gr` is still not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr`, and stdin still contains no input.
