The only variable in the loop head is variable  tc and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable tc and t. If tc is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, tc is 0, t is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, tc must be increased by 1, so tc is 1 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `impossible` is either True or False**
