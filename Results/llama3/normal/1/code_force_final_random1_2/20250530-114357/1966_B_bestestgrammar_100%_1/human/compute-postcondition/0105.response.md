Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, and 'YES' is printed if the first character of the first string in `gr` is the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, 'NO' otherwise. The current value of the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the current value of the last character of the last string in `gr`. The current value of j is 0. If either the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, no change in the state of the variables. ***
