Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'NO', and `impossible` is False. The current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values and conditions, except for `impossible`, which is now set to False. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
