Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True, and 'YES' is printed if the first character of the first string in `gr` is the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, 'NO' otherwise. The current value of the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the current value of the last character of the last string in `gr`**

In this output state, the value of `impossible` has been set to True, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO' still depends on the first character of the first string in `gr` and the last character of the last string in `gr`, which are still not equal.
