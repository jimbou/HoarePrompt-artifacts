Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations.

The program first checks if the first character of the first line is the same as the last character of the last line. If they are the same, it prints 'YES'. This is because if the first and last characters are the same, it's possible to make all squares the same color by selecting the first and last characters and coloring all squares in between.

If the first and last characters are not the same, the program checks if there are any differences in the first or last columns or rows. If there are no differences, it prints 'NO', because it's impossible to make all squares the same color. If there are differences, it prints 'YES', because it's possible to make all squares the same color by selecting the different characters and coloring all squares in between.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
