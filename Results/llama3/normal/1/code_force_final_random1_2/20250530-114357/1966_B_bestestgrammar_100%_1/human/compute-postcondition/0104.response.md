Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, and 'YES' is printed if the first character of the first string in `gr` is the same as the last character of the last string in `gr`, 'NO' otherwise. The current value of the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the current value of the last character of the last string in `gr`. The current value of j is 0. Additionally, either the first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the first string in `gr`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` is not equal to the second character of the last string in `gr`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `impossible` has been changed to False. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
