Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 'NO'. If the current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is False. Otherwise, `impossible` remains True.***
