Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, and `j` is 1. If the first and second characters of the first and last strings in `gr` are different, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
