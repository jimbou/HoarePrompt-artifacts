Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is at least 3, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, stdin contains no input, and `j` is 1**

The value of `impossible` is set to False, regardless of its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. The output state is the same as the initial state, except that `impossible` is now False.
