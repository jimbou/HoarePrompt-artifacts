Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing three strings, `i` is 2, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `impossible` is either True or False, stdin contains no input**

The code `gr.append(input())` adds a new string to the end of the list `gr`. Since stdin contains no input, the `input()` function will wait for user input. Let's assume the user enters a string, for example, "hello". Then, `gr` will become a list containing three strings: the two original strings and the new string "hello". The values of the other variables are not affected.
