Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `impossible` is True, `ans` is 'NO'**

The code simply assigns the value 'NO' to the variable `ans`. Since `ans` already had the value 'NO' in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `ans`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
