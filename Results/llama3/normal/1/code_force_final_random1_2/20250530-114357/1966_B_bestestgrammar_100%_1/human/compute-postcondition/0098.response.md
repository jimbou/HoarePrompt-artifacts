Output State: **t is at least 3, tc is 2, n is an integer, m is an integer, gr is a list containing n strings, i is n-1, and 'YES' is printed if the first character of the first string in gr is the same as the last character of the last string in gr, 'NO' otherwise**

The loop will execute n times, appending n strings to the list gr. After the loop finishes, the value of i will be n-1, and the list gr will contain n strings. The output state will also include the condition for printing 'YES' or 'NO', which depends on the first character of the first string in gr being the same as the last character of the last string in gr.
