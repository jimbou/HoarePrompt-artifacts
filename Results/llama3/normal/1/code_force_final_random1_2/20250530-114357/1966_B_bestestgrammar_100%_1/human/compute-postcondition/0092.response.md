To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is at least 3, `tc` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and 'YES' is printed if the first character of the first string in gr is the same as the last character of the last string in gr, 'NO' otherwise**
