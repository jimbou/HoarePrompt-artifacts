Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer and must be at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing `x` elements which are equal to `l[i]` - `l[i - 1]` - 1, sorted by the key lambda function, `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` if `y` is greater than or equal to the sum of all `c`, otherwise `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` up to the point where `y` is less than `c` plus `y` * 2, `y` is 0 if `y` is greater than or equal to the sum of all `c`, otherwise `y` is reduced by the sum of all `c` up to the point where `y` is less than `c`, `cons` is `x` + `sx` - 2, `i` is the last element in the list `val`, `c` is the last element in the list `val` divided by 2, stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `l`, `val`, `sx`, `y`, `i`, and `c` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `cons` is now assigned the value of `x` + `sx` - 2. The stdin still contains `t` - 1 test cases.
