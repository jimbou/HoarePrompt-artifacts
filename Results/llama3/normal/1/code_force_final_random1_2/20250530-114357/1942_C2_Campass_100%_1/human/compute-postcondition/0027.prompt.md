Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, with even numbers first, then odd numbers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is x.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, with even numbers first, then odd numbers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the first element in the list, c is half of the first element in the list, sx is equal to its original value plus i plus 2 times y if y is less than c, otherwise sx is equal to its original value plus i, y is equal to its original value minus c.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, with even numbers first, then odd numbers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the next element in the list val, c is a quarter of the next element in the list val. If y is less than a quarter of the next element in the list val, sx is equal to its original value plus 3 times y, otherwise sx is equal to its original value plus the next element in the list val. y is equal to its original value minus a quarter of the next element in the list val.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, with even numbers first, then odd numbers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the next element in the list val, c is half of the next element in the list val, sx is equal to its original value plus i, y is equal to its original value minus c.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
