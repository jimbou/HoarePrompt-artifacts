The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be at least 2.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, n is an integer, x is an integer and must be at least 2, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing one element which is equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sx is 0, i is 2, c is l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, cons is undefined, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**
