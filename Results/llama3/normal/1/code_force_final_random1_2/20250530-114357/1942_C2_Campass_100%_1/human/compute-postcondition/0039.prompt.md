Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is an empty list, sx is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is not defined, c is not defined, cons is not defined, and the value of cons which is x + sx - 2 is not being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer and must be at least 1, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing one integer which is l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sx is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 1, c is l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, cons is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer and must be at least 1, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing two integers which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sx is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 2, c is l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, cons is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer and must be at least 2, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing three integers which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sx is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 3, c is l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, cons is not defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
