Postcondition: ***t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, with even numbers first, then odd numbers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the first element in the list, c is half of the first element in the list, val must have at least 1 element. If y is less than c, sx is equal to its original value plus 2 times y. Otherwise, sx remains unchanged.***
