Output State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, with even numbers first, then odd numbers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the next element in the list val, c is a quarter of the next element in the list val, sx is equal to its original value plus the next element in the list val plus 2 times y if y is less than a quarter of the next element in the list val, otherwise sx is equal to its original value plus the next element in the list val, y is equal to its original value minus a quarter of the next element in the list val.**

In this output state, the value of c has been updated to be a quarter of the next element in the list val. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
