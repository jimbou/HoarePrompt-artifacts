Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4).
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `l` minus 1, with even numbers first, then odd numbers, `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases, `i` is the last element in the list `val`, `c` is half of the last element in the list `val`, `sx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in `val`, `y` is equal to its original value minus the sum of half of all elements in `val`, `cons` is `x` + `sx` - 2, and the value of `cons` which is `x` + `sx` - 2 is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer and must be at least 1, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is a list, `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` if `y` is greater than or equal to all `c`, otherwise `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` up to the point where `y` is less than `c` plus 2 * `y`, `i` is the last element in the list `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `cons` is `x + sx - 2`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, and cons is printed ,cons (where cons is the value of `x + sx - 2`)
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer and must be at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing `x` elements which are equal to `l[i]` - `l[i - 1]` - 1, sorted by the key lambda function, `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` if `y` is greater than or equal to the sum of all `c`, otherwise `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` up to the point where `y` is less than `c` plus `y` * 2, `y` is 0 if `y` is greater than or equal to the sum of all `c`, otherwise `y` is reduced by the sum of all `c` up to the point where `y` is less than `c`, `cons` is `x` + `sx` - 2, `i` is the last element in the list `val`, `c` is the last element in the list `val` divided by 2, stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases, and the value of cons which is x + sx - 2 is printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
