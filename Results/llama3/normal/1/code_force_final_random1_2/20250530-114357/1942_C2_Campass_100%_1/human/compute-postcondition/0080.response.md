Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, n is an integer, x is an integer and must be at least 1, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least 2 elements which are equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda function, sx is i + 2 * (y - c) if y is less than c, otherwise sx is i since y is not less than c, c is i // 2, cons is undefined, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the second element in the list val.***
