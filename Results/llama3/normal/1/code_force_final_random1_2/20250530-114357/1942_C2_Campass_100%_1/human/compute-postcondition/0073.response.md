Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer and must be at least 1, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing at least 1 element which are equal to `l[i]` - `l[i - 1]` - 1, sorted by the key lambda function, `sx` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `cons` is undefined, stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases. The current value of `y` is less than `c`***
