Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer and must be at least 1, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing `x` integers which are `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, sorted by the value of the number and then by whether the number is odd or even, `sx` is 0, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is `x`, `c` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, `cons` is not defined.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer and must be at least 1, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing x integers which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the value of the number and then by whether the number is odd or even and must have at least 1 element, sx is 0 + 2 * y if y is less than c, otherwise sx is i, i is the first element in the list val, c is i // 2, cons is not defined, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer and must be at least 1, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing x - 1 integers which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the value of the number and then by whether the number is odd or even and must have at least 1 element, sx is 0 + 2 * y if y is less than i // 2, otherwise sx is i, i is the second element in the list val, c is i // 2, cons is not defined, stdin contains t - 1 test cases. If y is less than c, then sx is 0 + 2 * y and y is y, otherwise sx is i + i and y is y - i // 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer and must be at least 1, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing x - 1 integers which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the value of the number and then by whether the number is odd or even and must have at least 2 elements, sx is 0 + 2 * y if y is less than i // 2, otherwise sx is i, i is the third element in the list val, c is now equal to i // 2, cons is not defined, stdin contains t - 1 test cases. If y is less than c, then sx is 0 + 2 * y and y is y, otherwise sx is i + i and y is y - i // 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
