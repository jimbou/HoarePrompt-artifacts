Functionality: This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is the total number of elements, x is the number of distinct integers, and y is a threshold value. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive integers in the sorted list, excluding the first and last elements, and adds the minimum of y and half of each difference to the sum. Finally, it prints the result, which is the sum of x and the calculated sum minus 2, for each test case.
