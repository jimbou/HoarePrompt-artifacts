Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, n is an integer, x is an integer and must be at least 1, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements which are equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda function, sx is i + 2 * (y - c) if y is less than c, otherwise sx is i since y is not less than c, cons is undefined, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the third element in the list val, y is reduced by c, sx is increased by i, c is the third element in the list val divided by 2, sx is increased by y * 2**.

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `t` remains an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2. The value of `n` remains an integer. The value of `x` remains an integer and must be at least 1. The list `l` remains a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` + the first element of `l` appended to the end. The list `val` remains a sorted list containing at least 3 elements which are equal to `l[i]` - `l[i - 1]` - 1, sorted by the key lambda function. The value of `sx` is increased by `y` * 2, in addition to its previous value which was `i` + 2 * (`y` - `c`) if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise `sx` is `i` since `y` is not less than `c`. The value of `cons` remains undefined. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t` - 1. The value of `i` remains the third element in the list `val`. The value of `y` remains reduced by `c`. The value of `c` remains the third element in the list `val` divided by 2.
