Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer and must be at least 1, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing two integers which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sx is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 2, c is l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, cons is not defined.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` to `c`. Since `i` is 2, this expression evaluates to the difference between the second and first elements of `l`, minus 1. The second line appends the value of `c` to the list `val`. 

As a result, the value of `c` is updated to the difference between the second and first elements of `l`, minus 1, and the list `val` now contains two integers, both of which are equal to `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
