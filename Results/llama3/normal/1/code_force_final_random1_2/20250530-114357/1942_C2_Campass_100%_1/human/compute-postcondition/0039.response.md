Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer and must be at least 1, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing x integers which are l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sx is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is x, c is l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, cons is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the variable `i` has reached the value of `x`. The list `val` now contains `x` integers, each representing the difference between consecutive elements in the list `l`, minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
