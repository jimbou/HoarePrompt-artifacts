Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, n is an integer, x is an integer and must be at least 1, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least 1 element which are equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sorted by the key lambda function, sx is 2 * y + i if y is less than c, otherwise sx is i, c is i // 2, cons is undefined, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the first element in the list val, y is y - c**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `l`, `val`, `c`, `cons`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `sx` is updated to be `2 * y + i` if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise it is `i`. The value of `y` is updated to be `y - c`. The value of `i` remains the same as it was not modified by the code.
