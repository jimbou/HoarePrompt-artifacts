To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i` and the list `val`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current element in the list `val`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be the next element in the list `val`.

Since `val` is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `l` minus 1, with even numbers first, then odd numbers, we can assume that the next element in `val` is the next difference between consecutive elements of `l` minus 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, with even numbers first, then odd numbers, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the next element in the list val, c is a quarter of the next element in the list val. If y is less than a quarter of the next element in the list val, sx is equal to its original value plus 3 times y, otherwise sx is equal to its original value plus the next element in the list val. y is equal to its original value minus a quarter of the next element in the list val.**
