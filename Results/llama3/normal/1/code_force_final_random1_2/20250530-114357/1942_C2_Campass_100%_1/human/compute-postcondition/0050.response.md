Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer and must be at least 1, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing `x - 1` integers which are `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, sorted by the value of the number and then by whether the number is odd or even and must have at least 1 element, `sx` is 0 + 2 * `y` if `y` is less than `i // 2`, otherwise `sx` is `i`, `i` is the second element in the list `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `cons` is not defined, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases. If `y` is less than `c`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
