Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, n is an integer, x is an integer and must be at least 1, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing x elements which are equal to l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, sx is 0, i is x, c is l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1, cons is undefined, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `x`, and the list `val` will contain `x` elements, each of which is equal to the difference between consecutive elements in the list `l`, minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
