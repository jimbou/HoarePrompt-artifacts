Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer and must be at least 1, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is an empty list, `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` if `y` is greater than or equal to all `c`, otherwise `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` up to the point where `y` is less than `c` plus 2 * `y`, `i` is the last element in the list `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `cons` is `x + sx - 2`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cons` has been calculated and assigned as `x + sx - 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases.
