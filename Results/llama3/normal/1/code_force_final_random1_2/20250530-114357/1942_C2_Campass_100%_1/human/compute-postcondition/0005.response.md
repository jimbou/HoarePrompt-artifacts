To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is at least 1.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be at least 2, `y` is an integer, `sx` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is a list containing the difference between the second element of `l` and the first element of `l` minus 1, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 2**
