The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer and must be at least 1, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is a list, `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` if `y` is greater than or equal to all `c`, otherwise `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` up to the point where `y` is less than `c` plus 2 * `y`, `i` is the last element in the list `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `cons` is `x + sx - 2`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, and cons is printed ,cons (where cons is the value of `x + sx - 2`)**
