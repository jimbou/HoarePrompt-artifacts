Based on the given initial state, let's break down the variables and their values:

*   `t` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1.
*   `n` is an integer.
*   `x` is an integer.
*   `y` is an integer.
*   `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` + the first element of `l` appended to the end.
*   `val` is a sorted list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `l` minus 1, with even numbers first, then odd numbers.
*   `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases.
*   `i` is the last element in the list `val`.
*   `c` is half of the last element in the list `val`.
*   `sx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in `val`.
*   `y` is equal to its original value minus the sum of half of all elements in `val`.
*   `cons` is `x` + `sx` - 2.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(cons)`

The `cons` variable is calculated as `x` + `sx` - 2. To determine the value of `cons`, we need to understand the values of `x` and `sx`.

*   `x` is an integer.
*   `sx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in `val`. Since `val` contains the differences between consecutive elements of `l` minus 1, the sum of all elements in `val` represents the total difference between consecutive elements in `l` minus the number of elements in `l` (since each difference is minus 1).

Considering the structure of the problem, the exact values of `x` and `sx` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n`, `l`, and `val`. However, we can describe the value of `cons` in terms of these variables.

Output: **x + (original value of sx + sum of all elements in val) - 2 (where x is an integer, sx is the sum of all elements in val plus its original value, and val contains the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1)**
