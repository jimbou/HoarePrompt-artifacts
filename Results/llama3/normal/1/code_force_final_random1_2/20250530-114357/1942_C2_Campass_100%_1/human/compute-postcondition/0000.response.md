Output State: **stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4).**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into integers, and returns them as a map. Then, it reads the first line from stdin, which contains a single integer `t`, and assigns it to the variable `t`. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The remaining input in stdin consists of `t` test cases, each with two lines. The first line of each test case contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` is between 4 and 10^9 (inclusive), `x` is between 2 and the minimum of `n` and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and `y` is between 0 and `n - x` (inclusive). The second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
