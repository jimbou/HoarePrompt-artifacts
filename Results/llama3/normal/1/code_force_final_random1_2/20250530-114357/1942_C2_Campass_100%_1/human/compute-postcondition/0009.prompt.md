Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is an empty list, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer that must be at least 1, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer that must be at least 2, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, and the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer that must be at least 3, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, and the difference between the fourth element of l and the third element of l minus 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
