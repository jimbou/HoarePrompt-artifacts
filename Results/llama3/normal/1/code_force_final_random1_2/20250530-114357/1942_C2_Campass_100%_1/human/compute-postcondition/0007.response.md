According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be at least 3.
State: **t is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, n is an integer, x is an integer that must be at least 3, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, with n + the first element of l appended to the end, val is a list containing the difference between the second element of l and the first element of l minus 1, and the difference between the third element of l and the second element of l minus 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 3**
