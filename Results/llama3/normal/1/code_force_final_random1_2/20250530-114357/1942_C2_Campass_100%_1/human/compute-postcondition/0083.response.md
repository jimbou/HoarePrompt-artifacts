Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer and must be at least 1, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` + the first element of `l` appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements which are equal to `l[i]` - `l[i - 1]` - 1, sorted by the key lambda function, `sx` is `i` + 2 * (`y` - `c`) if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise `sx` is `i` since `y` is not less than `c`, `cons` is undefined, `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases, `i` is the third element in the list `val`, `y` is reduced by `c`, `sx` is increased by `i`, `c` is the third element in the list `val` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `c` has been updated to be the third element in the list `val` divided by 2.
