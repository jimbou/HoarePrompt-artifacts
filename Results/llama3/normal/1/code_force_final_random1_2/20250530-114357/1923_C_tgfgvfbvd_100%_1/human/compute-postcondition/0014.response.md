Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, p is a list containing four elements: 0, the value of i after the first line of code, the value of i after the second line of code, and the value of i after the third line of code, c is a list containing four elements: 0, the value of j, the value of j, and the value of j, i is equal to its original value plus the first integer in the list l plus the second integer in the list l plus the third integer in the list l, j is equal to its original value plus 1 if the third integer in the list l is equal to 1, otherwise j is equal to its original value, _ is equal to its original value, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input, x is the third integer in the list l.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been updated to include the third integer in the list `l`, which is `x`. The list `p` now contains four elements, including the updated value of `i` after the third line of code. The list `c` also contains four elements, with the last element being the updated value of `j` if `x` is equal to 1. The value of `j` has been updated to be one more than its original value if `x` is equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
