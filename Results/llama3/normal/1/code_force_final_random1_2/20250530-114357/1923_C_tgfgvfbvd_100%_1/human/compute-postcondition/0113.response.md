The code snippet consists of four lines, each of which affects the state of the program in a specific way. The first line assigns the values of `a` and `b` to the result of `map(int, input().split())`, which means that `a` and `b` are now integers. The second line assigns the value of `c[b] - c[a - 1]` to `i`, which means that `i` is now equal to the difference between the `b`-th element of `c` and the `(a - 1)`-th element of `c`. The third line assigns the value of `p[b] - p[a - 1]` to `s`, which means that `s` is now equal to the difference between the `b`-th element of `p` and the `(a - 1)`-th element of `p`. The fourth line does not affect any variables.

The initial state of the program is as follows: `n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing `len(l) + len(l)` elements: 0 and the value of `i` plus the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `c` is a list containing `len(l) + len(l)` elements: 0 and the value of `j`, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `j` is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list `l`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is 0, and `stdin` contains no input.

After the code executes, the state of the program is as follows: `n` is still an integer, `m` is still 0, `l` is still a list of integers, `p` is still a list containing `len(l) + len(l)` elements: 0 and the value of `i` plus the sum of all integers in the list `l`, `c` is still a list containing `len(l) + len(l)` elements: 0 and the value of `j`, `i` is now equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `a` is now an integer, `b` is now an integer, `s` is now equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `j` is still equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list `l`, `x` is still the last integer in the list `l`, `_` is still 0, and `stdin` contains no input.

In summary, the code snippet affects the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s`, but does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `j`, `x`, or `_`. The final state of the program is the same as the initial state, except for the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s`, which are now updated based on the input values.
