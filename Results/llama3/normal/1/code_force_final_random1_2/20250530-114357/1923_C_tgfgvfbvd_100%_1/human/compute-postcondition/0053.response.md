Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list containing `len(l) + 3` elements: 0, the original value of `i`, the value of `i` after the first line of code, and the new value of `i` after the code executes, `c` is a list containing `len(l) + 3` elements: 0, the original value of `j`, the value of `j` after the second line of code, and the value of `j` after the code executes, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]` plus the next element in the list `l` plus the third element in the list `l`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `x` is the third element in the list `l`. If `x` is 1, `j` is equal to its original value plus 2. Otherwise, `j` is equal to its original value plus 1. `stdin` contains no input.***
