Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is greater than 0, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing len(l) + len(l) elements: 0 and the value of i after each line of code, c is a list containing len(l) + len(l) elements: 0 and the value of j after each line of code, i is equal to 0, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to 0, x is the last integer in the list l, j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l, stdin contains no input. Either (b - a + 1) is less than or equal to 1 or s - (b - a + 1) is less than i***
