This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer n, followed by two space-separated integers, a space-separated list of integers, and multiple space-separated pairs of integers. The function calculates the cumulative sum and count of 1's in the list of integers, then for each pair of integers, it checks if the sum of the corresponding subarray minus its length is greater than or equal to the count of 1's in that subarray. If the condition is met and the subarray has more than one element, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
