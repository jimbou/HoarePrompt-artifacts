Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing len(l) + 2 elements: 0, the value of i, and the value of i plus x, `c` is a list containing len(l) + 2 elements: 0, the value of j, and the value of j, `i` is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] plus the sum of all integers in the list l plus x, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], `j` is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l plus 1 if the first integer in the list l is 1, otherwise j remains unchanged. If x is equal to 1, then `j` is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l plus 2 if the first integer in the list l is 1, otherwise j remains unchanged plus 1. `x` is the next integer in the list l***
