Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, p is a list containing len(l) + 4 elements: 0, the original value of i, the value of i after the first line of code, the new value of i after the code executes, and the new value of i after the last line of code, c is a list containing len(l) + 4 elements: 0, the original value of j, the value of j after the second line of code, the value of j after the code executes, and the value of j after the last line of code, i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] plus the next element in the list l plus the third element in the list l plus x, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], x is the third element in the list l, j is equal to its original value plus 2 if x is 1, otherwise j is equal to its original value plus 1, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by `x`, which is the third element in the list `l`. The list `p` has been appended with the new value of `i`, and the list `c` has been appended with the new value of `j`. The value of `j` has been incremented by 2 if `x` is 1, otherwise it has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
