Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of `i` after each line of code, `c` is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of `j` after each line of code, `i` is equal to `c[b]` - `c[a - 1]`, `j` is equal to its original value plus 1 if the first integer in the list `l` is 1, otherwise `j` is equal to its original value, `stdin` contains no input, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to `p[b]` - `p[a - 1]`.***
