Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of i, `c` is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of j, `i` is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] plus the sum of all integers in the list l, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], `x` is 1, `j` is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l plus 1, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains at least one element, and the lists `p` and `c` still contain `len(l) + 1` elements. The values of `i`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and `x` are still the same. There is no input in stdin.
