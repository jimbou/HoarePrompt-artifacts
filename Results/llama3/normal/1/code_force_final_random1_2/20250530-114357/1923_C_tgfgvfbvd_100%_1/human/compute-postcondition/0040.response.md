The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input. For the loop to execute again _ must be 1 and stdin contains at least one test case minus one line of input.
State: **n is an integer, m is 1, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of i after each line of code, c is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of j after each line of code, i is equal to its original value plus the sum of all integers in the list l, j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l, stdin contains at least one test case minus one line of input, x is the last integer in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1]**
