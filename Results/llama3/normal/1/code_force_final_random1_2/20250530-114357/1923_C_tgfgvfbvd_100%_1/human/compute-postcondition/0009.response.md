Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, p is a list containing two elements: 0 and the value of i after the first line of code, c is a list containing two elements: 0 and the value of j, i is equal to its original value plus the first integer in the list l, j is equal to its original value, _ is equal to its original value, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input, x is the second integer in the list l. If x is equal to 1, then j is equal to its original value plus 1 and c is a list containing two elements: 0 and the value of j plus 1. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
