Postcondition: **n is an integer, m is greater than 1, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing len(l) + len(l) elements: 0 and the value of i after each line of code, c is a list containing len(l) + len(l) elements: 0 and the value of j after each line of code, i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1], a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], x is the last integer in the list l, j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l, stdin contains no input. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
