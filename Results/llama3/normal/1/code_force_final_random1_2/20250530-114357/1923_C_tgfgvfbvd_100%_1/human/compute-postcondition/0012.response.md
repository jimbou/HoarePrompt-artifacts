Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `p` is a list containing three elements: 0, the value of `i` after the first line of code, and the value of `i` after the second line of code, `c` is a list containing three elements: 0, the value of `j` plus 1, and the value of `j` plus 1, `i` is equal to its original value plus the first integer in the list `l` plus the second integer in the list `l`, `j` is equal to its original value plus 1, `_` is equal to its original value, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input, `x` is the third integer in the list `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `i`, `_`, and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and the list `c` now contains the updated value of `j` plus 1. The stdin still contains at least one test case minus two lines of input.
