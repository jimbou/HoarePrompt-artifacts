Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing a single element 0, c is a list containing a single element 0, i is 0, j is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input**.

The code reads two lines of input from stdin, assigning the first line to `n` and `m` and the second line to `l`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `l` are integers. The code then initializes `p` and `c` as lists containing a single element 0, and `i` and `j` as 0. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains at least one test case minus two lines of input.
