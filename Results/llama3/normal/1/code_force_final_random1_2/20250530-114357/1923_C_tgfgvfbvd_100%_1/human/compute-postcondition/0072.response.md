To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(m):`, which means the loop will execute as long as the range of `m` has not been exhausted.

At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, the value of `m` must still be greater than 0, because the range function will stop when it reaches 0.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, its value does not affect the loop's execution. However, we can infer that the loop will execute again if `m` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing len(l) + len(l) elements: 0 and the value of `i` after each line of code, `c` is a list containing len(l) + len(l) elements: 0 and the value of `j` after each line of code, `i` is equal to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `x` is the last integer in the list `l`, `j` is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list `l`, `stdin` contains no input.**
