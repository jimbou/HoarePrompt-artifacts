Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of i after each line of code, c is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of j after each line of code, i is equal to its original value plus the sum of all integers in the list l, j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l, stdin contains no input, x is the last integer in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1].
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, p is a list containing len(l) + 2 elements: 0, the value of i after each line of code, and the new value of i after the code executes, c is a list containing len(l) + 2 elements: 0, the value of j after each line of code, and the value of j after the code executes, i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] plus x, j is equal to its original value plus 1 if the first integer in the list l is 1, otherwise j is equal to its original value, stdin contains no input, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing len(l) + 3 elements: 0, the original value of i, the value of i after the first line of code, and the new value of i after the code executes, c is a list containing len(l) + 3 elements: 0, the original value of j, the value of j after the second line of code, and the value of j after the code executes, i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] plus x plus the second element in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], x is the second element in the list l, j is equal to its original value plus 1 if the second element in the list l is 1, otherwise j is equal to its original value, stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, p is a list containing len(l) + 4 elements: 0, the original value of i, the value of i after the first line of code, the new value of i after the code executes, and the new value of i after the last line of code, c is a list containing len(l) + 4 elements: 0, the original value of j, the value of j after the second line of code, the value of j after the code executes, and the value of j after the last line of code, i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] plus the next element in the list l plus the third element in the list l plus x, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], x is the third element in the list l, j is equal to its original value plus 2 if x is 1, otherwise j is equal to its original value plus 1, stdin contains no input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
