Postcondition: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing len(l) + 2 elements: 0, the value of i after each line of code, and the new value of i after the code executes, c is a list containing len(l) + 2 elements: 0, the value of j after each line of code, and the value of j after the code executes, i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] plus x, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], x is the second element in the list l, stdin contains no input. If the second element in the list l is 1, then j is equal to its original value plus 1. Otherwise, j is equal to its original value.**
