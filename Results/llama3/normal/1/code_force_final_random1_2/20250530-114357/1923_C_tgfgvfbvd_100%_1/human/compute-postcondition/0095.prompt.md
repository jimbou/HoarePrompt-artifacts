Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of i, c is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of j, i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] plus the sum of all integers in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], x is the last integer in the list l, j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, p is a list containing len(l) + 2 elements: 0, the value of i, and the value of i plus x, c is a list containing len(l) + 2 elements: 0, the value of j, and the value of j, i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] plus the sum of all integers in the list l plus x, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], if the first integer in the list l is 1, then j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l plus 1. Otherwise, j remains unchanged. stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, p is a list containing len(l) + 3 elements: 0, the value of i, the value of i plus x, and the value of i plus 2x, c is a list containing len(l) + 3 elements: 0, the value of j, the value of j, and the value of j, i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] plus the sum of all integers in the list l plus 2x, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l plus 1 if the first integer in the list l is 1, otherwise j remains unchanged. If x is equal to 1, then j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l plus 2 if the first integer in the list l is 1, otherwise j remains unchanged plus 1. x is the next integer in the list l

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, p is a list containing len(l) + 4 elements: 0, the value of i, the value of i plus x, the value of i plus 2x, and the value of i plus 3x, c is a list containing len(l) + 4 elements: 0, the value of j, the value of j, the value of j, and the value of j, i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] plus the sum of all integers in the list l plus 3x, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l plus 1 if the first integer in the list l is 1, otherwise j remains unchanged. If x is equal to 1, then j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l plus 2 if the first integer in the list l is 1, otherwise j remains unchanged plus 1. x is the third integer in the list l




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
