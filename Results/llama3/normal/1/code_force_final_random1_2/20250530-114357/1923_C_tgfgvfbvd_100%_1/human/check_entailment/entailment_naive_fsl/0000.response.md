Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". 

The program first calculates the prefix sum of the array `l` and the count of 1's in the array. Then, for each query, it checks if the subarray from `a` to `b` is good by verifying the following conditions:

1. The sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to the number of 1's in the subarray plus the length of the subarray minus one. This ensures that there are enough elements in the subarray to replace each 1 with a 2 and still have a sum equal to the original sum.
2. The length of the subarray is greater than 1. This is because a single-element subarray cannot be good, as the element cannot be replaced with a different value.

If both conditions are met, the program prints "YES", indicating that the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including edge cases such as a single-element subarray, a subarray with only one 1, and a subarray with no 1's. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
