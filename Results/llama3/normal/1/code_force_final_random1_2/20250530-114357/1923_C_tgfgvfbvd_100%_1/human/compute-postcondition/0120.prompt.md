Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple space-separated pairs of integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [0]
    c = [0]
    i, j = 0, 0
    for x in l:
        if x == 1:
            j += 1
        i += x
        p.append(i)
        c.append(j)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
        s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is 0, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of i after each line of code, c is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of j after each line of code, i is equal to its original value plus the sum of all integers in the list l, j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l, _ is m, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input, x is the last integer in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1]. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is equal to 0, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing len(l) + len(l) elements: 0 and the value of i after each line of code, c is a list containing len(l) + len(l) elements: 0 and the value of j after each line of code, i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] plus the sum of all integers in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], x is the last integer in the list l, j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l, stdin contains no input. If b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is 0, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing len(l) + len(l) elements: 0 and the value of i plus the sum of all integers in the list l, c is a list containing len(l) + len(l) elements: 0 and the value of j, i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1], a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l, x is the last integer in the list l, _ is 0, stdin contains no input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
