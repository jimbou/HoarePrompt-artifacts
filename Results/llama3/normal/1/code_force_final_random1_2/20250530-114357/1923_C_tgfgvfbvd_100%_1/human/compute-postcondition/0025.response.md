State: **n is an integer, m is greater than 0, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of i after each line of code, c is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of j after each line of code, i is equal to its original value plus the sum of all integers in the list l, j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l, _ is 1, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input, x is the last integer in the list l, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1]. If the difference between b and a plus 1 is greater than 1 and the difference between s and the difference between b and a plus 1 is greater than or equal to i, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, either (b - a + 1 is less than or equal to 1) or (s - (b - a + 1) is less than i), and 'NO' is printed.**
