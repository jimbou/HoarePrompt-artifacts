Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing `len(l)` + 2 elements: 0, the value of `i` after each line of code, and the new value of `i` after the code executes, `c` is a list containing `len(l)` + 2 elements: 0, the value of `j` after each line of code, and the value of `j` after the code executes, `i` is equal to `c[b]` - `c[a - 1]` plus `x`, `j` is equal to its original value plus 1 if the first integer in the list `l` is 1, otherwise `j` is equal to its original value plus 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to `p[b]` - `p[a - 1]`, `x` is the second element in the list `l`, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still equal to `c[b]` - `c[a - 1]` plus `x`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, regardless of the first integer in the list `l`. The lists `p` and `c` still contain the same number of elements, but the value of `j` in list `c` is updated. The stdin remains empty.
