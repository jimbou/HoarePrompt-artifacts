Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, p is a list containing len(l) + 3 elements: 0, the value of i, the value of i plus x, and the value of i plus 2x, c is a list containing len(l) + 3 elements: 0, the value of j, the value of j, and the value of j, i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1] plus the sum of all integers in the list l plus 2x, a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l plus 1 if the first integer in the list l is 1, otherwise j remains unchanged. If x is equal to 1, then j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l plus 2 if the first integer in the list l is 1, otherwise j remains unchanged plus 1. x is the third integer in the list l***
