To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is at least one test case in the input. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is at least one test case in the input.

State: **stdin contains at least one test case, `_` is 0**
