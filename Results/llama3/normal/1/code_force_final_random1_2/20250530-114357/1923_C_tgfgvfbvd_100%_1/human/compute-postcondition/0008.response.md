Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `p` is a list containing two elements: 0 and the value of `i` after the first line of code, `c` is a list containing two elements: 0 and the value of `j` plus 1, `i` is equal to its original value plus the first integer in the list `l`, `j` is equal to its original value plus 1, `_` is equal to its original value, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input, `x` is the second integer in the list `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `c` has been updated to reflect this change. The other variables remain unchanged.
