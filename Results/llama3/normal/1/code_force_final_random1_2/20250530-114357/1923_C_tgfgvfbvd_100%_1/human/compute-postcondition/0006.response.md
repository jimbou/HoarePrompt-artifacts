Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, p is a list containing two elements: 0 and the value of i after the first line of code, c is a list containing two elements: 0 and the value of j, i is equal to its original value plus the first integer in the list l, j is equal to its original value, _ is equal to its original value, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input.**

The first line of code increments the value of `i` by the first integer in the list `l`. The second line appends the new value of `i` to the list `p`. The third line appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. The values of `n`, `m`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
