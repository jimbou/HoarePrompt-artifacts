Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good" as per the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program calculates the cumulative sum `p` and count of 1's `c` in the input array `l`. This is done correctly using list comprehensions and the `append` method.

2. For each query, the program calculates the sum `s` of the subarray and the count `i` of 1's in the subarray. This is done correctly using the cumulative sum and count arrays.

3. The program then checks if the subarray is "good" by checking if the sum `s` minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count `i` of 1's. This is the correct condition as per the problem description.

4. The program also checks if the subarray has more than one element, which is a necessary condition for a subarray to be "good".

5. Finally, the program prints 'YES' if the subarray is "good" and 'NO' otherwise, which is the correct output format as per the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
