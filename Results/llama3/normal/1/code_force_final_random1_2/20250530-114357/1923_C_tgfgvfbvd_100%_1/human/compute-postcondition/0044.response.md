Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of `i` after each line of code, `c` is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of `j` after each line of code, `i` is equal to `c[b]` - `c[a - 1]`, `j` is equal to its original value plus 1, `stdin` contains no input, the first integer in the list `l` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to `p[b]` - `p[a - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still equal to the difference between the `b`-th and `(a-1)`-th elements of list `c`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 from its original value. The first element of list `l` is still 1, and there is no input in `stdin`.
