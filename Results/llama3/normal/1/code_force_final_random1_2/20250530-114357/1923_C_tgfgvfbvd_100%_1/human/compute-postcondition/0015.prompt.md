Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing a single element 0, c is a list containing a single element 0, i is 0, j is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    if x == 1:
        j += 1
    i += x
    p.append(i)
    c.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, p is a list containing two elements: 0 and the value of i after the first line of code, c is a list containing two elements: 0 and the value of j, i is equal to its original value plus the first integer in the list l, j is equal to its original value, _ is equal to its original value, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, p is a list containing three elements: 0, the value of i after the first line of code, and the value of i after the second line of code, c is a list containing three elements: 0, the value of j, and the value of j, i is equal to its original value plus the first integer in the list l plus the second integer in the list l, j is equal to its original value, _ is equal to its original value, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input, x is the second integer in the list l. If x is equal to 1, then j is equal to its original value plus 1 and c is a list containing three elements: 0, the value of j, and the value of j plus 1. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, p is a list containing four elements: 0, the value of i after the first line of code, the value of i after the second line of code, and the value of i after the third line of code, c is a list containing four elements: 0, the value of j, the value of j, and the value of j, i is equal to its original value plus the first integer in the list l plus the second integer in the list l plus the third integer in the list l, j is equal to its original value plus 1 if the third integer in the list l is equal to 1, otherwise j is equal to its original value, _ is equal to its original value, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input, x is the third integer in the list l.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
