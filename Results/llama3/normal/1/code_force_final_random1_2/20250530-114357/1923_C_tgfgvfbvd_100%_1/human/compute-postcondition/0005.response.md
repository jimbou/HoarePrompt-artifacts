Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `p` is a list containing a single element 0, `c` is a list containing a single element 0, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two lines of input. If the first integer in the list `l`, `x`, is equal to 1, then `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `_` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, and `_` remain unchanged.***
