Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `p` is a list containing `len(l)` + 3 elements: 0, the value of `i`, the value of `i` plus `l[2]`, and the value of `i` plus 2*`l[2]`, `c` is a list containing `len(l)` + 3 elements: 0, the value of `j` + 1, the value of `j` + 1, and the value of `j` + 1, `i` is equal to `c[b]` - `c[a - 1]` plus the sum of all integers in the list `l` plus 2*`l[2]`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `s` is equal to `p[b]` - `p[a - 1]`, `j` is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list `l` plus 1 if the first integer in the list `l` is 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The list `c` now contains the value of `j` + 1 in its second, third, and fourth positions. The value of `j` is still dependent on the number of 1's in the list `l` and the first integer in the list `l`.
