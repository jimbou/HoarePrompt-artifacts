The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, l has at least 2 integers, x is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the x is the third integer in the list.
State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, p is a list containing three elements: 0, the value of i after the first line of code, and the value of i after the second line of code, c is a list containing three elements: 0, the value of j, and the value of j, i is equal to its original value plus the first integer in the list l plus the second integer in the list l, j is equal to its original value, _ is equal to its original value, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input, x is the third integer in the list l**
