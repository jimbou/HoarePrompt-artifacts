Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `m`, the array `l` itself, and the queries (pairs of integers `a` and `b`).

2. It initializes two lists `p` and `c` to keep track of the prefix sum and the count of 1's in the array `l`, respectively.

3. It then iterates over the array `l` and updates the prefix sum `i` and the count of 1's `j` accordingly. The prefix sum `p` and the count of 1's `c` are updated at each step.

4. For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray `s` and the count of 1's `i` in the subarray.

5. It then checks if the subarray is good by checking if the length of the subarray is greater than 1 and if the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1's in the subarray. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

6. The program correctly handles the case where the length of the subarray is 1, in which case it always prints 'NO'.

7. The program also correctly handles the case where the sum of the subarray is equal to the length of the subarray, in which case it prints 'NO' if there are any 1's in the subarray.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
