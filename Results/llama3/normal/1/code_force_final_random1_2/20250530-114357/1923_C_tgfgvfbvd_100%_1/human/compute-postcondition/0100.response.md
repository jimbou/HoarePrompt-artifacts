Output: **n is an integer, m is greater than 0, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing len(l) + len(l) elements: 0 and the value of i plus the sum of all integers in the list l, c is a list containing len(l) + len(l) elements: 0 and the value of j, i is equal to c[b] - c[a - 1], a is an integer, b is an integer, s is equal to p[b] - p[a - 1], j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l, x is the last integer in the list l, _ is 0. The current value of b minus a plus 1 is greater than 1, and the current value of s minus the value of b minus a plus 1 is greater than or equal to the current value of i, and 'YES' is printed**
