Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, l is a list of integers, p is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of i after each line of code, c is a list containing len(l) + 1 elements: 0 and the value of j after each line of code, i is equal to its original value plus the sum of all integers in the list l, j is equal to its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l, _ is equal to its original value, stdin contains at least one test case minus two lines of input, x is the last integer in the list l.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of n, m, and _ remain unchanged. The list l remains the same, but its length is now known to be at least the number of iterations of the loop. The list p contains the initial value 0, followed by the value of i after each iteration of the loop. The list c contains the initial value 0, followed by the value of j after each iteration of the loop. The value of i is the sum of its original value and all the integers in the list l. The value of j is its original value plus the number of 1's in the list l. The value of x is the last integer in the list l.
