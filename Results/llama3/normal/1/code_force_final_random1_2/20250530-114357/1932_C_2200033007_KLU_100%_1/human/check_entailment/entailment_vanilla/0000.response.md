Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the modulus value `m`, the array `a`, and the string of commands `s`.

3. The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands and calculate the remainders.

4. Inside `func_1`, it initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of `a` in the order they are removed, and two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the left and right ends of the array `a`.

5. It then iterates over the string of commands `s`. If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments `l`. If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements `r`.

6. After processing all commands, it initializes an empty list `ans` to store the remainders and a variable `p` to 1.

7. It then iterates over the elements of `b` in reverse order. For each element `v`, it calculates the product of `p` and `v` modulo `m` and appends the result to `ans`.

8. Finally, it returns the elements of `ans` in reverse order.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there is a small mistake in the program. The function `func_1` is called with `n, m, a, s` as arguments, but it is defined to take only `n, m, a, s` as arguments. The `*` operator is used to unpack the return value of `func_1` into separate arguments to the `print` function, but this is not necessary. The `print` function can take a single list as an argument and print its elements separated by spaces.

Correctness: **True**
