Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` from the user.
2. The program correctly initializes an empty list `b` to store the rearranged elements of `a` based on the string `s`.
3. The program correctly iterates through the string `s` and rearranges the elements of `a` into the list `b` based on the characters 'L' and 'R'.
4. The program correctly initializes an empty list `ans` to store the cumulative products of the rearranged elements modulo `m`.
5. The program correctly iterates through the list `b` in reverse order, calculates the cumulative product of each element modulo `m`, and appends the result to the list `ans`.
6. The program correctly returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which contains the cumulative products of the rearranged elements modulo `m`.

The execution states of the program provided as comments also confirm that the program is correct. The states show that the program correctly initializes and updates the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `l`, `r`, `i`, `ans`, `p`, and `v` throughout the execution of the program.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, I conclude that the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
