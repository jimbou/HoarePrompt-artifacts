To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how the variables in it change.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. This means the only variable we can adjust is `i`, as it is the loop variable, and `n`, as it is the range limit.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 (as specified in the state for both 'L' and 'R' cases), and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 0, we need to increment it to 1 for the loop to execute again. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not changed by the loop iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of `n` characters consisting of 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing either the first or last element of `a` (depending on the character at index 1 in string `s`), `l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `i` is 1.**
