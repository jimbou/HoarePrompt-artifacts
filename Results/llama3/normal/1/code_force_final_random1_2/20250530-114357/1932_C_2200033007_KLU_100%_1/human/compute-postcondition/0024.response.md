Output State: **The program returns the list of values of p * v % m for all elements v in the original list b in reverse order.**

Here, `p` is the value of `p * v % m` for the last element `v` in the original list `b`, and `v` is the last element of the original list `b`. The list `b` is empty in the initial state, so the list `ans` is also empty. Therefore, the program returns an empty list in reverse order, which is still an empty list.
