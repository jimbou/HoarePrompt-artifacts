#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters consisting of 'L' and 'R'.

    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters consisting of 'L' and 'R', b is an empty list, l is n, r is -1, i is n, ans is a list containing the values of p * v % m for all elements v in the original list b in reverse order, p is the value of p * v % m for the last element v in the original list b, v is the last element of the original list b.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list of values of p * v % m for all elements v in the original list b in reverse order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of positive integers and a string of 'L' and 'R' characters as input, rearranges the integers based on the string, calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged integers modulo a given positive integer, and returns the cumulative products in reverse order.
