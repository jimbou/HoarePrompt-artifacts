Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters consisting of 'L' and 'R', b is a list of n positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, l is n, r is -1, i is n, ans is a list containing the value of p * v % m and the new value of p * v % m, p is the value of p * v % m, v is the second element of b.**

In this output state, the values of n, m, a, s, b, l, r, i remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The value of p has been updated to be the result of p * v % m, where v is the second element of b. The list ans now contains two elements: the original value of p * v % m and the new value of p * v % m.
