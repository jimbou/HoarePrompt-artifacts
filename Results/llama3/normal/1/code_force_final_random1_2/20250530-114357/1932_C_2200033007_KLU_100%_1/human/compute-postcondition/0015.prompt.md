Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters consisting of 'L' and 'R', b is an empty list, l is 0, r is n - 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == 'L':
        b.append(a[l])
        l += 1
    else:
        b.append(a[r])
        r -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer greater than 0, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters consisting of 'L' and 'R'. If the character at index i in string s is 'L', then b is a list containing the first element of a, l is 1, r is n - 1, and i is 0. If the character at index i in string s is 'R', then b is a list containing the last element of a, l is 0, r is n - 2, and i is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of `n` characters consisting of 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing either the first or last element of `a` (depending on the character at index 1 in string `s`) and either the second or first element of `a`, `l` is either 2 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`. If `s[i]` is 'R', `b` is a list containing either the first or last element of `a` (depending on the character at index 1 in string `s`) and the element at index `r+1` in `a`, `l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`. In both cases, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of `n` characters consisting of 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing either the first or last element of `a` (depending on the character at index 1 in string `s`), either the second or first element of `a`, and the element at index `l` in `a`, `l` is either 3 or 2, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is 'R', `b` is a list containing either the first or last element of `a` (depending on the character at index 1 in string `s`), either the second or first element of `a`, and the element at index `r+1` in `a`, `l` is either 2 or 1, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
