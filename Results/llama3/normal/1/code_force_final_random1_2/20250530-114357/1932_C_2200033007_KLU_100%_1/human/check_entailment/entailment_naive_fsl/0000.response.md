Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the problem description. It processes the commands in the order they are written in the string s, and for each command, it calculates the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m. The program then removes the leftmost or rightmost element from the array a based on the command.

The program uses a clever approach by first storing the elements to be removed in the list b, and then calculating the product of the remaining elements in reverse order. This approach ensures that the product is calculated correctly, even when the array a is modified.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the examples provided, and it produces the correct output in all cases. I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
