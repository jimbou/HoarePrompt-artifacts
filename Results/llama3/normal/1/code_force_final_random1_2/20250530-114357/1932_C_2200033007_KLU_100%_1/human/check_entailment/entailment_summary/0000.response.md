Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` first rearranges the elements of the array `a` based on the commands in the string `s`, then calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged elements modulo `m`, and finally returns the cumulative products in reverse order.

The program uses a two-pointer technique to rearrange the elements of the array `a` based on the commands in the string `s`. It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to keep track of the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a` respectively. If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element to the list `b` and increments `l`. If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element to the list `b` and decrements `r`.

After rearranging the elements, the program calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged elements modulo `m` using a loop. It initializes a variable `p` to 1 and then iterates over the rearranged elements in reverse order. For each element, it multiplies `p` by the element modulo `m` and appends the result to the list `ans`.

Finally, the program returns the list `ans` in reverse order using the `reversed` function.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program.

Correctness: **True**
