Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `s` is a string of `n` characters consisting of 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing either the first or last element of `a` (depending on the character at index 1 in string `s`) and either the second or first element of `a`, `l` is either 2 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`. If `s[i]` is 'R', `b` is a list containing either the first or last element of `a` (depending on the character at index 1 in string `s`) and the element at index `r+1` in `a`, `l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`. In both cases, `i` is 1.***
