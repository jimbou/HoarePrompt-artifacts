To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `lk`, and `l`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `lk` is less than `l`. Since `i` is initialized to `lk-2`, we need to adjust its value to `lk` for the loop to start.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n and k is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in b, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk, `i` is lk, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, `lk` is less than `l`**
