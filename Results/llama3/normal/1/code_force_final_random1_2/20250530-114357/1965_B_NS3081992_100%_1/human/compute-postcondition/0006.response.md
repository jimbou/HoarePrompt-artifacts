Output State: **The string returned by `func_14()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character, func_10() returns a non-negative integer, func_14() returns a string, _ is func_10() - 1**

This output state means that the loop has executed `func_10()` number of times, printing the string returned by `func_14()` to the console followed by a newline character each time. The variable `_` has been incremented to `func_10() - 1` after the last iteration. The functions `func_10()` and `func_14()` still return a non-negative integer and a string, respectively, as specified in the initial state.
