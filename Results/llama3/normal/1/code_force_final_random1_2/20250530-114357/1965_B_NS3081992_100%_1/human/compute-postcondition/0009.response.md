To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `lk`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `lk - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `lk` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `lk` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, the condition `i < lk - 1` is still true if `lk` is at least 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n and k is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in b, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, `ans` is a list containing the value 1, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk and is at least 3, `i` is 1**
