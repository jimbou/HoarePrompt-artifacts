The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` writes the string returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character to the console. Since the string returned by `func_14()` is already printed to the console followed by a newline character in the initial state, this code does not change the output of the program. However, it does change the internal state of the program by writing to the console again.

Output State: **The string returned by `func_14()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character again, func_10() returns at least 2, func_14() returns a string, _ is 1**
