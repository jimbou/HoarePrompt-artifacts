Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a list by repeating the result of func_7() a specified number of times, equal to the input parameter rows, and returns this list. The input parameter rows is expected to be a non-negative integer.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a string.
    return input()
    #The program returns the string that was provided as input from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or transformations, effectively echoing the input string.

#Function 12:

    #The program returns the minimum of its original value and the results of func_12(d, processing, di, rank) for all di in d[da] where processing[di - 1] is 0, plus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a rank value based on the input dictionary `d`, list `processing`, key `da`, and list `rank`. If the list associated with key `da` in dictionary `d` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, checks the `processing` list, and recursively calls `func_12` to find the minimum value. The function then updates the `rank` list with the calculated value plus 1 and returns this value.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, where a is greater than or equal to b. It returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a), indicating that the GCD is a and the coefficients are 1 and 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns the calculated coefficients and GCD.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function generates a list of numbers based on the binary representation of the input number `n` and the value of `k`. If `k` is 1, it returns a string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` containing powers of 2 and some additional values based on `k` and `n`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function prints a string returned by `func_14()` to the console a number of times equal to the non-negative integer returned by `func_10()`, appending a newline character after each string.
