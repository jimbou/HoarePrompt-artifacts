This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, where a is greater than or equal to b. It returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a), indicating that the GCD is a and the coefficients are 1 and 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns the calculated coefficients and GCD.
