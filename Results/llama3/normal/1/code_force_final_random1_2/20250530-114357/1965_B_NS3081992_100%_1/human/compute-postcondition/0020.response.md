Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n and k is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in b, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk, `i` is lk + 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk-1), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^(lk+1), 2^(lk+2), 2^(lk+2), `lk` is less than `l` and `l` is greater than `lk + 2**

The value of `ans` has been updated by appending the value of 2 raised to the power of `i`, which is `2^(lk+2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
