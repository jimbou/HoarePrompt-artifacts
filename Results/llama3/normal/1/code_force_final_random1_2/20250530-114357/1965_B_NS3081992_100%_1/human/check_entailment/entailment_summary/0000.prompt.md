Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function generates a list of a specified number of elements, where each element is the result of calling another function named 'func_3()'. The length of the list is determined by the input 'rows_number', which is a positive integer. The function returns this list, with the exact values of its elements depending on the outcome of 'func_3()'.

 Output hints for function5:  Reads the next line from the standard input file and returns it as a bytes object with trailing newlines and carriage returns removed.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  Reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin), removes trailing characters, and decodes it to a string using a specified encoding, returning the resulting string.
Function number 7 :

Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():

''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function reads a string from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or transformations, effectively echoing the input string.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function reads an integer from standard input and returns it without modification.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function reads a string of two space-separated integers from standard input, splits the string into two substrings at the space separator, and returns the substrings as a list of two strings, each representing an integer.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9

            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  This function calculates and returns a rank value based on the input dictionary `d`, list `processing`, key `da`, and list `rank`. If the list associated with key `da` in dictionary `d` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, checks the `processing` list, and recursively calls `func_12` to find the minimum value. The function then updates the `rank` list with the calculated value plus 1 and returns this value.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1

    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b, where a is greater than or equal to b. It returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a), indicating that the GCD is a and the coefficients are 1 and 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns the calculated coefficients and GCD.
Function number 14 :

    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)

            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  Functionality: This function generates a list of numbers based on the binary representation of the input number `n` and the value of `k`. If `k` is 1, it returns a string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` containing powers of 2 and some additional values based on `k` and `n`. The function then returns a string containing the length of `ans` and its elements. The returned string is in the format of the length of `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():

        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function prints a string returned by `func_14()` to the console a number of times equal to the non-negative integer returned by `func_10()`, appending a newline character after each string.
