To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `lk`, and `l`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `l`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `lk`, and `lk` is less than `l`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n and k is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in b, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk, `i` is lk + 1, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk-1), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, `lk` is less than `l`**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `i`, as it is the only variable in the loop head that needs to be updated for the loop to execute again.
