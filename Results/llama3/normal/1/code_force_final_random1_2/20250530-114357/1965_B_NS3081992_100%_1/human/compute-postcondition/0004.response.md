According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `func_10()`. If `_` is less than `func_10()`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `func_10()` returns at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 2, and `func_10()` must return at least 3 for the loop to execute again.
State: **The string returned by `func_14()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character again, func_10() returns at least 3, func_14() returns a string, _ is 2**
