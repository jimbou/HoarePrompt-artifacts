The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and func_10, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the func_10.  If the func_10 returns at least 2 the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, func_10 returns at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the func_10 must return at least 2 and the variable _ is 1.
State: **func_10() returns at least 2, func_14() returns a string, the string returned by func_14() is printed to the console followed by a newline character, _ is 1**
