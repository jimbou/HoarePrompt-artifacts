Output State: **The string returned by `func_14()` is printed to the console followed by a newline character, func_10() returns at least 3, func_14() returns a string, _ is 2**

The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` prints the string returned by `func_14()` to the console followed by a newline character. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the string returned by `func_14()` has been printed to the console.
