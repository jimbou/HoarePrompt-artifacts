Postcondition: **n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b. If k is 1, then n and k are integers such that 3 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. Otherwise, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n and k is not equal to 1, b is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, l is an integer equal to the number of digits in b, bk is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, lk is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk, i is l, ans is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk-1), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^(lk+1), 2^(lk+2), ..., 2^(l-1), lk is less than l and l is greater than lk + 2.**
