Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n and k is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in b, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk, `i` is lk-2**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ans` contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), where lk is the number of digits in the binary representation of k. The other variables remain unchanged.
