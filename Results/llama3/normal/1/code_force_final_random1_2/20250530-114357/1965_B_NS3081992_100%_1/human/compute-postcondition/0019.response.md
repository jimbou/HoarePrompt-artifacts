The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, lk and l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `lk` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `lk + 1`, `lk` is less than `l`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be `lk + 2` and `lk` must be less than `l` and `l` must be greater than `lk + 2`. Also `ans` must be updated to include the value of 2^(lk+1).
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n and k is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in b, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk, `i` is lk + 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk-1), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^(lk+1), 2^(lk+2), `lk` is less than `l` and `l` is greater than `lk + 2`**
