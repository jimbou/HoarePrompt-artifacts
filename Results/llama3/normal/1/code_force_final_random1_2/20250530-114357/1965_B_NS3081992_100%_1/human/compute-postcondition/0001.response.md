Output State: **func_10() returns at least 1, func_14() returns a string, the string returned by func_14() is printed to the console followed by a newline character.**

In this output state, the values of func_10() and func_14() remain unchanged, as they are functions and their return values are not affected by the code. However, the string returned by func_14() is now printed to the console, followed by a newline character, as a result of the sys.stdout.write() function call.
