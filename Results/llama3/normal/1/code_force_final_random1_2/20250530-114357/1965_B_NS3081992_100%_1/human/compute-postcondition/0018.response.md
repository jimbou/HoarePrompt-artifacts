Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n and k is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in b, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk, `i` is lk + 1, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk-1), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^(lk+1), `lk` is less than `l`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is 2 raised to the power of `i` (where `i` is `lk + 1`). All other variables remain unchanged.
