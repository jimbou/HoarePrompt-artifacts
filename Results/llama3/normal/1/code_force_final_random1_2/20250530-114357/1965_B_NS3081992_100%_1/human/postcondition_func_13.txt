Functionality: This function generates a list of numbers based on the binary representation of the input number `n` and the value of `k`. If `k` is 1, it returns a string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` containing powers of 2 and some additional values based on `k` and `n`. The function then returns a string containing the length of `ans` and its elements. The returned string is in the format of the length of `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.
