Output State: **The program returns a string containing the length of list 'ans' and the elements of 'ans'. The length of 'ans' is equal to the number of elements in 'ans'. The elements of 'ans' are the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk-1), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^(lk+1), 2^(lk+2), ..., 2^(l-1). The value of lk is less than l and l is greater than lk + 2. The value of k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n and k is not equal to 1. The value of n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6. The value of l is an integer equal to the number of digits in the binary representation of n.**
