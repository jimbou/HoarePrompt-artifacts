Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n and k is not equal to 1, `b` is a string of binary digits representing the value of n, `l` is an integer equal to the number of digits in b, `bk` is a string of binary digits representing the value of k, `lk` is an integer equal to the number of digits in bk, `i` is `l`, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 2^2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk-1), k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^(lk+1), 2^(lk+2), ..., 2^(l-1), `lk` is less than or equal to `l`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variable `i` has reached the value of `l`, which is the number of digits in the binary representation of `n`. The list `ans` now contains all the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), and the other variables remain unchanged.
