This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a polygon with n sides, x chosen vertices, and a maximum of y additional vertices that can be chosen. It calculates the maximum number of vertices that can be chosen, considering the constraints of the polygon and the chosen vertices. The function then prints the maximum number of vertices that can be chosen for each test case.
