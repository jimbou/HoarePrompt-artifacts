Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, `st` is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1`, otherwise it is equal to `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is an integer equal to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `odd` is a list that contains the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and `gap` is odd, and `even` is a list of integers that includes the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and `gap` is even.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `odd` now contains the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and `gap` is odd. The other variables remain unchanged.
