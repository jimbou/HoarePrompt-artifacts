Postcondition: ***`ans` is an integer equal to `x` if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `x` - number of iterations where `t1` is in `st` or `t2` is not in `st`. If `y` is less than half of `gap`, then `ans` is increased by 2 times the original value of `y` and `y` is set to 0. `i` is `x` - 1, `t1` is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `odd` is a sorted list containing at least one value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and is an odd number, `even` is a sorted list containing all the values of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and is even, otherwise `even` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `st` is a set of integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains no input, `gap` is the first element of the list `odd`, and the current value of `gap`, which is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, is either greater than 1 and is an odd number or is less than or equal to 1 or is even.***
