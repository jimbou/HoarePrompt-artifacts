Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans is an integer equal to x if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - number of iterations where t1 is in st or t2 is not in st, y is its original value minus the sum of all elements in the even list divided by 2, i is x - 1, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n, odd is a sorted list containing all the values of gap if gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, otherwise odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing all the values of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, otherwise even is an empty list, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, t must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input, and the current value of gap, which is next_elem - a[i] - 1, is either greater than 1 and is an odd number or is less than or equal to 1 or is even.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus gap, y is an integer equal to its original value minus half of gap, i is x - 1, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n, odd is a sorted list containing at least one value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, even is a sorted list containing all the values of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, otherwise even is an empty list, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, t must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input, gap is the first element of the list odd, and the current value of gap, which is next_elem - a[i] - 1, is either greater than 1 and is an odd number or is less than or equal to 1 or is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times the new gap if y is less than half of the new gap, otherwise ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times the new gap, y is an integer equal to its original value minus the new gap if y is greater than or equal to the new gap, otherwise y is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n, odd is a sorted list containing at least one value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, even is a sorted list containing all the values of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, otherwise even is an empty list, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, t must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input, and gap is the next element in the list odd which is either greater than 1 and is an odd number or does not exist if odd has been exhausted.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times y, y is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n, odd is a sorted list containing at least two values of gap if gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, even is a sorted list containing all the values of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, otherwise even is an empty list, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, t must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input, and gap is the next element in the list odd which is either greater than 1 and is an odd number or does not exist if odd has been exhausted.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
