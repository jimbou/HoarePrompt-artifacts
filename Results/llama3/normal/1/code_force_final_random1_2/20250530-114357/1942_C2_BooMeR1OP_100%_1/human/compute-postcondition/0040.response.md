Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, odd is a sorted list that contains the value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and gap is odd, even is a sorted list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is even, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop, or ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop.**
