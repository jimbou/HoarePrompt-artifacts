Output State: **`ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list `odd`, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `x` is greater than 2, `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. `even` is a list of integers including the current value of `gap` and the previous values of `gap` that are even numbers, and `odd` is a list of integers including the previous values of `gap` that are odd numbers.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` remains the same as it was not affected by the code. The values of `i`, `t1`, `t2`, `x`, `next_elem`, and `gap` also remain unchanged. The only change is in the list `even`, which now includes the current value of `gap` and the previous values of `gap` that are even numbers. The list `odd` remains the same, containing the previous values of `gap` that are odd numbers.
