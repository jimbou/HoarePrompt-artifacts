Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, ans is an integer equal to x - 2, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
    t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
    if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 0, y is an integer, if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, then ans is an integer equal to x - 1. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to x - 2, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is 0, t1 is an integer equal to (a[0] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[0] + 2) % n.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, `st` is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[1] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 2, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is 2, t1 is an integer equal to (a[2] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[2] + 2) % n. If t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, then ans is an integer equal to x + 1. Otherwise, ans remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
