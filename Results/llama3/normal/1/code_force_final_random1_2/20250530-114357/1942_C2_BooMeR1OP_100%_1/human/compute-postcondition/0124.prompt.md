Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the sorted list odd, i is x, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1], and gap is next_elem - a[i] - 1. If gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, then odd is a sorted list containing the current value of gap and the previous values of gap that are odd numbers, and even is a list of integers including the previous values of gap that are even numbers. If gap is greater than 0 and is even, then even is a sorted list of integers including the current value of gap and the previous values of gap that are even numbers, and odd is a list of integers including the previous values of gap that are odd numbers. Otherwise, odd and even are lists of integers including the previous values of gap that are odd and even numbers respectively.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times y if y is less than half of the first element of the sorted list odd, otherwise it remains unchanged plus gap, y is -gap // 2, i is x, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i equals x - 1 else a[i + 1], gap is the first element of the sorted list odd, odd is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and even is a list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times y if y is less than half of the second element of the sorted list odd, otherwise it remains unchanged plus the second element of the sorted list odd, plus gap, y is 0 if y is less than half of the second element of the sorted list odd, otherwise y remains -the second element of the sorted list odd // 2, minus gap // 2, i is x, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i equals x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, and even is a list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times y if y is less than half of the third element of the sorted list odd, otherwise it remains unchanged plus the third element of the sorted list odd, plus 2 times gap, y is 0 if y is less than half of the third element of the sorted list odd, otherwise y remains -the third element of the sorted list odd // 2, minus gap, i is x, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i equals x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, and even is a list of integers, gap is the second element of the sorted list odd.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
