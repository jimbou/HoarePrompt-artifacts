Postcondition: ***`ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list `odd`, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `x` is greater than 2, `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and is even, then `even` is a list of integers including the current value of `gap` and the previous values of `gap` that are even numbers, and `odd` is a list of integers including the previous values of `gap` that are odd numbers. Otherwise, `odd` and `even` are lists of integers including the previous values of `gap` that are odd and even numbers respectively.***
