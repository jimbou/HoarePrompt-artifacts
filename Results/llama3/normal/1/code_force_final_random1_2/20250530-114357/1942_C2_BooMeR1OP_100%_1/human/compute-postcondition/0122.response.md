Postcondition: ***ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times y if y is less than half of the third element of the sorted list odd, otherwise it remains unchanged plus the third element of the sorted list odd, plus gap, y is 0 if y is less than half of the third element of the sorted list odd, otherwise y remains -the third element of the sorted list odd // 2, minus gap // 2, i is x, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i equals x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, and even is a list of integers, gap is the second element of the sorted list odd.***
