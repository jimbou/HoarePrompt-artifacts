Postcondition: ***`ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the sorted list `odd` plus `gap` plus 2 times the value of `y` if `y` is less than half of the original `gap`, otherwise `ans` remains the same as its original value plus the sum of all elements in the sorted list `odd` plus `gap`. `y` is 0 if `y` is less than half of the original `gap`, otherwise `y` is its original value minus `gap // 2`. `i` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, and `gap` is the third element of the `even` list.***
