Postcondition: **`ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus the new gap plus 2 times its original value minus half of the new gap if `y` is less than half of the new gap, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus the new gap, `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the new gap if `y` is greater than or equal to half of the new gap, otherwise `y` is 0, `i` is `x` - 1, `t1` is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `odd` is a sorted list containing at least one value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, `even` is a sorted list containing all the values of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, otherwise `even` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `st` is a set of integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains no input, and `gap` is the next element in the list `odd` which is either greater than 1 and is an odd number or does not exist if `odd` has been exhausted.**
