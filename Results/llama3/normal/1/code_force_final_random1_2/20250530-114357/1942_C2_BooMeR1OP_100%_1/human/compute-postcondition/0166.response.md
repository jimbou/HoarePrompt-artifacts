Postcondition: **ans is an integer equal to x if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - number of iterations where t1 is in st or t2 is not in st, y is its original value minus the sum of all elements in the even list divided by 2, i is 0, t1 is (a[0] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[0] + 2) % n, x is greater than 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is a list containing the current value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, otherwise odd is an empty list, even is a list containing one element which is the current value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, otherwise even is an empty list, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, t must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input, and the current value of gap, which is next_elem - a[i] - 1, is either greater than 1 and is an odd number or is less than or equal to 1 or is even.**
