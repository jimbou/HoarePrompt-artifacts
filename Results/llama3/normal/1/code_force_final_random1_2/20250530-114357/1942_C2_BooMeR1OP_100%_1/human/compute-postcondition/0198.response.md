Postcondition: **`ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the odd list if `y` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of all elements in the odd list, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times `y` if `y` is greater than or equal to half of the gap, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times `y`. `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the sum of all elements in the odd list if `y` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of all elements in the odd list, otherwise `y` is 0 if `y` is less than half of the gap, otherwise `y` is its original value minus half of the sum of all elements in the odd list. `i` is `x` - 1, `t1` is (`a[x - 1]` + 1) % `n`, `t2` is (`a[x - 1]` + 2) % `n`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `next_elem` is `a[0]` + `n`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is a sorted list containing at least 1 value of `gap`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `st` is a set of integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains no input, `gap` is the first element in the list `even`, and `gap` is greater than 0 and is even.**
