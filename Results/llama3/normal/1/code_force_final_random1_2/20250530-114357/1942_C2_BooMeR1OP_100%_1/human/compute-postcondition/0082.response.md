The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unknown, `x` is unknown. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is i+1 and for the loop to execute again x must be greater than i+1.
State: **`ans` is an integer equal to -1 plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list `odd`, if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`. Otherwise, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is an integer equal to -2 plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list `odd`, i is i+1, x is greater than i+1**
