Output State: **ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the sorted list `odd` plus `gap` plus 2 times the value of `y`, y is 0, i is `x`, t1 is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, t2 is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, odd is an empty list, even is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, and gap is the third element of the `even` list.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by twice the value of `y`, which was originally `-gap // 2` if the original value of `y` was less than half of the original `gap`, otherwise `y` was its original value minus `gap // 2`. The value of `y` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
