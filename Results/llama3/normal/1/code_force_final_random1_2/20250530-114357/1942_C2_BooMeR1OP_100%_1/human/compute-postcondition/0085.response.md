Postcondition: ***ans is an integer equal to -1 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st. Otherwise, the program prints the value of ans, which is an integer equal to -2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, i is i+1, x is greater than i+1, t1 is (a[i] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[i] + 2) % n. If t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, ans is increased by 1.***
