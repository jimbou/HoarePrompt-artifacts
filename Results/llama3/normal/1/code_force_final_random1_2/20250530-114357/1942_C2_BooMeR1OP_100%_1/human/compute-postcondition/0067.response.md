Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, even is a sorted list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is even and is not empty and gap is removed from the list, odd is a list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is odd, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, or ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, if y is less than gap divided by 2, then y is 0, otherwise y is either a negative integer equal to y - gap // 2 or 0, and gap is the next element in the list even, ans is incremented by gap, and y is decremented by gap // 2.**
