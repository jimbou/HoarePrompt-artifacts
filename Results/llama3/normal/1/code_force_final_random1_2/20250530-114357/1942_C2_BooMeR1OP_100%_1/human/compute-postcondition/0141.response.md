State: **ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the sorted list odd plus the sum of all elements in the even list, y is its original value minus the sum of all elements in the even list divided by 2, i is x, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i equals x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is an empty list, and even is an empty list, and the value of ans is being printed, t must be greater than 0**
