State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, even is a sorted list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is even and is not empty and gap is removed from the list, odd is an empty list, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, or ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, y is a negative integer equal to y - gap // 2, gap is the second element in even if even has at least 2 elements, otherwise gap is not defined**
