The only variable in the loop head is gap and list odd, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the odd list. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, odd has at least 2 elements, gap is the first element of the list odd. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the gap is the second element of the list odd.
State: **ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times y if y is less than half of the third element of the sorted list odd, otherwise it remains unchanged plus the third element of the sorted list odd, plus gap, y is 0 if y is less than half of the third element of the sorted list odd, otherwise y remains -the third element of the sorted list odd // 2, minus gap // 2, i is x, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i equals x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, and even is a list of integers, gap is the second element of the sorted list odd**
