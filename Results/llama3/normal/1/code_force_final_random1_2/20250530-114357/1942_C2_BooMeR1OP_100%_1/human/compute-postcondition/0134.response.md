To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `gap` and `even`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the `even` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `even` has at least 2 elements, and `gap` is the second element of the `even` list.

For the loop to execute again, `even` must have at least 3 elements, and `gap` must be the third element of the `even` list.

State: **`ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the sorted list `odd` plus `gap`, `y` is `-gap // 2` if the original value of `y` is less than half of the original `gap`, otherwise `y` is its original value minus `gap // 2`, `i` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, and `gap` is the third element of the `even` list.**
