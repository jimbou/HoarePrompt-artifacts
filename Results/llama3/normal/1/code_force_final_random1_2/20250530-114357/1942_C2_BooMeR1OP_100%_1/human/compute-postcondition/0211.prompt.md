Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is the number of sides of the polygon, x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and y is the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The constraints are 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 <= y <= n - x.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    ans = x - 2
    st = set(a)
    a.sort()
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
            ans += 1
    odd = []
    even = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
            odd.append(gap)
        elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
            even.append(gap)
    odd.sort()
    even.sort()
    for gap in odd:
        if y < gap // 2:
            ans += 2 * y
            y = 0
            break
        ans += gap
        y -= gap // 2
    for gap in even:
        if y < gap // 2:
            ans += 2 * y
            y = 0
            break
        ans += gap
        y -= gap // 2
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, even is an empty list, odd is a list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is odd, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, or ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, y is 0, and the value of ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the sorted list odd plus the sum of all elements in the even list, y is its original value minus the sum of all elements in the even list divided by 2, i is x, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i equals x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is an empty list, and even is an empty list, and the value of ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the even list, y is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n, odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, t must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input, and gap does not exist because even has been exhausted, and the value of ans which is the original value of ans plus the sum of all elements in the even list is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
