Output State: **`ans` is an integer equal to `x - 1`, `y` is its original value minus the sum of all elements in the `even` list divided by 2, `i` is 0, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `st` is a set of integers, `t` must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input, the current value of `t1` is not in `st` and the current value of `t2` is in `st`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to `x - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `y` still being its original value minus the sum of all elements in the `even` list divided by 2, `i` remaining 0, `t1` and `t2` still being `(a[i] + 1) % n` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` respectively, `x` still greater than 0, `next_elem` still `a[i + 1]`, `odd` and `even` still empty lists, `n` still an integer, `a` still a sorted list of integers, `st` still a set of integers, and `t` still greater than 0. The stdin still contains no input, and the current values of `t1` and `t2` are still not in `st` and in `st` respectively.
