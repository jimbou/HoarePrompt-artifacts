Postcondition: ***`ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times `y` if `y` is less than half of the first element of the sorted list `odd`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `y` is 0, `i` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is the first element of the sorted list `odd`, `odd` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `even` is a list of integers.***
