Output State: **ans is an integer equal to x - 2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, i is 0, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, x is greater than 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1], gap is next_elem - a[i] - 1**
