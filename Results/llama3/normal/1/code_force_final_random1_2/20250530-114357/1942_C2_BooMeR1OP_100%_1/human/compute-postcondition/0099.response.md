Output State: **`ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list `odd`, `i` is 1, `t1` is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `x` is greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i == x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `odd` is a list containing the current value of `gap` and the previous values of `gap` that are odd numbers, and `even` is a list of integers including the previous values of `gap` that are even numbers.**

In this output state, the value of `odd` has been updated to include the current value of `gap`, which is an odd number. The other variables remain unchanged.
