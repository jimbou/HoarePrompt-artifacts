Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is the last element in the list odd, odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is even, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, or ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, y is 0.
Code of the loop:
for gap in even:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is the first element in even, odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is even and is not empty, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, or ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, y is a negative integer equal to y - gap // 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, even is a sorted list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is even and is not empty and gap is removed from the list, odd is a list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is odd, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, or ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, y is either a negative integer equal to y - gap // 2 or 0, gap is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, even is a sorted list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is even and is not empty and gap is removed from the list, odd is a list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is odd, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, or ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, if y is less than gap divided by 2, then y is 0, otherwise y is either a negative integer equal to y - gap // 2 or 0, and gap is the next element in the list even, ans is incremented by gap, and y is decremented by gap // 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
