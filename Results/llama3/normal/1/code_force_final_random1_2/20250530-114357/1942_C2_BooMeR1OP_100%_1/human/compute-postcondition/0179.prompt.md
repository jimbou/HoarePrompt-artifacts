Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans is an integer equal to x if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - number of iterations where t1 is in st or t2 is not in st. y is its original value minus the sum of all elements in the even list divided by 2. i is x - 1, t1 is (a[i] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[i] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i equals x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, t must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
        odd.append(gap)
    elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
        even.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ans is an integer equal to x if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - number of iterations where t1 is in st or t2 is not in st, y is its original value minus the sum of all elements in the even list divided by 2, i is 0, t1 is (a[0] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[0] + 2) % n, x is greater than 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is a list containing the current value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, otherwise odd is an empty list, even is a list containing one element which is the current value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, otherwise even is an empty list, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, t must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input, and the current value of gap, which is next_elem - a[i] - 1, is either greater than 1 and is an odd number or is less than or equal to 1 or is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *ans is an integer equal to x if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - number of iterations where t1 is in st or t2 is not in st, y is its original value minus the sum of all elements in the even list divided by 2, i is 1, t1 is (a[1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[1] + 2) % n, x is greater than 1, next_elem is a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is a list containing the current value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, otherwise odd is an empty list, even is a list containing one element which is the current value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, otherwise even is a list containing two elements which are the current value of gap and the previous value of gap, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, t must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input, and the current value of gap, which is next_elem - a[i] - 1, is either greater than 1 and is an odd number or is less than or equal to 1 or is even. If gap is even, the even list contains two elements: the current value of gap and the previous value of gap.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *ans is an integer equal to x if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - number of iterations where t1 is in st or t2 is not in st, y is its original value minus the sum of all elements in the even list divided by 2, i is 2, t1 is (a[2] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[2] + 2) % n, x is greater than 2, next_elem is a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is a list containing the current value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and is an odd number, otherwise odd is an empty list, even is a list containing one element which is the current value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, otherwise even is a list containing two elements which are the current value of gap and the previous value of gap, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, t must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input, and the current value of gap, which is next_elem - a[i] - 1, is either greater than 1 and is an odd number or is less than or equal to 1 or is even. If gap is even, the even list contains two elements: the current value of gap and the previous value of gap. If gap is even, the even list has been appended with the current value of gap.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
