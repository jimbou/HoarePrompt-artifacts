Postcondition: ***ans is an integer equal to x - 2 if t1 is in st or t2 is not in st, otherwise ans is an integer equal to x - 1. y is its original value minus the sum of all elements in the even list divided by 2. i is 0, t1 is (a[i] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[i] + 2) % n, x is greater than 0, next_elem is a[i + 1], odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, t must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input.***
