Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is the number of sides of the polygon, x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and y is the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The constraints are 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 <= y <= n - x.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines with the specified constraints. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain as specified in the initial state.
