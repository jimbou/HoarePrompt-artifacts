Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1, odd is a sorted list that contains the value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and gap is odd, even is a sorted list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is even, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop, or ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is the first element in the list odd, odd is a sorted list that contains at least 1 element and contains the value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and gap is odd, even is a sorted list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is even, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus gap, or ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus gap, y is either 0 if y is less than gap divided by 2, otherwise y is y minus gap divided by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is the second element in the list odd, odd is a sorted list that contains at least 2 elements and contains the value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and gap is odd, even is a sorted list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is even, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus gap, or ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus gap, y is either 0 if y is less than gap divided by 2, otherwise y is y minus gap divided by 2. If y is less than gap divided by 2, then y is 0, ans is increased by gap, y is decreased by gap divided by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, gap is the third element in the list odd, odd is a sorted list that contains at least 3 elements and contains the value of gap if gap is greater than 1 and gap is odd, even is a sorted list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is even, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus gap plus gap, or ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus gap plus gap, y is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
