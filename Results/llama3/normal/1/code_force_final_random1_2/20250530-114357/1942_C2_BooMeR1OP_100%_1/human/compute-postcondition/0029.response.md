Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, `st` is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1`, otherwise it is equal to `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is an integer equal to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `odd` is a list that contains the value of `gap`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `_`, `n`, `y`, `a`, `st`, `stdin`, `i`, `x`, `t1`, `t2`, `next_elem`, and `gap` remains the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the list `odd` now contains the value of `gap`, which is the difference between the next element in the sorted list `a` and the current element `a[i]`, minus 1.
