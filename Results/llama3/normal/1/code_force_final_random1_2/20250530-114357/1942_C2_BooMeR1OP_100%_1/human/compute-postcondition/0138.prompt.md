Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the sorted list odd, y is 0, i is x, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i equals x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is an empty list, and even is a list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for gap in even:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the sorted list odd plus 2 times the original value of y if y is less than half of gap, otherwise ans remains the same as its original value plus the sum of all elements in the sorted list odd, y is -gap // 2, i is x, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i equals x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is an empty list, even is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and gap is the first element of the even list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the sorted list odd plus gap, y is -gap // 2 if the original value of y is less than half of the original gap, otherwise y is its original value minus gap // 2, i is x, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n if i equals x - 1 else a[i + 1], odd is an empty list, even is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, and gap is the second element of the even list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the sorted list `odd` plus 2 times the value of `gap`, `y` is its original value minus `gap // 2`, `i` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, and `gap` is the third element of the `even` list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
