Postcondition: **The program prints the value of `ans`, which is an integer equal to -1 plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list `odd`, if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`. Otherwise, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is an integer equal to -2 plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list `odd`.**
