Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, even is an empty list, odd is a list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is odd, ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, y is 0, and the value of ans is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
    t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
    if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is 0, t1 is an integer equal to (a[0] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[0] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n, even is an empty list, odd is a list of integers that includes the value of gap if gap is greater than 0 and gap is odd, if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, ans is an integer equal to -1 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, otherwise ans is an integer equal to -2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, y is 0, x is at least 1, and the value of ans is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program prints the value of `ans`, which is an integer equal to -1 plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list `odd`, if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`. Otherwise, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is an integer equal to -2 plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list `odd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *ans is an integer equal to -1 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, if t1 is not in st and t2 is in st. Otherwise, the program prints the value of ans, which is an integer equal to -2 plus the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the list odd, i is i+1, x is greater than i+1, t1 is (a[i] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[i] + 2) % n. If t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, ans is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
