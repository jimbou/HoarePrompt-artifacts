Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the odd list if y is greater than or equal to half of the sum of all elements in the odd list, otherwise ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times y, y is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the sum of all elements in the odd list if y is greater than or equal to half of the sum of all elements in the odd list, otherwise y is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n, odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing all the values of gap if gap is greater than 0 and is even, otherwise even is an empty list, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, t must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input, and gap does not exist because odd has been exhausted.
Code of the loop:
for gap in even:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the odd list if `y` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of all elements in the odd list, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times `y` if `y` is greater than or equal to half of the gap, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times `y`. `y` is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the sum of all elements in the odd list if `y` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of all elements in the odd list, otherwise `y` is 0 if `y` is less than half of the gap, otherwise `y` is its original value minus half of the sum of all elements in the odd list. `i` is `x` - 1, `t1` is (`a[x - 1]` + 1) % `n`, `t2` is (`a[x - 1]` + 2) % `n`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `next_elem` is `a[0]` + `n`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is a sorted list containing at least 1 value of `gap`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `st` is a set of integers, `t` must be greater than 0, `stdin` contains no input, `gap` is the first element in the list `even`, and `gap` is greater than 0 and is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of all elements in the odd list if y is greater than or equal to half of the sum of all elements in the odd list, otherwise ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times y if y is greater than or equal to half of the gap, otherwise ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times y. y is an integer equal to its original value minus half of the sum of all elements in the odd list if y is greater than or equal to half of the sum of all elements in the odd list, otherwise y is 0 if y is less than half of the gap, otherwise y is its original value minus half of the sum of all elements in the odd list. i is x - 1, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n, odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing at least 2 values of gap, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, t must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input, gap is the second element in the list even, and gap is greater than 0 and is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ans is an integer equal to its original value plus 2 times y plus gap, y is 0, i is x - 1, t1 is (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, x is greater than or equal to 0, next_elem is a[0] + n, odd is an empty list, even is a sorted list containing at least 3 values of gap, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, st is a set of integers, t must be greater than 0, stdin contains no input, and gap is the third element in the list even, and gap is greater than 0 and is even.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
