Postcondition: **`ans` is an integer equal to `x` - 2 plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations of the loop plus the sum of all elements in the sorted list `odd`, `i` is `x`, `t1` is (`a[x - 1] + 1`) % `n`, `t2` is (`a[x - 1] + 2`) % `n`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` == `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, and `gap` is the first element of the sorted list `odd` that must have at least 1 element, `odd` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `even` is a list of integers. The current value of `y` is less than half of `gap`.**
