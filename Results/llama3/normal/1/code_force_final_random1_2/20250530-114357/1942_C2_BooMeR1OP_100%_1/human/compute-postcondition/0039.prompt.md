Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is x - 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, odd is an empty list, even is an empty list, ans is an integer equal to x - 1 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop, or ans is an integer equal to x - 2 + the number of times t1 is not in st and t2 is in st for all iterations of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
        odd.append(gap)
    elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
        even.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, `st` is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and is odd, `odd` is a list containing the current value of `gap`, and `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 1 + the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations of the loop`, or `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2 + the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations of the loop`. If `gap` is less than or equal to 1 or `gap` is even, `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 1 + the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations of the loop`, or `ans` is an integer equal to `x - 2 + the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` for all iterations of the loop`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and is even, `even` is a list containing the current value of `gap`. `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1`, otherwise it is equal to `a[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is 1, x is greater than 1, t1 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[x - 1] + 2) % n, next_elem is an integer equal to a[0] + n if i is equal to x - 1, otherwise it is equal to a[i + 1], gap is an integer equal to next_elem - a[i] - 1. If gap is greater than 1 and gap is odd, then odd is a list that contains the value of gap. If gap is greater than 0 and gap is even, then even is a list of integers that includes the value of gap.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, `st` is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is an integer equal to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1`, otherwise it is equal to `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is an integer equal to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and `gap` is odd, then `odd` is a list that contains the value of `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and `gap` is even, then `even` is a list of integers that includes the value of `gap`. Otherwise, no change is made to `even`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
