Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, `st` is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 2, `t1` is an integer equal to `(a[2] + 1) % n`, `t2` is an integer equal to `(a[2] + 2) % n`, if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `x + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, but only if the conditions `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` are met. If these conditions are not met, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their original values and properties.
