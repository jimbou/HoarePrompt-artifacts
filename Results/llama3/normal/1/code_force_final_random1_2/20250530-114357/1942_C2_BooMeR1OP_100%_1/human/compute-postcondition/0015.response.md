Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer greater than 2, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, st is a set of integers where each integer is one less than the corresponding input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is 2, t1 is an integer equal to (a[2] + 1) % n, t2 is an integer equal to (a[2] + 2) % n. If t1 is not in st and t2 is in st, then ans is an integer equal to x + 1. Otherwise, ans remains unchanged.**
