Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, x is an integer equal to the kth element of a. If c is 2 and the current value of a[i] is greater than x, then ind is a list containing one integer i+1, and c is 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and if c is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
