The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `n` is greater than or equal to `i+1`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `i+1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i+1`.
State: **a is a list containing two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, x is an integer equal to the kth element of a. If c is 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the current value of a[i] is greater than x, then ind is a list containing one integer i+1, and i+1 is not 0. Otherwise, ind remains an empty list, and i+1 remains 0. If c is not 2, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
