Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, x is an integer equal to the kth element of a, n is n, c is 3 if a[i] is less than or equal to x, otherwise c is 4, ind is a list containing one integer i+1 if a[i] is less than or equal to x, otherwise ind is a list containing two integers i+1 and n, i is n. If c is equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
