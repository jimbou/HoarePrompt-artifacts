Output State: **The program returns the minimum value between the index of the second element in list 'a' that is greater than 'x' minus 1, and 'k' minus 1, where 'x' is the kth element of list 'a', 'k' is an integer between 1 and 'n' (inclusive), and 'n' is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).**

In this output state, the program returns a value that is either the index of the second element in list 'a' that is greater than 'x' minus 1, or 'k' minus 1, whichever is smaller. The value of 'x' is the kth element of list 'a', and 'k' is an integer between 1 and 'n' (inclusive), where 'n' is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
