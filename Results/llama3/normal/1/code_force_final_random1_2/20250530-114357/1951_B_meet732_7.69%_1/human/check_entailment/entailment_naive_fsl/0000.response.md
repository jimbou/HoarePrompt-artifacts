Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins the cow can achieve. The function `func_1` is trying to find the indices of the two largest numbers in the list, but it does not correctly handle the case when the two largest numbers are on the same side of the cow's index.

For example, if the input is `n = 6, k = 3, a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the program will return `2`, but the correct answer is `3`. The cow can win 3 matches by swapping with the cow at index 4.

The program also does not correctly handle the case when the cow's index is at the boundary of the list. For example, if the input is `n = 6, k = 1, a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the program will return `0`, but the correct answer is `1`. The cow can win 1 match by not swapping with any other cow.

The program needs to be modified to correctly handle these cases and find the maximum number of wins the cow can achieve.
