Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two integers n and k, where n is between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), and k is between 1 and n (inclusive), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, x is an integer equal to the kth element of a, ind is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in a that are greater than x, c is 2, and i is the index of the last element in a that was checked. If k is equal to 14, the indices of the first two elements in a that are greater than x are printed. Additionally, ind is not an empty list and has more than one element. The first element of ind is not 0. k is less than or equal to ind[1].***
