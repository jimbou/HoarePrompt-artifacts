The code prints the list containing the indices of the first two elements in the list `a` that are greater than the 14th element of `a`, which is `x`. The indices are based on the order in which the elements were checked, with the last checked element being at index `i`. The list `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements that meet this condition.

Output: **[index of the first element in a that is greater than x, index of the second element in a that is greater than x]**
