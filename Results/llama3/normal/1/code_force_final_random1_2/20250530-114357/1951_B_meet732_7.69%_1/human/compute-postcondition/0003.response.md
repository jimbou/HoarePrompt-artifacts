Output State: **a is a list containing two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, x is an integer equal to the kth element of a, ind is a list containing one integer i, c is 1, i is 0, n is greater than 0, and the current value of a[i] is greater than x.**

In this output state, the list `ind` now contains the index `i` because the first line of the code appended `i` to `ind`. The variable `c` has been incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged: `a` is still a list containing two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `x` is still equal to the `k`th element of `a`, `i` is still 0, and `n` is still greater than 0. Additionally, the current value of `a[i]` is still greater than `x`.
