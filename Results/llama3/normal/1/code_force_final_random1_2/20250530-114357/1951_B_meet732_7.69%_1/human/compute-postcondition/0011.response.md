Output State: **a is a list containing two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, x is an integer equal to the kth element of a. If the current value of a[i] is greater than x, then ind is a list containing one integer i+1, and c is 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables a, n, k, x, ind, and c remain unchanged, and the conditions on their values still hold.
