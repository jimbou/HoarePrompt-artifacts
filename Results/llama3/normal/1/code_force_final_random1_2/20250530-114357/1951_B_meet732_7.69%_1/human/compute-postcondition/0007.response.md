Postcondition: ***a is a list containing two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, x is an integer equal to the kth element of a. If c is 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the current value of a[i] is greater than x, then ind is a list containing one integer i, and i is not 0. Otherwise, ind remains an empty list, and i remains 0. If c is not 2, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
