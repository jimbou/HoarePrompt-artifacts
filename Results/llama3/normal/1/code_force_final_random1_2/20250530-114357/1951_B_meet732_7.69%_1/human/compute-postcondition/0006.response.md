Output State: **a is a list containing two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, x is an integer equal to the kth element of a, c is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and if the current value of a[i] is greater than x, then ind is a list containing one integer i, and i is not 0. Otherwise, ind remains an empty list, and i remains 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list a contains two integers n and k, followed by n integers a_1 to a_n, with n between 2 and 10^5, k between 1 and n, and each a_i between 1 and 10^9. The value of x is equal to the kth element of a. The value of c is 2. We exit the innermost loop or if statement. If any element a_i is greater than x, then ind contains that index i (which is not 0), otherwise ind is empty and i is 0.
