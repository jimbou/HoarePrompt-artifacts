Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list containing two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, x is an integer equal to the kth element of a, ind is an empty list, c is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] > x:
        ind.append(i)
        c += 1
    if c == 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *a is a list containing two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, x is an integer equal to the kth element of a. If c is 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the current value of a[i] is greater than x, then ind is a list containing one integer i, and i is not 0. Otherwise, ind remains an empty list, and i remains 0. If c is not 2, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *a is a list containing two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, x is an integer equal to the kth element of a. If c is 2 and the current value of a[i] is greater than x, then ind is a list containing one integer i+1, and c is 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and if c is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *a is a list containing two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, x is an integer equal to the kth element of a, n is n, c is 3 if a[i] is less than or equal to x, otherwise c is 4, ind is a list containing one integer i+1 if a[i] is less than or equal to x, otherwise ind is a list containing two integers i+1 and n, i is n. If c is equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
