Output State: **a is a list containing two integers n and k, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, x is an integer equal to the kth element of a, ind is a list containing one integer i+1, c is 3.**

In this output state, the list `a` remains unchanged, containing two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The value of `x` is still equal to the `k`th element of `a`. The list `ind` now contains one integer `i+1`, where `i+1` is not 0. The value of `c` has been incremented by 1, making it 3.
