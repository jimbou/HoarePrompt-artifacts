stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings of the same length as the integer. The sum of the lengths of all binary strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
