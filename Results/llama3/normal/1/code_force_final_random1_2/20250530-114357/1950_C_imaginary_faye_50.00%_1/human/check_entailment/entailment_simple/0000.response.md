Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to convert a time in 24-hour format to its equivalent time in 12-hour format. The program reads an integer t from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string s representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm).

The program then extracts the hour part (h) from the input string s. If the hour is '00', it prints '12' as the hour in 12-hour format. If the hour is less than or equal to 12, it prints the hour as is. If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and prefixes it with '0' to maintain the two-digit format.

Finally, the program prints the minute part of the input string (s[2:]) and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on whether the hour is greater than or equal to 12 or not.

The program's logic is correct and aligns with the problem description. It handles all possible cases for the hour in 24-hour format and correctly converts them to their 12-hour format equivalents.

Correctness: **True**
