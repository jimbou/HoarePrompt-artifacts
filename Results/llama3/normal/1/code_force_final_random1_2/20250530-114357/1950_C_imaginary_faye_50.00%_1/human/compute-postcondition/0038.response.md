The code prints the minute part of the input string, which is the substring of the input string starting from the 3rd character (index 2) to the end, and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour part of the input string. If the hour part of the input string is greater than or equal to 12, 'PM' is printed; otherwise, 'AM' is printed.

Output: **mm (where mm is the minute part of the input string), [AM/PM] (where AM/PM depends on the hour part of the input string)**
