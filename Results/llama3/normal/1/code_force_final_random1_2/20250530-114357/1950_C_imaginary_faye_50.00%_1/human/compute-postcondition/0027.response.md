Output: **stdin contains t-1 strings, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm), s is the input string, h is the hour part of the input string. If the hour part of the input string is '00', '12' is printed. Otherwise, if the hour part of the input string is less than or equal to 12, the hour part of the input string is printed. Otherwise, the hour part of the input string minus 12 is printed, prefixed with '0'. The code prints the minute part of the input string (s[2:]) and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on whether the hour part of the input string is greater than or equal to 12 or not.**
