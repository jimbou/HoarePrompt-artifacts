The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is less than the integer value of the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is t-1. For the loop to execute again, t must be t. 
State: **stdin contains t strings, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm), s is the tth string, h is the hour part of the tth string. If h is '00', '12' is printed. If h is not '00' and less than or equal to 12, the hour part of the tth string is printed. Otherwise, '0' followed by the integer value of h minus 12 is printed, and this is printed: the minutes part of the tth string which is s[2:], and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on whether the hour part of the tth string is greater than or equal to 12 or not**
