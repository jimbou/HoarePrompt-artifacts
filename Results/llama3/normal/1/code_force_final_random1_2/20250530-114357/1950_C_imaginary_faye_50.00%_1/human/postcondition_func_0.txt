Converts 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format for a given number of input times. For each input time, it prints the hour in 12-hour format (01-12), followed by the minutes, and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour. If the input hour is 00, it prints 12. If the input hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and prints the result, prefixed with '0' if necessary.
