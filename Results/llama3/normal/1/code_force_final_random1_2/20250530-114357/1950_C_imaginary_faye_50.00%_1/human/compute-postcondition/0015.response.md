Output: **stdin contains t-1 strings, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm), s is the first string, h is the hour part of the first string. If h is '00', '12' is printed. If h is not '00' and less than or equal to 12, the hour part of the first string is printed. Otherwise, '0' followed by the integer value of h minus 12 is printed, and this is printed: the minutes part of the first string which is s[2:], and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on whether the hour part of the first string is greater than or equal to 12 or not**
