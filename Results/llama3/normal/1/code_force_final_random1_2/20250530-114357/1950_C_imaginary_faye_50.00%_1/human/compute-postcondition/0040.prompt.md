Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1440) followed by t strings, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm).
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    h = s[:2]
    if h == '00':
        print('12', end='')
    elif int(h) <= 12:
        print(h, end='')
    else:
        print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
    print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: stdin contains t-1 strings, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm), s is the first string, h is the hour part of the first string. If h is '00', '12' is printed. If h is not '00' and less than or equal to 12, the hour part of the first string is printed. Otherwise, '0' followed by the integer value of h minus 12 is printed, and this is printed: the minutes part of the first string which is s[2:], and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on whether the hour part of the first string is greater than or equal to 12 or not

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: stdin contains t-1 strings, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm), s is the input string, h is the hour part of the input string. If the hour part of the input string is '00', '12' is printed. Otherwise, if the hour part of the input string is less than or equal to 12, the hour part of the input string is printed. Otherwise, the hour part of the input string minus 12 is printed, prefixed with '0'. The code prints the minute part of the input string (s[2:]) and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on whether the hour part of the input string is greater than or equal to 12 or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: stdin contains t-1 strings, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm), s is the input string, h is the hour part of the input string. If the hour part of the input string is '00', '12' is printed. Otherwise, if the hour part of the input string is less than or equal to 12, the hour part of the input string is printed. Otherwise, the hour part of the input string minus 12 is printed. , and this is printed: the minute part of the input string and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on whether the hour part of the input string is greater than or equal to 12 or not




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
