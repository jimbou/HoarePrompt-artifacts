The code prints the minute part of the first string `s` (from index 2 to the end), followed by either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour part `h` of the first string. If `h` is greater than or equal to 12, 'PM' is printed; otherwise, 'AM' is printed.
Output: **mm (where mm is the minute part of the first string s), AM/PM (where AM/PM depends on the hour part h of the first string s)**
