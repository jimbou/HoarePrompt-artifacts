Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly converts 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format for a given number of input times. 

Here's why:

1. It correctly handles the case when the input hour is 00, by printing 12.
2. It correctly handles the case when the input hour is greater than 12, by subtracting 12 from the hour and printing the result, prefixed with '0' if necessary.
3. It correctly prints the minutes and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all possible cases for the input hour. The use of the ternary operator `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` is a clever way to print 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour.

Correctness: **True**
