Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format.
3. It extracts the hour `h` from the string `s` using slicing (`s[:2]`).
4. It checks if the hour is '00' and if so, prints '12' as the hour in 12-hour format.
5. If the hour is not '00', it checks if it is less than or equal to 12. If so, it prints the hour as is.
6. If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and prints the result, padding with a leading zero if necessary.
7. It prints the minutes from the original string `s` using slicing (`s[2:]`).
8. It determines whether the time is AM or PM based on the hour and prints the corresponding string.

Correctness: **True**
