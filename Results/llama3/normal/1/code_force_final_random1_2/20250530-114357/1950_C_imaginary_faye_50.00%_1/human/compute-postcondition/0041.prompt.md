You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1440) followed by t strings, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm).
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: stdin is empty, s is the last string, h is the hour part of the last string. If the hour part of the last string is '00', '12' is printed. Otherwise, if the hour part of the last string is less than or equal to 12, the hour part of the last string is printed. Otherwise, the hour part of the last string minus 12 is printed, prefixed with '0'. The code prints the minute part of the last string (s[2:]) and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on whether the hour part of the last string is greater than or equal to 12 or not.

```

Return Postconditions: stdin is empty, s is the last string, h is the hour part of the last string. If the hour part of the last string is '00', '12' is printed. Otherwise, if the hour part of the last string is less than or equal to 12, the hour part of the last string is printed. Otherwise, the hour part of the last string minus 12 is printed, prefixed with '0'. The code prints the minute part of the last string (s[2:]) and either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on whether the hour part of the last string is greater than or equal to 12 or not.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
