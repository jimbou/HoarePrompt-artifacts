Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly converts 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format for a given number of input times. 

Here's why:

1. The program correctly handles the case when the input hour is 00, printing 12 instead.
2. It correctly handles the case when the input hour is less than or equal to 12, printing the hour as is.
3. It correctly handles the case when the input hour is greater than 12, subtracting 12 from the hour and printing the result, prefixed with '0' if necessary.
4. It correctly appends 'AM' or 'PM' to the output based on the input hour.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
