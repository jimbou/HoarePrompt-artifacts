Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the hour is between 13 and 23. In this case, the program should print the hour minus 12, but it does not handle the case where the hour is greater than 12 and less than 24.

For example, if the input is "14:34", the program should print "02:34 PM", but it will print "0:34 PM" instead.

The correct code should be:

```
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('{:02d}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

In this corrected code, the format specifier `{:02d}` is used to ensure that the hour is always printed with two digits, padding with zeros if necessary.
