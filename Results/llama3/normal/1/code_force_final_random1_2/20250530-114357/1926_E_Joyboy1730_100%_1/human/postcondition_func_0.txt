The function reads a series of inputs from stdin, where the first input is an integer t representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent input is a pair of integers n and k. For each test case, it generates a sequence of integers L by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible integer m from n, such that n - m is non-negative, and appending m to L. It then iterates through L, keeping track of the cumulative sum tot and the power of 2 pow. If the cumulative sum tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of tot and the current element in L, it prints the result of the expression 2 to the power of the number of elements in L minus 1, multiplied by 2 times k minus tot minus 1. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and the variables t, n, k, and L in a final state.
