Output: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is constrained by conditions involving tot and the second element in the list a, _ is 1, L is a list containing integers m where m is (n+1)//2 and must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains t-4 inputs, tot is equal to the next element in the list a plus the previous value of tot, pow is 4, a is the third element in the list, and this is printed: 4 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)**
