Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is a list containing the value m which is the integer part of (n+1)/2, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

The code first calculates the value of `m` as the integer part of `(n + 1) / 2`, which is equivalent to the ceiling of `n / 2`. This value is then appended to the list `L`. The value of `n` is then decremented by `m`, effectively reducing it by half (rounded up). The other variables `t`, `k`, and `_` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as no input operations are performed in this code snippet.
