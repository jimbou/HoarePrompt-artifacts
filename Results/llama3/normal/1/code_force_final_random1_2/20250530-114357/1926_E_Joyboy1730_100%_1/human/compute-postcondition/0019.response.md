The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`, where `pow` is 2, `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), and `tot` is a value that is not explicitly defined in the precondition.
Since the exact value of `tot` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the expression.
Output: ** `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), `n` is 0, `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), `_` is 0, `L` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `L`, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), `tot` is a, `pow` is 2, and the result of the expression 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed**
