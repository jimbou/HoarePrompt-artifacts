The only variable in the loop head is variable `a`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `L`. If the list has at least 3 values the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `L` has at least two values of `m`, `a` is the second value in `L`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `L` must have at least 3 values and `a` is the third value in the list.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 1, k is an integer, _ is 2, L is a list containing at least three values of m, stdin contains t-7 inputs, tot is a plus a plus a, pow is 4 * pow, m is (n + 1) // 2, a is the third value in L**
