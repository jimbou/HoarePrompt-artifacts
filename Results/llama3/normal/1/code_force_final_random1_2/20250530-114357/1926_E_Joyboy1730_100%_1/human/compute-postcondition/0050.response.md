The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`. 

Here, `pow` is 4, `k` is constrained by conditions involving `tot` and the second element in the list `a`, and `tot` is equal to the next element in the list `a` plus the previous value of `tot`.

Since the exact values of `k` and `tot` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **4 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) (where k is constrained by conditions involving tot and the second element in the list a, and tot is equal to the next element in the list a plus the previous value of tot)**
