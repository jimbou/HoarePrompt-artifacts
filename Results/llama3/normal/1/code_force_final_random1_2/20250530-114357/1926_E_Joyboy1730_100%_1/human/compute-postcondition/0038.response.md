According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list L. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, tot is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and a is the first element in the list.
State: **t is an integer (2 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 1, L is a list containing integers m where m is (n+1)//2 and must have at least 1 element, stdin contains t-4 inputs: each of the remaining t-4 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is 0, pow is 1, a is the first element in the list**
