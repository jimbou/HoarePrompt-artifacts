Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is a list containing the values m which are the integer parts of (n+1)/2, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is 0, pow is 1
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is a list containing at least 1 element which is 0, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is a, pow is 2, a is 0. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of tot and a, then the value 1 * (2 * k - 1) is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is a list containing at least 2 elements, a is the second element in L, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is a + a, pow is 4. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot + a, the result of the expression 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is a list containing at least 3 elements, a is the third element in L, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is 3a, pow is 8. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot + a, the result of the expression 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
