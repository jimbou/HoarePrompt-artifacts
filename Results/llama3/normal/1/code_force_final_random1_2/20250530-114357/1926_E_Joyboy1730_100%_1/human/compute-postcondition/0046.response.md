Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is constrained by conditions involving `tot` and the first element in the list `a`, `_` is 1, `L` is a list containing integers `m` where `m` is `(n+1)//2` and must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains `t-4` inputs, `tot` is equal to the next element in the list `a`, `pow` is 2, `a` is the next element in the list, and this is printed: 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) where k is constrained by conditions involving tot and the first element in the list a, and tot is equal to the next element in the list a**
