Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is an integer, _ is 2, L is a list containing at least one value of m, stdin contains t-6 inputs, tot is a plus a, pow is 2 * pow, m is (n + 1) // 2, a is the first value in L. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then the following is printed: 2 * (k - tot) - 1. Otherwise, no output is produced.**
