Output State: **t is an integer (2 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 1, L is a list containing integers m where m is (n+1)//2, stdin contains t-4 inputs: each of the remaining t-4 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is 0, pow is 1**

The code snippet does not modify any variables, so the output state remains the same as the initial state. The values of `tot` and `pow` are reassigned to 0 and 1, respectively, but these values are already present in the initial state, so no change occurs. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unaffected.
