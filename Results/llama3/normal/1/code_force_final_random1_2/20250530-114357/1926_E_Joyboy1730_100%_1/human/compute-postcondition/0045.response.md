The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`. 

`pow` is 2, and `tot` is equal to the next element in the list `a`. The value of `k` is constrained by conditions involving `tot` and the first element in the list `a`. 

However, the exact values of `tot` and `k` are not provided, so we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression.

Output: **2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) (where k is constrained by conditions involving tot and the first element in the list a, and tot is the next element in the list a)**
