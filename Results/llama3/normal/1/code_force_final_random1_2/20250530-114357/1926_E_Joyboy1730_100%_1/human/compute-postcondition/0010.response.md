Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is a list containing the values m which are the integer parts of (n+1)/2, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is 0, pow is 1**

The code initializes two new variables, `tot` and `pow`, and assigns them the values 0 and 1, respectively. The initial state remains unchanged, with `t` still being an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `n` being 0, `k` being an integer between 1 and `n`, `_` being 0, and `L` being a list containing the values `m` which are the integer parts of `(n+1)/2`. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged, containing `t-1` inputs, each being a pair of integers `n` and `k` with the given constraints.
