The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4). For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer (2 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 1, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-2 inputs: each of the remaining t-2 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is the sum of all elements in L, pow is 2 to the power of the number of elements in L**
