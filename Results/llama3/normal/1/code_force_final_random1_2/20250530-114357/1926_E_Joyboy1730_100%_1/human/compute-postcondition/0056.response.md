Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is an integer, k is an integer, _ is 2, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-6 inputs, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in the list a, pow is 2 to the power of the length of the list a.**

The first line assigns the integer values of the next two inputs from stdin to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since stdin initially contained `t-5` inputs, it now contains `t-6` inputs. The second line initializes an empty list `L`. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
