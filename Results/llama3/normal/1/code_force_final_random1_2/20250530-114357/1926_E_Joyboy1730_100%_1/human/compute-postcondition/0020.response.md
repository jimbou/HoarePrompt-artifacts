Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), `n` is 0, `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), `_` is 0, `L` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `L`, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), `tot` is a, `pow` is 2. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the result of the expression 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed.***
