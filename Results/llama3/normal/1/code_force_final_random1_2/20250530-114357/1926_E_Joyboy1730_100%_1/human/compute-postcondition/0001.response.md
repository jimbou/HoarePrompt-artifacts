To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable, but we'll consider its state as the iteration number). The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), stdin contains t inputs: each of the remaining t inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), _ is 0**
