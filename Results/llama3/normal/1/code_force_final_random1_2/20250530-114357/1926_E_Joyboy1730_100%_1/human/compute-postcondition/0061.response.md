The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is n - m. So for the loop to be executed one more time n - m must not be equal to 0.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n - m is not equal to 0, k is an integer, _ is 2, L is a list containing two elements: the original value of m and the new value of m which is (n + 1) // 2, stdin contains t-6 inputs, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in the list a, pow is 2 to the power of the length of the list a, m is (n + 1) // 2**
