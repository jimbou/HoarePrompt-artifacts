Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9) and n is not equal to 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is a list containing two values: the integer part of (n+1)/2 and the integer part of (n+1)/2, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the value of `m` is calculated as the integer part of `(n+1)/2`, which is then subtracted from `n`. The value of `m` is also appended to the list `L`. The value of `t`, `k`, and `_` remains unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` inputs, each a pair of integers `n` and `k`.
