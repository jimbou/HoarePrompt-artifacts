Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is a list containing the values m which are the integer parts of (n+1)/2, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 't' remains unchanged, 'n' becomes 0, 'k' remains unchanged, '_' remains 0, and 'L' becomes a list containing the integer parts of (n+1)/2 for each iteration of the loop. The stdin remains unchanged, containing t-1 inputs, each being a pair of integers n and k.
