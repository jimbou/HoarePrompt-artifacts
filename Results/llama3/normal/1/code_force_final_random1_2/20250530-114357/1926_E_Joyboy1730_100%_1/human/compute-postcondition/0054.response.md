Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is constrained by conditions involving tot and the last element in the list a, _ is 1, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-4 inputs, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in the list a, pow is 2 to the power of the length of the list a.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list L is empty, and the variable tot is equal to the sum of all elements in the list a. The variable pow is 2 to the power of the length of the list a. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
