To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects in it.

The loop head is `for a in L:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `a` and `L`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `L` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `L` contains at least 1 element, which is 0. For the loop to execute again, `L` must have at least 2 elements.

Since `a` is an element of `L`, we can adjust its state. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `a` must be the next element in `L`.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), `n` is 0, `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), `_` is 0, `L` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `L`, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), `tot` is a, `pow` is 2**
