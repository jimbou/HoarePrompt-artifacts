The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains `t+1` inputs, where the first input is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), and each of the remaining `t` inputs is a pair of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). After accepting the first input `t`, the stdin now contains `t` inputs: each of the remaining `t` inputs is a pair of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), stdin contains t inputs: each of the remaining t inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
