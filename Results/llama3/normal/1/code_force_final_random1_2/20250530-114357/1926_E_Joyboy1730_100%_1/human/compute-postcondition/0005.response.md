The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), So for the loop to be executed one more time n must not be equal to 0.
State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9) and n is not equal to 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is a list containing the value m which is the integer part of (n+1)/2, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
