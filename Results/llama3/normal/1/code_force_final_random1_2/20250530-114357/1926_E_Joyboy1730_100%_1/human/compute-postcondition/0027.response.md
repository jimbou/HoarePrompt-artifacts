Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is the sum of all elements in L, pow is 2 to the power of the number of elements in L. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of tot and the last element in L, then the result of the expression 2 to the power of the number of elements in L minus 1, multiplied by 2 times k minus tot minus 1, is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list L will be empty, and the variable tot will hold the sum of all elements that were in L. The variable pow will be 2 raised to the power of the number of elements that were in L. If the total sum of elements in L is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of the total and the last element in L, then the result of the expression 2 to the power of the number of elements in L minus 1, multiplied by 2 times k minus the total sum minus 1, is printed.
