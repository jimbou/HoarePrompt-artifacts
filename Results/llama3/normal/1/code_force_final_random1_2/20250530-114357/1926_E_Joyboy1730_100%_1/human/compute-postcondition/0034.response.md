The only variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is n - m and m is (n+1)//2. So for the loop to be executed one more time n needed to have been odd and n currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer (2 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is an odd integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 1, L is a list containing two integers m and m where m is (n+1)//2, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin contains t-4 inputs: each of the remaining t-4 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
