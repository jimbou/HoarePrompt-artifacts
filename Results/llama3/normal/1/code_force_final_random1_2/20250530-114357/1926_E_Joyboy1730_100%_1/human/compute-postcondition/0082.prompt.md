Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), stdin contains t inputs: each of the remaining t inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
        L.append(m)
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
        tot += a
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is the sum of all elements in L, pow is 2 to the power of the number of elements in L. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of tot and the last element in L, then the result of the expression 2 to the power of the number of elements in L minus 1, multiplied by 2 times k minus tot minus 1, is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is constrained by conditions involving tot and the last element in the list a, _ is 1, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-4 inputs, tot is equal to the sum of all elements in the list a, pow is 2 to the power of the length of the list a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is the number of iterations of the loop, k is an integer, _ is 2, L is a list containing the values of m from each iteration, stdin contains t-6 inputs, tot is the sum of all values in L, pow is 2 to the power of the number of iterations, m is (n + 1) // 2, a is the last value in L. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then the following is printed: 2 to the power of the number of iterations * (2 * (k - tot) - 1). Otherwise, no output is produced.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
