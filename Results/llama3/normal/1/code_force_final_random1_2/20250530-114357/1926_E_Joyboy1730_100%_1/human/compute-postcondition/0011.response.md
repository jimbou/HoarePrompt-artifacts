To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are variable `a` and list `L`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `L`. If the list `L` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `n` is 0, the list `L` should contain at least one element which is the integer part of `(n+1)/2`, which is 0.

So, for the loop to be executed, the list `L` must have at least 1 element and `a` is the first element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), `n` is 0, `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), `_` is 0, `L` is a list containing at least 1 element which is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is 0**
