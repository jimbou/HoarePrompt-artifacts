Output State: **t is an integer (2 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is an even integer (0 <= n <= 10^9), k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 1, L is a list containing three integers m, m, and m where m is (n+1)//2, tot is 0, pow is 1, stdin contains t-4 inputs: each of the remaining t-4 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
