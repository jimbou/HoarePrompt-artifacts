According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If n is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), which ensures that n is not equal to 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
