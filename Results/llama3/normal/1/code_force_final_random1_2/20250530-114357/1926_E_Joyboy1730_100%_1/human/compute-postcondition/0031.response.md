Output State: **t is an integer (2 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is an integer (0 <= n <= 10^9), k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 1, L is a list containing one integer m where m is (n+1)//2, stdin contains t-4 inputs: each of the remaining t-4 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is 0, pow is 1**

The code block modifies the values of `n` and `L`. The first line calculates the value of `m` as the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The second line subtracts `m` from `n`, effectively reducing `n` by half (rounded down). The third line appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. No other variables are affected by the code.
