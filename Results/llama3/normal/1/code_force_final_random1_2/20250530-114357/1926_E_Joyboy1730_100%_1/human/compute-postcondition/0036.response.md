Output State: **t is an integer (2 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 1, L is a list containing integers m where m is (n+1)//2, stdin contains t-4 inputs: each of the remaining t-4 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is 0, pow is 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 'n' becomes 0, and the list 'L' contains a sequence of integers 'm' where 'm' is the result of the expression '(n+1)//2'. The other variables remain unchanged.
