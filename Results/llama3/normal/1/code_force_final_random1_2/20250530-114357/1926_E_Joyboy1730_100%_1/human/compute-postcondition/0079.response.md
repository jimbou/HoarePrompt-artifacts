Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 1, k is an integer, _ is 2, L is a list containing at least three values of m, stdin contains t-7 inputs, tot is a plus a plus a, pow is 4 * pow, m is (n + 1) // 2, a is the third value in L. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then the program prints 4 * pow * (2 * (k - (a + a + a)) - 1).**
