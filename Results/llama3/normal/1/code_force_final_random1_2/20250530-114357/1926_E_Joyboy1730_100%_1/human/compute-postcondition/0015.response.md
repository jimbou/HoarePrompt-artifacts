Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), `n` is 0, `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), `_` is 0, `L` is a list containing at least 1 element which is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is 0. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`, then the value `1 * (2 * k - 1)` is printed.***
