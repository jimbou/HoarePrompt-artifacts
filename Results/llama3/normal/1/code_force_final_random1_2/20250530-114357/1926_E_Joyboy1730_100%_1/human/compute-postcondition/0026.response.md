Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is a list containing at least 3 elements, a is the third element in L, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is 3a, pow is 8. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot + a, the result of the expression 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.**

In this output state, the value of `tot` has been updated to `3a` because the first line of the code increments `tot` by the value of `a`. The second line of the code doubles the value of `pow`, making it 8. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
