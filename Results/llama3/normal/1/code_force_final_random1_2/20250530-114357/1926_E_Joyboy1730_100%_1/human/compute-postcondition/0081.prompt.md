Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is an integer, _ is 2, L is a list containing the values of m from each iteration, stdin contains t-6 inputs, tot is 0, pow is 1, m is (n + 1) // 2
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is an integer, _ is 2, L is a list containing at least one value of m, stdin contains t-6 inputs, tot is a plus a, pow is 2 * pow, m is (n + 1) // 2, a is the first value in L. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then the following is printed: 2 * (k - tot) - 1. Otherwise, no output is produced.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 1, k is an integer, _ is 2, L is a list containing at least two values of m, stdin contains t-7 inputs, tot is a plus a plus a, pow is 4 * pow, m is (n + 1) // 2, a is the second value in L. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then the following is printed: 4 * pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) where pow is 4 * pow, k is an integer, and tot is a plus a plus a.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 1, k is an integer, _ is 2, L is a list containing at least three values of m, stdin contains t-7 inputs, tot is a plus a plus a plus a, pow is 8 * pow, m is (n + 1) // 2, a is the third value in L. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot plus a, then the program prints 8 * pow * (2 * (k - (a + a + a)) - 1).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
