Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer (2 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 1, L is a list containing integers m where m is (n+1)//2, stdin contains t-4 inputs: each of the remaining t-4 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is 0, pow is 1
Code of the loop:
for a in L:
    if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
        print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
    tot += a
    pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 1, L is a list containing integers m where m is (n+1)//2 and must have at least 1 element, stdin contains t-4 inputs: each of the remaining t-4 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is equal to the first element in the list a, pow is 2, a is the first element in the list. If the current value of tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to the sum of tot and the first element in the list a, an odd number greater than or equal to 1 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is constrained by conditions involving tot and the first element in the list a, _ is 1, L is a list containing integers m where m is (n+1)//2 and must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains t-4 inputs, tot is equal to the next element in the list a plus the previous value of tot, pow is 4, a is the next element in the list. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot + a, then the expression 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed, where k is constrained by conditions involving tot and the first element in the list a, and tot is equal to the next element in the list a plus the previous value of tot.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, n is 0, k is constrained by conditions involving tot and the second element in the list a, _ is 1, L is a list containing integers m where m is (n+1)//2 and must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains t-4 inputs, pow is 8, tot is the original value of tot plus a.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
