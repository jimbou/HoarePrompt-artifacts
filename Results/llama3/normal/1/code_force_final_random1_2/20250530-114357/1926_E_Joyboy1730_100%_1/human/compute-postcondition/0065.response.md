To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `a` and the list `L`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `L` is not empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `L` to ensure it has at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer, `_` is 2, `L` is a list containing at least one value of `m`, `stdin` contains `t-6` inputs, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is (n + 1) // 2, `a` is the first value in `L`**
