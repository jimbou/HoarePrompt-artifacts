Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9) and n is greater than 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is a list containing three values: the integer part of (n+1)/2, the integer part of (n+1)/2, and the integer part of (n+1)/2, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
