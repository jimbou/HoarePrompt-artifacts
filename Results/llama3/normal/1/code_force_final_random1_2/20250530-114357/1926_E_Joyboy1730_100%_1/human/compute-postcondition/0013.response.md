The code prints the result of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`. 

Here, `pow` is 1, `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), and `tot` is 0. Since `tot` is less than `k`, `k - tot` will be equal to `k`. 

Therefore, the expression `2 * (k - tot) - 1` will be equal to `2 * k - 1`. 

Finally, multiplying this by `pow` (which is 1) will not change the value.

Output: **2k - 1 (where k is an integer between 1 and n inclusive)**
