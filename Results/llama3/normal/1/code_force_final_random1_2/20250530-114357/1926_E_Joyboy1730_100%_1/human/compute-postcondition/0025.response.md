Postcondition: ***t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), n is 0, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, L is a list containing at least 3 elements, a is the third element in L, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each of the remaining t-1 inputs is a pair of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), tot is a + a, pow is 4. If tot is less than k and k is less than or equal to tot + a, the result of the expression 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.***
