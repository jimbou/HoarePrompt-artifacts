To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` and `stdin`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the number of test cases remaining in `stdin`. If there are more test cases, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.

For the loop to execute again, `_` should be incremented by 1, and `stdin` should contain one fewer test case.

State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first test case, `s` is a string equal to the second test case, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, and the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, which is `x + y`, is being printed, and the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, which is `x + y`, is printed**
