Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in cases where the string contains overlapping substrings "map" and "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two separate substrings, but in reality, it should be counted as one, because removing the "p" in "map" will also remove the "p" in "pie", thus making the string beautiful by removing only one character. 

The program should be modified to handle such overlapping cases correctly.
