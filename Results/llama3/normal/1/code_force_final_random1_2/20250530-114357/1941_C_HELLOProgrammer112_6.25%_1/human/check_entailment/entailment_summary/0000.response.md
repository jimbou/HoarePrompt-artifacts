Reasoning:
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The problem requires counting the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful, which is equivalent to counting the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie'. The program correctly reads the input, counts the occurrences of these substrings, and prints their sum.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. The problem statement mentions that Rudolf wants to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. In the case where the string contains overlapping occurrences of 'map' and 'pie', simply counting the occurrences of these substrings would not give the correct result. For example, in the string "mapie", counting the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' would give 2, but the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful is actually 1.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle overlapping occurrences of 'map' and 'pie'. One possible solution is to use a sliding window approach to count the occurrences of these substrings.

Correctness: **False**
