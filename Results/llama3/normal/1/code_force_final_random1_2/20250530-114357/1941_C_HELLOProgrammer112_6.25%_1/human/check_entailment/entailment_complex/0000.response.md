Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string s, and prints their sum. The program also handles the case where the string s is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain 'map' or 'pie') by printing 0.

The program's logic is sound, and it does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws. The use of the count() method to count the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' is efficient and accurate.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given examples, which further confirms its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
