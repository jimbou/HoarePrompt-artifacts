Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) and then a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = int(input())
    s = input()
    x = s.count('map')
    y = s.count('pie')
    print(x + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is an integer at least 1, s is a string, x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s, y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in s, which is x + y, is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is an integer equal to the first test case, s is a string equal to the second test case, x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s, y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s, _ is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, and the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in s, which is x + y, is being printed, and the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in s, which is x + y, is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is an integer equal to the second test case, s is a string equal to the third test case, x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the third test case, y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the third test case, _ is 2, stdin contains t-6 test cases, and the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the third test case, which is x + y, is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
