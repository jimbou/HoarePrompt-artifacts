Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string and prints their sum, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program handles all possible cases, including when the string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain "map" or "pie"), and when it contains multiple occurrences of these substrings.

Correctness: **True**
