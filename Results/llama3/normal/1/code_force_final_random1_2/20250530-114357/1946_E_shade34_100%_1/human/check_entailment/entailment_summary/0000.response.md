Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program uses the facts array to store the factorial values modulo 10^9 + 7, and the func_2 function to calculate the modular inverse of a number. The main part of the program checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is n. If these conditions are not met, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of permutations by multiplying the modular inverses of the factorial values and the differences between the prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program also handles the case where the prefix maximums and suffix maximums are not in increasing order.

Correctness: **True**
