Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the provided indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Function 1, `func_1(a, b)`, appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `b`. This is a common technique used in number theory to find the modular inverse, which is essential for solving the problem.

Function 2, `func_2(a, b)`, uses the result from Function 1 to calculate the modular multiplication of `a` and the modular inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007`. This is likely used to calculate the number of permutations.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The program does not handle the case where `a` is 0 in Function 1. This would cause a division by zero error.
2. The program does not check if the input values are valid. For example, it does not check if `n` is within the range `[1, 2 * 10^5]`.
3. The program does not handle the case where `m1` or `m2` is 0. This would cause an error when trying to access the elements of the `p` or `s` arrays.
4. The program does not calculate the number of permutations correctly. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions, but the program only calculates the modular multiplication of `a` and the modular inverse of `b`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
