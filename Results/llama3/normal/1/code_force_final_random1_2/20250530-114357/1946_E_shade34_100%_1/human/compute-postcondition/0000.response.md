Output State: **a and b are integers, b is a prime number and a and b are relatively prime, c and d are returned by func_1(b, 1000000007)**.

In this output state, the values of a and b remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The code only assigns the return values of func_1(b, 1000000007) to c and d. The values of c and d are now determined by the output of func_1, but the exact values are not specified as the function's behavior is not defined.
