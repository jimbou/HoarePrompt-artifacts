Functionality: **This function takes two integers, a and b, as input, where b is non-zero. It performs a series of conditional checks and calculations, ultimately returning a tuple of two values. If b is zero, it returns (1, 0). If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments, and returns the results in reverse order. If a is a multiple of b, it returns (1, -((a // b) - 1)). Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns the second result and the first result minus the product of the integer division of a by b and the second result.**
