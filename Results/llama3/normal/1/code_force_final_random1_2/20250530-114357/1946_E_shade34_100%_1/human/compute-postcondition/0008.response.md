Output State: **The program returns two values: 1 and -(a // b - 1). The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, a // b is an integer. Because a is larger than or equal to b, a // b is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, a // b - 1 is a non-negative integer, and -(a // b - 1) is a non-positive integer.**
