Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations of length n, where the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are provided. The program uses two functions, func_1 and func_2, to calculate the number of different permutations that could have been guessed.

Function func_1 is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number 'a' modulo 'b', where 'b' is a prime number and 'a' and 'b' are relatively prime. This function is used in func_2 to calculate the product of 'c' and 'a' modulo 1000000007.

Function func_2 is used to calculate the product of 'c' and 'a' modulo 1000000007, where 'c' is a value returned by func_1(b, 1000000007), 'a' is an integer that is relatively prime to 'b', and 'b' is a prime number.

The main program first checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is equal to 1 and the last suffix maximum is equal to n. If these conditions are not met, the program prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of permutations using the provided prefix and suffix maximums, and prints the result modulo 1000000007.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and uses the functions func_1 and func_2 to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse and the product of 'c' and 'a' modulo 1000000007, respectively. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
