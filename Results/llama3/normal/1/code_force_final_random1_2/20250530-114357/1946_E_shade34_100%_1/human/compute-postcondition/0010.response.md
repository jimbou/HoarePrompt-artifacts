Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a non-zero integer, `a` is larger than or equal to `b`, the remainder of `a` divided by `b` is not equal to 0, `c` and `d` are the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the conditions that `b` is non-zero, `a` is larger than or equal to `b`, and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` is not equal to 0 are still valid. The new variables `c` and `d` are assigned the return values of the function `func_1(b, a % b)`, where `a % b` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.
