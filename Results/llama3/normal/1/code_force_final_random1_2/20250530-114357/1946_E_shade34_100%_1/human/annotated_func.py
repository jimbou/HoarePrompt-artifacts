#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is non-zero.
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The value 1 is an integer and 0 is also an integer.

    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: `d` and `c`. `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a)`, and `c` is the first return value of `func_1(b, a)`. Both `d` and `c` are returned in reverse order.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is non-zero, and b is not equal to 0. a is larger than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns two values: 1 and -(a // b - 1). The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, a // b is an integer. Because a is larger than or equal to b, a // b is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, a // b - 1 is a non-negative integer, and -(a // b - 1) is a non-positive integer.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is non-zero, and b is not equal to 0. a is larger than or equal to b. The remainder of a divided by b is not equal to 0
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: `d` and `c - a // b * d`. `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`, where `b` is a non-zero integer and `a % b` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, which is not equal to 0. The second value in the tuple is the result of subtracting the product of `a // b` (the integer division of `a` by `b`) and `d` from `c`, where `c` is the first return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, a and b, as input, where b is non-zero. It performs a series of conditional checks and calculations, ultimately returning a tuple of two values. If b is zero, it returns (1, 0). If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments, and returns the results in reverse order. If a is a multiple of b, it returns (1, -((a // b) - 1)). Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b, and returns the second result and the first result minus the product of the integer division of a by b and the second result.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, b is a prime number and a and b are relatively prime.
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the product of 'c' and 'a' modulo 1000000007, where 'c' is a value returned by func_1(b, 1000000007), 'a' is an integer that is relatively prime to 'b', and 'b' is a prime number.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the product of 'c' and 'a' modulo 1000000007, where 'c' is a value returned by func_1(b, 1000000007), 'a' is an integer that is relatively prime to 'b', and 'b' is a prime number. It takes two parameters, 'b' and 'a', and returns their product modulo 1000000007.
