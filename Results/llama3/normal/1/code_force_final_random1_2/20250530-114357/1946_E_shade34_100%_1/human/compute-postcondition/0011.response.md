Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: `d` and `c - a // b * d`. `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`, where `b` is a non-zero integer and `a % b` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, which is not equal to 0. The second value in the tuple is the result of subtracting the product of `a // b` (the integer division of `a` by `b`) and `d` from `c`, where `c` is the first return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`.**
