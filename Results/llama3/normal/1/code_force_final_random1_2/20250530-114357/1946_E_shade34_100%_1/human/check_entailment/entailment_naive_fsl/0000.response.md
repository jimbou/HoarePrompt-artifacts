Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem asks to output the number of different permutations that could have been guessed, given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums. However, the provided program does not calculate this number.

The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which seem to be related to modular arithmetic, but they are not used to solve the problem. The program does not take any input or calculate the number of permutations.

For example, if the input is `n = 4, m1 = 2, m2 = 3, p = [1, 2], s = [2, 3, 4]`, the program does not output the correct number of permutations, which is 3.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
