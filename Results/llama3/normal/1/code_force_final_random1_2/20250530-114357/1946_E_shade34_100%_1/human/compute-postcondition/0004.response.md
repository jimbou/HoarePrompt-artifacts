Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `b` is non-zero, `a` is less than `b`, `c` is the first return value of `func_1(b, a)`, `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a)`**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a`, and assigns the return values to `c` and `d`, respectively. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can conclude that `c` and `d` are assigned the return values of `func_1(b, a)`. The relationship between `a` and `b` remains the same, with `a` being less than `b`.
