Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the condition.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it checks if the minimum number of diagonals (k) is equal to the maximum possible (4n - 2). If this is the case, it prints half of this number plus one, which is the correct answer because coloring half of the diagonals plus one cell will cover all diagonals.
3. If the minimum number of diagonals is not equal to the maximum possible, it prints the ceiling of half of the minimum number of diagonals. This is also correct because coloring at least half of the diagonals will cover at least half of the diagonals, and taking the ceiling ensures that we cover at least the minimum number of diagonals required.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing all test cases and printing the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
