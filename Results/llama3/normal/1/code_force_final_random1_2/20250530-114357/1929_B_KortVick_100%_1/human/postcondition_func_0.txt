The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of a square grid size (n) and a minimum number of diagonals (k) that should contain at least one colored cell. For each test case, it prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the condition. If the minimum number of diagonals is equal to the maximum possible (4n - 2), it prints half of this number plus one; otherwise, it prints the ceiling of half of the minimum number of diagonals. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
