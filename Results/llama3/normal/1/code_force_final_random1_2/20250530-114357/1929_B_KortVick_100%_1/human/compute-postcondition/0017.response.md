To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `_` is within the range of `t`. Since `_` is currently 1, the loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 1.

To adjust the state, we need to increment `_` by 1, so it becomes 2. The value of `t` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `n`, `k`, and the contents of `stdin` are not directly related to the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `_` is 2, and stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers.**
