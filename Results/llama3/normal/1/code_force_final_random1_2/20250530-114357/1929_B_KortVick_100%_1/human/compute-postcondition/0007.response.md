The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of half of the value of `k`. Since `k` is an integer and its value is not equal to `4 * n - 2`, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the ceiling of half of `k`.

Output: **The ceiling of half of k (where k is an integer)**
