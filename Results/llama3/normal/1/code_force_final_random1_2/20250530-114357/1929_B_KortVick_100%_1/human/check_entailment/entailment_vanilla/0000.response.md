Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n, such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The given program uses the following logic:

- If all diagonals need to be colored (i.e., k = 4n - 2), then the minimum number of cells to be colored is k // 2 + 1. This is because each diagonal has n cells, and we need to color at least one cell in each diagonal. Since there are k diagonals, we need to color at least k // 2 cells. However, since k is even (4n - 2 is always even), k // 2 would leave one diagonal uncolored. Therefore, we add 1 to k // 2 to ensure that all diagonals are colored.

- If not all diagonals need to be colored (i.e., k < 4n - 2), then the minimum number of cells to be colored is ceil(k / 2). This is because we can color every other diagonal, which would require ceil(k / 2) cells.

The program uses the ceil function from the math module to calculate the ceiling of k / 2, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2.

The program correctly handles the two cases and provides the minimum number of cells that need to be colored.

Correctness: **True**
