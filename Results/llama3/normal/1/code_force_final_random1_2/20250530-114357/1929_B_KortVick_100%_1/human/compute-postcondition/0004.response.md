To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given information and the code.

Given:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `n` and `k` are integers.
- `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- The relationship between `n` and `k` is given by the equation: `4n - 2 = k`.

The code to be executed is:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

From the given equation `4n - 2 = k`, we can express `k` in terms of `n`. However, the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, but we know their relationship.

The expression `k // 2 + 1` involves integer division (`//`) which returns the largest whole number less than or equal to the result of the division, and then adds 1 to it.

Since we don't have explicit values for `n` and `k`, but we know that `k = 4n - 2`, let's substitute `k` in the expression:

Given `k = 4n - 2`, 

The expression becomes `(4n - 2) // 2 + 1`.

Simplifying this, we get `2n - 1 + 1` (since `(4n - 2) // 2` simplifies to `2n - 1`), which further simplifies to `2n`.

So, the expression `k // 2 + 1` simplifies to `2n`.

Therefore, the code will print the value of `2n`, where `n` is an integer part of the relationship `4n - 2 = k`.

Output: **2n (where n is an integer as defined by the relationship 4n - 2 = k)**
