Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `_` is 2, and stdin contains `t-5` lines of input, each containing two integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the two integers from the first line of input from stdin. The stdin now contains `t-5` lines of input, each containing two integers, since one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
