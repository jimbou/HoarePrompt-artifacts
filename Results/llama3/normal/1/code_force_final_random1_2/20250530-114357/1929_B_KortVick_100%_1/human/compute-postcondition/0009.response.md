Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers. If 4 times `n` minus 2 equals `k`, the value of `2 * n` is being printed. Otherwise, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is being printed.***
