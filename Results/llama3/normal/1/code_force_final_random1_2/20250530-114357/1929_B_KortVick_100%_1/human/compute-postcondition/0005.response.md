The code prints the value of `k // 2 + 1`, which is the result of the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1.
Since `k` is equal to 4 times `n` minus 2, we can substitute this expression into the print statement to get `4 * n - 2 // 2 + 1`.
Simplifying this expression, we get `2 * n - 1 + 1`, which is equal to `2 * n`.
Therefore, the code prints the value of `2 * n`.
Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers. The current value of `n` and `k` are such that 4 times `n` minus 2 equals `k`, and the value of `2 * n` is being printed**
