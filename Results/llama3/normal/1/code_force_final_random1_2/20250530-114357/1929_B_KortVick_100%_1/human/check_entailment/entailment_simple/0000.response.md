Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The given program first reads the number of test cases t. Then, for each test case, it reads the size of the square grid n and the minimum number of diagonals k.

If k is equal to the total number of diagonals (4n - 2), the program prints k // 2 + 1. This is because in this case, we need to color at least half of the diagonals, and since we can't color a fraction of a diagonal, we need to color one more cell to cover the remaining diagonals.

If k is not equal to the total number of diagonals, the program prints ceil(k / 2). This is because we need to color at least half of the k diagonals, and since we can't color a fraction of a diagonal, we need to color the ceiling of half of k.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
