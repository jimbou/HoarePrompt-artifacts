Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `_` is 1, and stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the two integers read from the first line of input. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it was not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, as it was not used or modified by the code. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines of input, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
