The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively.

Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, the first line of input is read and assigned to `n` and `k`.

The value of `_` is not affected by this code, so it remains 0.

The output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers.**
