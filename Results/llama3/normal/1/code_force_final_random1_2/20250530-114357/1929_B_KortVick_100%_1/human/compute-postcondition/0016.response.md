Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `_` is 1, and stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers. If `4 * n - 2` equals `k`, then the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed. Otherwise, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed.**
