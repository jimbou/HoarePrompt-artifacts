The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that the first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) â€” the number of test cases.

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The remaining input lines, which contain the test cases, are still in the standard input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input, each containing two integers n and k**
