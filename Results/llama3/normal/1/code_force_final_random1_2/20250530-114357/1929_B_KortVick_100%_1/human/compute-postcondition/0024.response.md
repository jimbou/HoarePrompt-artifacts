Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 997 (inclusive), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `_` is `t`, and stdin is empty. If `4 * n - 2` equals `k`, the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 is printed. Otherwise, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will have a value between 0 and 997 (inclusive), indicating the number of times the loop has executed. The variables `n` and `k` will still be integers, and the variable `_` will have the same value as `t`, indicating the number of iterations completed. The standard input (stdin) will be empty, as all input lines will have been processed by the loop. The loop will print the result of the calculation based on the condition `4 * n - 2 == k`, either the integer division of `k` by 2 plus 1 or the ceiling of `k` divided by 2.
