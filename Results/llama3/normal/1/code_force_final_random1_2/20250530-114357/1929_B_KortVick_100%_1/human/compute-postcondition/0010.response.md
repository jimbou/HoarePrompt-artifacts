To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` and `k` are integers, `_` is 1, and stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers.**
