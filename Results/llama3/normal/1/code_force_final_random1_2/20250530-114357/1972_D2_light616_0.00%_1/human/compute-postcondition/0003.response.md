To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6), _ is 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**
