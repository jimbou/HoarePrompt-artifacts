Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `m` is greater than or equal to 15, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)) + min(n / ((2 + 2) * 2), m // ((2 + 2) * 2)) + min(n / ((2 + 3) * 2), m // ((2 + 3) * 3)). Otherwise, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)) + min(n / ((2 + 3) * 2), m // ((2 + 3) * 3)).**

The value of `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of `n` divided by the product of `x + y` and `x`, and `m` divided by the product of `x + y` and `y`. Since `x` is 2 and `y` is 3, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1. Therefore, the new value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to the sum of the minimum of `n` divided by 8 and `m` divided by 3, the minimum of `n` divided by 12 and `m` divided by 3, the minimum of `n` divided by 16 and `m` divided by 4, and the minimum of `n` divided by 20 and `m` divided by 15.
