Output State: **x is 1, cnt is greater than or equal to 0, n is greater than or equal to 1, m is greater than or equal to 1, y is greater than or equal to 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of x and y is 1, then cnt is greater than or equal to min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)). Otherwise, cnt is greater than or equal to 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: x remains 1, cnt is greater than or equal to 0, n and m are greater than or equal to 1, y is greater than or equal to 1, and stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of x and y is 1, then cnt is greater than or equal to the minimum of n / ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y). Otherwise, cnt is greater than or equal to 0.
