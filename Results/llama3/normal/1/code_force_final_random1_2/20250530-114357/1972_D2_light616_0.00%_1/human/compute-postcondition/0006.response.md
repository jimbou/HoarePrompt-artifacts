Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `stdin` contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 * 10^6), `_` is 2, and the function `func_1()` has been executed**

The code snippet only calls the function `func_1()` without any arguments or assignments. Since the function `func_1()` has already been executed, its execution does not change the state of the program. The values of `t`, `stdin`, `_` remain the same as in the initial state.
