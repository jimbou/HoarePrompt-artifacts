Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 12, `m` is greater than or equal to 24, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)) + min(n / ((2 + 2) * 2), m // ((2 + 2) * 2)) + min(n / ((2 + 4) * 2), m // ((2 + 4) * 4)). Otherwise, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)) + min(n / ((2 + 2) * 2), m // ((2 + 2) * 2)) + min(n / ((2 + 3) * 2), m // ((2 + 3) * 3)).**

In natural language, the output state is: x has been incremented by 1, so its new value is 3. The values of y, n, and m remain the same. The stdin still contains one input: an integer. The value of cnt is still dependent on the greatest common divisor of x and y, but since x is now 3, the greatest common divisor of x and y is 1. Therefore, cnt is greater than or equal to the sum of four terms, each of which is the minimum of a division of n and a division of m.
