The value of `y` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `y` was 1, so the new value of `y` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains 1 input: an integer. The greatest common divisor of `x` and 1 is always 1, so `cnt` is still updated based on the minimum divisions involving `n` and `m` for the given value of `x`. 

Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to 3, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than 9, `m` is greater than or equal to 24, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1 is 1, `cnt` is updated based on the minimum divisions involving `n` and `m` for the given value of `x`.**
