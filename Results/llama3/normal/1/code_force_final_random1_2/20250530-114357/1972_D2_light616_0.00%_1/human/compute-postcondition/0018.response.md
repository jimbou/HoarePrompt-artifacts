The variable in the loop head is variable x and n, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables x and n.  If x * x is less than or equal to n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 2, n is greater than or equal to 1. x * x is 4, so for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than or equal to 5.
State: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of 2 and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / ((2 + `y`) * 2), `m` // ((2 + `y`) * `y`)). Otherwise, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0.**
