Output State: **`x` is 1, `y` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 12, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is greater than or equal to 1 + min(n / 16, m // 12). Otherwise, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0.**

The value of `y` is incremented by 1, so `y` becomes 4. The values of the other variables are not affected. The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is still 1, so the condition for `cnt` remains the same. The stdin still contains 1 input: an integer.
