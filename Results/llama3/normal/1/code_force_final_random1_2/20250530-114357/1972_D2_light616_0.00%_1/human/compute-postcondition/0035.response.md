The variable in the loop head is variable x and n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x and n.  If x * x is less than or equal to n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is 3 and n is greater than or equal to 12, So for the loop to be executed one more time x must be less than or equal to 3 and n must be greater than 9.
State: **`x` is less than or equal to 3, `y` is 5, `n` is greater than 9, `m` is greater than or equal to 24, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)) + min(n / ((2 + 2) * 2), m // ((2 + 2) * 2)) + min(n / ((2 + 4) * 2), m // ((2 + 4) * 4)). Otherwise, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)) + min(n / ((2 + 2) * 2), m // ((2 + 2) * 2)) + min(n / ((2 + 3) * 2), m // ((2 + 3) * 3))**
