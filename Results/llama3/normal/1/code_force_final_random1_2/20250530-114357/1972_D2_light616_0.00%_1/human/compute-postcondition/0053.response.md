Output State: `x` is greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, `cnt` is greater than or equal to the sum of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all `x` and `y` that satisfy the loop conditions, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer.

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `x` will be greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, and the value of `cnt` will be greater than or equal to the sum of the minimum values of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all `x` and `y` that satisfy the loop conditions. The values of `n`, `m`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains 1 input: an integer.
