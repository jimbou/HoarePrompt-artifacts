Postcondition: ***`x` is 2, `y` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)).***
