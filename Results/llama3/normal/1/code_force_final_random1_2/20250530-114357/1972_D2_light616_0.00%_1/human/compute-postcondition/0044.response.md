Postcondition: ***`x` is less than or equal to 3, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 15, `m` is greater than or equal to 10, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n / ((x + 2) * x)` and `m // ((x + 2) * 2)`.***
