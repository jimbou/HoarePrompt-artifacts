Output State: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is greater than or equal to 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of 2 and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / ((2 + `y`) * 2), `m` // ((2 + `y`) * `y`)). Otherwise, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `x` being 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `cnt` has been updated to reflect the new value of `x`. If the greatest common divisor of 2 and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is greater than or equal to the minimum of `n` divided by ((2 + `y`) * 2) and `m` divided by ((2 + `y`) * `y`). Otherwise, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0.
