Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4. The stdin now contains t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m, where n and m are between 1 and 2 * 10^6.
