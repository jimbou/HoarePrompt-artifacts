Reasoning: 

The problem statement requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b.

Function `func_1()` calculates and prints the count of pairs of coprime numbers (x, y) such that (x + y) * x ≤ n and (x + y) * y ≤ m, where n and m are input integers. This function seems to be correctly implementing the required calculation.

Function `func_2()` reads an integer t from standard input, then reads t lines from standard input, each containing two positive integers n and m, and executes the function `func_1()` t times. This function is correctly handling the test cases.

Since both functions are working together to solve the problem as described, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
