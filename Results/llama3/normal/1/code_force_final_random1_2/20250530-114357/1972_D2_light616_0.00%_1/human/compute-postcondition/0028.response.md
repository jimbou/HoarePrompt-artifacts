Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `m` is greater than or equal to 8, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)) + min(n / ((2 + 2) * 2), m // ((2 + 2) * 2)). Otherwise, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)).**

The value of `y` is incremented by 1, so `y` is now 3. The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, since 2 and 3 are coprime. The values of `n`, `m`, `cnt`, and stdin are not affected by the code. The condition for `cnt` is updated accordingly, as the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is now 1.
