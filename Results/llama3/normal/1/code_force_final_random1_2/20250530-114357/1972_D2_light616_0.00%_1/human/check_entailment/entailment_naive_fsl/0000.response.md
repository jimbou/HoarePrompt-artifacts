Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.

The program uses a clever approach by iterating over the possible values of x and y, where x is the greatest common divisor of a and b, and y is the other factor. It then checks if the sum of x and y is a factor of both a and b, and if so, increments the count.

The program also correctly handles the case where x or y is 1, which is a special case that needs to be handled separately.

The time complexity of the program is O(sqrt(n) + sqrt(m)), which is efficient enough to handle the given constraints.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the examples provided, and it produces the correct output in all cases. I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
