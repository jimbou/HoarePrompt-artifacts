Postcondition: ***`x` is less than or equal to 3, `y` is 1, `n` is greater than 9, `m` is greater than or equal to 24, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. The greatest common divisor of `x` and 1 is 1. The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)) + min(n / ((2 + 2) * 2), m // ((2 + 2) * 2)) + min(n / ((2 + 4) * 2), m // ((2 + 4) * 4)).***
