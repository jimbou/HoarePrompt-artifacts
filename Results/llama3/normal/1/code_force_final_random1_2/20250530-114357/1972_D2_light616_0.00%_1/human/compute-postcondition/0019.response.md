Output State: **`x` is 2, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3), `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer.**

The value of `y` is now 1. The greatest common divisor of 2 and `y` is 1. Therefore, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / ((2 + `y`) * 2), `m` // ((2 + `y`) * `y`)), which is min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3). The values of the other variables are not affected.
