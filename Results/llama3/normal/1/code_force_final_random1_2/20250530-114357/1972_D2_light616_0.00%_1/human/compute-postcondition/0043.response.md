Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to 3, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 15, `m` is greater than or equal to 10, `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n / ((x + 2) * x)` and `m // ((x + 2) * 2)`, stdin contains 1 input: an integer**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of two expressions. The first expression is `n / ((x + 2) * x)`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 15 and `x` is less than or equal to 3. The second expression is `m // ((x + 2) * 2)`, where `m` is greater than or equal to 10 and `x` is less than or equal to 3. The minimum of these two expressions is added to `cnt`. The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` remain the same, and the stdin still contains 1 input: an integer.
