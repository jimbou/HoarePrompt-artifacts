Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to 3, `y` is 1, `n` is greater than 9, `m` is greater than or equal to 24, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1 is 1, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)) + min(n / ((2 + 2) * 2), m // ((2 + 2) * 2)) + min(n / ((2 + 4) * 2), m // ((2 + 4) * 4)). Otherwise, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)) + min(n / ((2 + 2) * 2), m // ((2 + 2) * 2)) + min(n / ((2 + 3) * 2), m // ((2 + 3) * 3))**

In natural language, the output state is: `x` is still less than or equal to 3, `y` is now 1, `n` is still greater than 9, `m` is still greater than or equal to 24, and stdin still contains 1 input: an integer. The value of `cnt` depends on the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1. Since 1 is a divisor of every number, the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1 is always 1. Therefore, `cnt` is greater than or equal to the sum of four terms: min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3), min(n / 6, m // 3), min(n / 8, m // 4), and min(n / 10, m // 8).
