Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `m` is greater than or equal to 8, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)) + min(n / ((2 + 2) * 2), m // ((2 + 2) * 2)), stdin contains 1 input: an integer.**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`, which is `min(n / (4 * 2), m // (4 * 2))`. The condition on `cnt` is updated to reflect this change. The stdin still contains one input: an integer.
