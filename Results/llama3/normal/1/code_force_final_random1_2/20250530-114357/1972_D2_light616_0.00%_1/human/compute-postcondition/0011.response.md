Output State: **`x` is 1, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 6, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0.**

The value of `y` is incremented by 1, so `y` is now 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is still 1, so `cnt` is greater than or equal to 1. The stdin still contains 1 input: an integer.
