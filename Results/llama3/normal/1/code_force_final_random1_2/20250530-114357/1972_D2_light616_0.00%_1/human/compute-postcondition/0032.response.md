Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `m` is greater than or equal to 15, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 2, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)) + min(n / ((2 + 3) * 2), m // ((2 + 3) * 3)).**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is now 2, not 1. The values of `x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains 1 input: an integer.
