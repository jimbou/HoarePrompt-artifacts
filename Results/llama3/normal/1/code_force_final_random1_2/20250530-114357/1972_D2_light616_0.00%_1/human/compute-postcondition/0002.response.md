Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6), _ is 0, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `_` remain unchanged. The only change is that the function `func_1()` has been executed, but since its implementation is not provided, we cannot determine its specific effects on the program state. Therefore, we simply acknowledge that the function has been executed without altering the values of the variables.
