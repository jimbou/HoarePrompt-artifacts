Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6), _ is 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

The code snippet is an empty function call, `func_1()`, which does not modify any variables or read from stdin. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state. The values of `t`, stdin, `_`, and the execution status of `func_1()` are unchanged.
