Postcondition: ***`x` is less than or equal to 3, `y` is 1, `n` is greater than 9, `m` is greater than or equal to 24, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1 is 1, `cnt` is updated based on the minimum divisions involving `n` and `m` for the given value of `x`.***
