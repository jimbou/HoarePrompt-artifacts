Postcondition: ***`x` is 1, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 12, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is greater than or equal to 1 + min(n / 16, m // 12). Otherwise, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0.***
