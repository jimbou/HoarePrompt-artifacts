Reasoning:

The problem asks us to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The given Python program attempts to solve this problem. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case, while `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. In `func_1`, the program initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0. It then reads the values of `n` and `m` from the input.

3. The program uses a while loop to iterate over possible values of `x`. The loop condition is `x * x <= n`, which ensures that `x` does not exceed the square root of `n`.

4. Inside the loop, the program uses another while loop to iterate over possible values of `y`. The loop condition is `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`, which ensures that the product of `x + y` and `x` (or `y`) does not exceed `n` (or `m`).

5. Inside the inner loop, the program checks if `math.gcd(x, y)` is equal to 1. If it is, the program increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. This is because the number of valid pairs for the current values of `x` and `y` is equal to the minimum of the number of multiples of `(x + y) * x` in the range `[1, n]` and the number of multiples of `(x + y) * y` in the range `[1, m]`.

6. After the inner loop finishes, the program increments `x` by 1 and repeats the outer loop.

7. Once the outer loop finishes, the program prints the value of `cnt`, which represents the total number of valid pairs for the current test case.

8. In `func_2`, the program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and calls `func_1` for each test case using a for loop.

The program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of valid pairs for each test case and handles multiple test cases.

Correctness: **True**
