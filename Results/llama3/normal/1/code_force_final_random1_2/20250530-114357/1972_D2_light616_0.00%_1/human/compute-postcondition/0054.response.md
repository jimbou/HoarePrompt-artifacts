Output State: **x is less than or equal to the square root of n, cnt is greater than or equal to the sum of min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)) for all x and y such that x * x <= n and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m and math.gcd(x, y) == 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, m is greater than or equal to 1, y is greater than or equal to 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that x is less than or equal to the square root of n, cnt is greater than or equal to the sum of min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)) for all x and y such that x * x <= n and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m and math.gcd(x, y) == 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, m is greater than or equal to 1, y is greater than or equal to 1, and stdin contains 1 input: an integer.
