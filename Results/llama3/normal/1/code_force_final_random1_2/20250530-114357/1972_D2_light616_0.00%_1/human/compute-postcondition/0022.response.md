Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 1, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)), `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. The current values of `x` and `y` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `x` and `y` remain the same, which are 2 and 1 respectively. The value of `cnt` is increased by the minimum of `n` divided by 6 and `m` divided by 3. The values of `n` and `m` are still greater than or equal to 6 and 3 respectively. The stdin still contains 1 input: an integer. The current values of `x` and `y` are still coprime.
