Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to 3, `y` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 18, `m` is greater than or equal to 18, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, then `cnt` is greater than or equal to 1.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. The values of the other variables remain the same. The condition regarding the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and its relation to `cnt` is still valid, but since `y` is now 4, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` may have changed. The stdin still contains 1 input: an integer.
