Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6), _ is t-1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `_` will be one less than the initial value of `t`, and the function `func_1()` will have been executed `t` times. The state of `t` and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
