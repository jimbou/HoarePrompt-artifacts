Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to 4, `y` is greater than or equal to 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 18, `m` is greater than or equal to 18, stdin contains 1 input: an integer. If the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1 is 1, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)) + min(n / ((2 + 2) * 2), m // ((2 + 2) * 2)) + min(n / ((2 + 3) * 2), m // ((2 + 3) * 3)) + min(n / ((2 + 4) * 2), m // ((2 + 4) * 4)) + min(n / ((2 + 5) * 2), m // ((2 + 5) * 5)). Otherwise, `cnt` is greater than or equal to min(`n` / 8, `m` // 3) + min(n / ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1)) + min(n / ((2 + 2) * 2), m // ((2 + 2) * 2)) + min(n / ((2 + 2) * 2), m // ((2 + 2) * 2)) + min(n / ((2 + 4) * 2), m // ((2 + 4) * 4)) + min(n / ((2 + 5) * 2), m // ((2 + 5) * 5)).**

The value of `x` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to 4. The values of `y`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, as they are greater than or equal to 5, 18, and 18, respectively. The stdin still contains 1 input: an integer. The value of `cnt` has been updated based on the minimum divisions involving `n` and `m` for the given value of `x`, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
