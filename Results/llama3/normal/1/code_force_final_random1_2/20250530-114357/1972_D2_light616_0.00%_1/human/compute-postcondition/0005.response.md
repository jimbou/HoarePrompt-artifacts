To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times. The variable `_` is the loop counter, and `t` is the upper limit.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4
* `stdin` contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 * 10^6)
* `_` is 1
* The function `func_1()` has been executed

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* The loop counter `_` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 2.
* The value of `t` remains the same, as it is the upper limit of the loop.
* The state of `stdin` remains the same, as it is not affected by the loop counter.
* The function `func_1()` has already been executed, so its state remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `stdin` contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 * 10^6), `_` is 2, and the function `func_1()` has been executed**
