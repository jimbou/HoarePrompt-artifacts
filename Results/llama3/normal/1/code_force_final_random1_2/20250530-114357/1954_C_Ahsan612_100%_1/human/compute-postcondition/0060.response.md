Output State: **a is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9 and the length of a is greater than its current value, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, new is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to its original value plus 1, stdin contains 2t - 7 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

The code updates the values of `new[i]` and `new2[i]` based on the minimum and maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables, `a`, `b`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
