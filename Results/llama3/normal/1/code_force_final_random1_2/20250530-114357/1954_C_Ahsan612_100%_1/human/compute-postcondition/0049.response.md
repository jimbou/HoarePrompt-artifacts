Output State: **a is a non-empty list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9 and the first element of b is the same as the first element of a, new is a list of integers where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b and the rest are None, new2 is a list of integers where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b and the rest are None, i is 1, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

In this output state, the first elements of `new` and `new2` have been updated to the maximum and minimum of the first elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The rest of the elements in `new` and `new2` remain as None. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the contents of `stdin` are unaffected by the code execution.
