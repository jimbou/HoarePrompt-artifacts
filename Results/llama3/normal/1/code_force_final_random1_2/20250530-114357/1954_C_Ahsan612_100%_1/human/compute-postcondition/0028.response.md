Output State: **a is a list of integers where the first `len(a)` elements are equal to the first `len(a)` elements of `b`, and the second elements of `a` and `b` are equal, `b` is a list of integers with at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `new` is a list of integers where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of `a` and `b`, and the second element is the maximum of the second elements of `a` and `b`, and the rest are None, `new2` is a list of integers where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of `a` and `b`, and the second element is the minimum of the second elements of `a` and `b`, and the rest are None, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains 2t - 5 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

The code modifies the values of `new`, `new2`, and `i`. The first line assigns the maximum value between the second elements of `a` and `b` to the second element of `new`. The second line assigns the minimum value between the second elements of `a` and `b` to the second element of `new2`. The third line increments `i` by 1, making it equal to 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
