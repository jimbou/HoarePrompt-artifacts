Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, new is a list of None values with the same length as a, new2 is a list of None values with the same length as a, i is 0, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a non-empty list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9 and the first element of b is the same as the first element of a, new is a list of integers where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b and the rest are None, new2 is a list of integers where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b and the rest are None, i is 1, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9 and a has at least 2 elements, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9 and the first element of b is the same as the first element of a and the second element of b is the same as the second element of a, new is a list of integers where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b and the second element is the maximum of the second elements of a and b and the rest are None, new2 is a list of integers where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b and the second element is the minimum of the second elements of a and b and the rest are None, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9 and a has at least 3 elements, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9 and the first three elements of b are the same as the first three elements of a, new is a list of integers where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element is the maximum of the second elements of a and b, and the third element is the maximum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of integers where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element is the minimum of the second elements of a and b, and the third element is the minimum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest are None, i is 3, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
