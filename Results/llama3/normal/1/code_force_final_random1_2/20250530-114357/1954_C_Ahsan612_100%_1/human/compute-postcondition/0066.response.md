The code prints a string of digits formed by concatenating the elements of the list `new`, where each element of `new` is the minimum of the corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`. The lists `a` and `b` contain strings of digits from 1 to 9.

Output: **a is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, new is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 7 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, and a string of digits formed by concatenating the elements of the list new is being printed**
