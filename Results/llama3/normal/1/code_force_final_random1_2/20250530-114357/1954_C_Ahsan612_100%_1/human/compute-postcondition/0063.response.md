Output State: **a is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, new is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 7 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list 'a' and 'b' remain unchanged, 'new' contains the minimum values of corresponding elements in 'a' and 'b', 'new2' contains the maximum values of corresponding elements in 'a' and 'b', and 'i' is equal to the length of 'a'. The stdin remains unchanged.
