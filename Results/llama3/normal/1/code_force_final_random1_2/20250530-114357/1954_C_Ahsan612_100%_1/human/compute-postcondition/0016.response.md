Output State: **a is a list of integers where the first `len(a)` elements are equal to the first `len(a)` elements of `b`, `b` is a list of integers with at least `len(a)+2` elements, `new` is a list of values where the first `len(a)` elements are the minimum of the first `len(a)` elements of `a` and `b`, and the rest are None, except for the `i+1`-th element which is the minimum of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `new2` is a list of values where the first `len(a)` elements are the maximum of the first `len(a)` elements of `a` and `b`, and the rest are None, except for the `i+1`-th element which is the maximum of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `i` is less than len(a) and is incremented by 1, stdin contains `2t - 2` lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

The code modifies the values of `new[i]`, `new2[i]`, and `i`. The first line assigns the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`, and the second line assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`. The third line increments the value of `i` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
