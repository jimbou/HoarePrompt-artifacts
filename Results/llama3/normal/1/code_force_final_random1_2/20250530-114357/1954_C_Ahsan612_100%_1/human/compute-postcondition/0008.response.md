Output State: **a is a list of integers where the first len(a) elements are equal to the first len(a) elements of b, b is a list of integers with at least len(a) elements, new is a list of values where the first len(a) elements are the maximum of the first len(a) elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values where the first len(a) elements are the minimum of the first len(a) elements of a and b, and the rest are None, i is len(a), stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the first len(a) elements of a are equal to the first len(a) elements of b, and the rest of the elements in a and b are unchanged. The first len(a) elements of new are the maximum of the first len(a) elements of a and b, and the rest are None. The first len(a) elements of new2 are the minimum of the first len(a) elements of a and b, and the rest are None. The variable i is equal to len(a), indicating that the loop has executed len(a) times. The stdin remains unchanged, containing 2t - 2 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.
