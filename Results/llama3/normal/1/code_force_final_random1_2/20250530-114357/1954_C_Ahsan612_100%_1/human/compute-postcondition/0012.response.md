Output State: **a is a list of integers where the first `len(a)` elements are equal to the first `len(a)` elements of `b`, `b` is a list of integers with at least `len(a)` elements, `new` is a list of values where the first `len(a)` elements are the minimum of the first `len(a)` elements of `a` and `b`, and the rest are None, except for the `i`-th element which is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new2` is a list of values where the first `len(a)` elements are the maximum of the first `len(a)` elements of `a` and `b`, and the rest are None, except for the `i`-th element which is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, stdin contains `2t - 2` lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

The code snippet modifies the `new` and `new2` lists by swapping their values at index `i` with the minimum and maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, respectively. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
