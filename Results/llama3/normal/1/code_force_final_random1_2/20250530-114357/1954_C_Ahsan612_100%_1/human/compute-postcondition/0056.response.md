Output State: **a is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, new is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 7 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `new`, `new2`, and `i`. The first line assigns the maximum value between the `i-th` elements of `a` and `b` to the `i-th` element of `new`. The second line assigns the minimum value between the `i-th` elements of `a` and `b` to the `i-th` element of `new2`. The third line increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was not equal to the length of `a` initially, after the increment, `i` is now equal to the length of `a`. The stdin remains unchanged, containing 2t - 7 lines, each with a string of digits from 1 to 9.
