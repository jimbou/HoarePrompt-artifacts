The variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and a.  If i is less than len(a), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is equal to len(a), So for the loop to be executed one more time i must be less than len(a). For i to be less than len(a), len(a) must be greater than its current value. So, a must have at least one more element than its current value.
State: **a is a list of integers where the first `len(a)` elements are equal to the first `len(a)` elements of `b`, `b` is a list of integers with at least `len(a)+2` elements, `new` is a list of values where the first `len(a)` elements are the minimum of the first `len(a)` elements of `a` and `b`, and the rest are None, except for the `i+1`-th element which is the minimum of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `new2` is a list of values where the first `len(a)` elements are the maximum of the first `len(a)` elements of `a` and `b`, and the rest are None, except for the `i+1`-th element which is the maximum of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `i` is less than len(a), stdin contains `2t - 2` lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**
