Output State: **a is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9 and a has at least 2 elements, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9 and the first element of b is the same as the first element of a and the second element of b is the same as the second element of a, new is a list of integers where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b and the second element is the maximum of the second elements of a and b and the rest are None, new2 is a list of integers where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b and the second element is the minimum of the second elements of a and b and the rest are None, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `new` now has its second element set to the maximum of the second elements of `a` and `b`, and the list `new2` now has its second element set to the minimum of the second elements of `a` and `b`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing 2t - 6 lines, each with a string of digits from 1 to 9.
