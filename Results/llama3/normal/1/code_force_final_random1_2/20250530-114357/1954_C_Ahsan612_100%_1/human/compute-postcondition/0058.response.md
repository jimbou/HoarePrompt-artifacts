Output State: **a is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, new is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 7 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `new`, `new2`, and `i`. The first line assigns the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`, effectively updating the `i-th` element of `new` to be the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. The second line assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`, effectively updating the `i-th` element of `new2` to be the maximum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. The third line increments `i` by 1, making it equal to the length of `a`. The remaining variables and stdin remain unchanged.
