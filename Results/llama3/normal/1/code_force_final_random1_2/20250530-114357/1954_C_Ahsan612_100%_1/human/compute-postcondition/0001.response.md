Output State: **a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, new is a list of None values with the same length as a, new2 is a list of None values with the same length as a, i is 0, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

In this output state, the variables a and b are lists of integers, each containing the digit values from the first two lines of stdin. The variables new and new2 are lists of None values, each with the same length as a. The variable i is initialized to 0. Stdin now contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, since two lines have been read and processed.
