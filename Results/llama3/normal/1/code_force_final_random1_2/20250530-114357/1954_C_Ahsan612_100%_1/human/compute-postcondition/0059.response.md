The variables in the loop head are i and a, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than the length of `a`. This means that the length of `a` needs to be greater than its current value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9 and the length of a is greater than its current value, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, new is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is less than the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 7 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**
