Output State: **a is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, new is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

The loop will continue to execute as long as the current index `i` is less than the length of list `a` and the elements at the current index in lists `a` and `b` are equal. In each iteration, it updates the corresponding elements in lists `new` and `new2` with the maximum and minimum of the elements at the current index in lists `a` and `b`, respectively, and increments the index `i`.

After the loop finishes executing, the index `i` will be equal to the length of list `a`, and lists `new` and `new2` will contain the maximum and minimum of the corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`, respectively. The state of the other variables, including list `b` and the contents of `stdin`, will remain unchanged.
