The only object in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the value returned by `int(input())`. If `_` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to the number of iterations that have been executed so far, which is equal to `len(a)`. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be equal to `len(a) + 1` and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than `len(a) + 1`. Also, since `int(input())` is called at the beginning of each iteration, the number of lines in `stdin` must be reduced by 1, so `stdin` contains `2t - 3` lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first len(a) elements are equal to the first len(a) elements of b, `b` is a list of integers with at least len(a) + 1 elements, `new` is a list of values where all elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, `new2` is a list of values where all elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, `i` is equal to len(a), `stdin` contains 2t - 3 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, and this is printed: a string containing the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b for the first len(a) elements**
