Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9. Each pair of strings has the same length.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, list(input())))
    b = list(map(int, list(input())))
    new = [None] * len(a)
    new2 = [None] * len(a)
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
    if i != len(a):
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
        while i < len(a):
            new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of integers where the first len(a) elements are equal to the first len(a) elements of b, b is a list of integers with at least len(a) elements, new is a list of values where all elements are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values where all elements are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to len(a), stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, and this is printed: a string containing the maximum values of the corresponding elements of a and b for the first len(a) elements

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is a list of integers where the first len(a) elements are equal to the first len(a) elements of b, b is a list of integers with at least len(a) + 1 elements, new is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to len(a), stdin contains 2t - 5 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, and a string of digits is printed where each digit is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, new is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 7 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, and a string of digits formed by concatenating the elements of the list new2 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
