Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of integers where the first len(a) elements are equal to the first len(a) elements of b, b is a list of integers with at least len(a) + 1 elements, new is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to its original value plus 1, stdin contains 2t - 5 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of integers where the first `len(a)` elements are equal to the first `len(a)` elements of `b`, `b` is a list of integers with at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `new` is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `new2` is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to its original value plus 2 and the original value of `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, `stdin` contains `2t - 5` lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a is a list of integers where the first `len(a)` elements are equal to the first `len(a)` elements of `b`, `b` is a list of integers with at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `new` is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `new2` is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to its original value plus 1, `stdin` contains `2t - 5` lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is a list of integers where the first `len(a)` elements are equal to the first `len(a)` elements of `b`, `b` is a list of integers with at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `new` is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `new2` is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, `i` is equal to its original value plus 2, `stdin` contains `2t - 5` lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, and `a` has at least one more element than its original length plus 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
