The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input().  If the input() is at least 1 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9. Each pair of strings has the same length. So for the loop to be executed  the input() is at least 1 and the _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9. Each pair of strings has the same length, _ is 0, input() is at least 1**
