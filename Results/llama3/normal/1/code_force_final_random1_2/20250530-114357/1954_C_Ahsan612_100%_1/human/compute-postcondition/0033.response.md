Output State: **a is a list of integers where the first len(a) elements are equal to the first len(a) elements of b, b is a list of integers with at least len(a) + 1 elements, new is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to its original value plus 1, stdin contains 2t - 5 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

The code executes three lines that affect the state of the variables. The first line assigns the maximum value between the i-th elements of `a` and `b` to the i-th element of `new`. The second line assigns the minimum value between the i-th elements of `a` and `b` to the i-th element of `new2`. The third line increments the value of `i` by 1. No other variables are affected. The state of `a`, `b`, `new`, `new2`, and stdin remains the same, except for the updated values of `new` and `new2` at index `i`, and the incremented value of `i`.
