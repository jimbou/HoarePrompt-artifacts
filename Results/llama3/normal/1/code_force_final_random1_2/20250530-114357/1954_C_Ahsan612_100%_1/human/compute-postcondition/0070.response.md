Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, followed by 2t lines of strings of digits from 1 to 9. It then processes each pair of strings, comparing them digit by digit. If the strings are identical up to a certain point, it outputs two new strings: one with the maximum digit at each position and one with the minimum digit at each position. If the strings differ at some point, it outputs two new strings: one with the minimum digit at each position up to the point of difference and the maximum digit at each position thereafter, and one with the maximum digit at each position up to the point of difference and the minimum digit at each position thereafter. The function repeats this process t times, printing the resulting strings to stdout.**
