Output State: **a is a list of integers where the first element is equal to the first element of b, and a has at least two elements with the second element equal to the second element of b, b is a list of integers with at least two elements, new is a list of values where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element is the maximum of the second elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of values where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element is the minimum of the second elements of a and b, and the rest are None, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `new`, `new2`, and `stdin` remain unchanged from the initial state, as they are not modified by the code. The only changes are to the values of `new` and `new2`, which now have their second elements set to the maximum and minimum of the second elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2.
