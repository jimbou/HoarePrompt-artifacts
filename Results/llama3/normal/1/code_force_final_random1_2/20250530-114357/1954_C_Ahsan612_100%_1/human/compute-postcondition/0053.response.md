Output State: **a is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9 and a has at least 3 elements, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9 and the first three elements of b are the same as the first three elements of a, new is a list of integers where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b, the second element is the maximum of the second elements of a and b, and the third element is the maximum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of integers where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b, the second element is the minimum of the second elements of a and b, and the third element is the minimum of the third elements of a and b, and the rest are None, i is 3, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9**

In this output state, the first three elements of `new` and `new2` have been updated to be the maximum and minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`, respectively. The value of `i` has been incremented to 3. The rest of the elements in `new` and `new2` remain None. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains 2t - 6 lines of input.
