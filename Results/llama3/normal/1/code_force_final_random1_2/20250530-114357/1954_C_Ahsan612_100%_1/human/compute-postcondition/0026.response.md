Output State: **a is a list of integers where the first len(a) elements are equal to the first len(a) elements of b, b is a list of integers with at least len(a) + 1 elements, new is a list of integers where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b, and the rest are None, new2 is a list of integers where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b, and the rest are None, i is 1, stdin contains 2t - 5 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

In this output state, the first element of `new` is the maximum of the first elements of `a` and `b`, and the first element of `new2` is the minimum of the first elements of `a` and `b`. The rest of the elements in `new` and `new2` remain None. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The state of `a`, `b`, and stdin remains unchanged.
