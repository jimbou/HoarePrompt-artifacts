Output State: **a is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9 and the length of a is greater than its current value plus 1, b is a list of integers where each element is a string of digits from 1 to 9, new is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to its original value plus 2, stdin contains 2t - 7 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

The code modifies the values of `new`, `new2`, and `i`. The first line updates the `i-th` element of `new` to be the minimum of the `i-th` elements of `a` and `b`. The second line updates the `i-th` element of `new2` to be the maximum of the `i-th` elements of `a` and `b`. The third line increments `i` by 1. The values of `a`, `b`, and the remaining elements of `new` and `new2` are not affected. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged as no input operations are performed.
