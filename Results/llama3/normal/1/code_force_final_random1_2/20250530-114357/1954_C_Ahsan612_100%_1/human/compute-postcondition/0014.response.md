Output State: **a is a list of integers where the first `len(a)` elements are equal to the first `len(a)` elements of `b`, `b` is a list of integers with at least `len(a)+1` elements, `new` is a list of values where the first `len(a)` elements are the minimum of the first `len(a)` elements of `a` and `b`, and the rest are None, except for the `i+1`-th element which is the minimum of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `new2` is a list of values where the first `len(a)` elements are the maximum of the first `len(a)` elements of `a` and `b`, and the rest are None, except for the `i+1`-th element which is the maximum of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, stdin contains `2t - 2` lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

The code updates the `new` and `new2` lists by assigning the minimum and maximum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the `i`-th elements of `new` and `new2`, respectively. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. No other variables are affected.
