Output State: **a is a list of integers where the first len(a) elements are equal to the first len(a) elements of b, b is a list of integers with at least len(a) + 1 elements, new is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to len(a), stdin contains 2t - 5 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that 'a' and 'b' remain unchanged, 'new' and 'new2' are lists where each element is the minimum and maximum of the corresponding elements of 'a' and 'b' respectively, 'i' is equal to the length of 'a', and 'stdin' remains unchanged.
