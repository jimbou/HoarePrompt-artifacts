The only variables in the loop head are variable _ and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin. If stdin contains at least 2t - 4 lines, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains 2t - 5 lines. So for the loop to be executed one more time stdin must contain at least 2t - 4 lines.
State: **a is a list of integers where the first len(a) elements are equal to the first len(a) elements of b, b is a list of integers with at least len(a) + 1 elements, new is a list of integers where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of integers where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, i is equal to len(a), stdin contains 2t - 4 lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9, and a string of digits is printed where each digit is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b**
