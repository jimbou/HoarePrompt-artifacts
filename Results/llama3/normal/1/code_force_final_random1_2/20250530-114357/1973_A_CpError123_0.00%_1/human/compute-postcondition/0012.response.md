Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers that must have at least 1 sublist, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order. `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first sublist in the list, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to half of `total_points` (i.e., `total_matchs` is equal to half of `p1 + p2 + p3`), and `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. The current value of `egalites` is less than 0. If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing two elements -1. Otherwise, `resultats` is a list containing two elements -1 if the sum of the first sublist (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is an odd number, otherwise `resultats` is a list containing a single element -1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `resultats` now contains two elements -1, regardless of whether the sum of the first sublist is even or odd.
