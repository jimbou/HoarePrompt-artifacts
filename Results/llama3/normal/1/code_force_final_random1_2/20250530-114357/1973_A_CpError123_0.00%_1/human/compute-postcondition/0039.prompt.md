Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order, `resultats` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p1, p2, p3 in cas_de_test:
    total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
    if total_points % 2 != 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    total_matchs = total_points // 2
    if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
        resultats.append(-1)
        continue
    egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
    if egalites < 0:
        resultats.append(-1)
    else:
        resultats.append(egalites // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers that must have at least 1 sublist, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order. `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first sublist in the list, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to half of `total_points` (i.e., `total_matchs` is equal to half of `p1 + p2 + p3`), and `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If `egalites` is less than 0, then `resultats` is a list containing two elements -1 if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, otherwise `resultats` is a list containing two elements -1 if the sum of the first sublist (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is an odd number, otherwise `resultats` is a list containing a single element -1. If `egalites` is greater than or equal to 0, then `resultats` is a list containing either two elements -1 (if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`), or an empty list (if the sum of the first sublist (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is an even number), or a list containing a single element -1 (if the sum of the first sublist (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is an odd number), or a list containing a single element equal to `egalites // 2` (if the sum of the first sublist (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is an odd number and `total_matchs` is not greater than 3 and `p3` is not greater than `total_matchs`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers that must have at least 2 sublists, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order. p1, p2, p3 are the second sublist in the list, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to half of p1 + p2 + p3, egalites is equal to total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1), and total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3. If egalites is less than 0, then resultats is a list containing two elements -1 if total_matchs is greater than 3 or p3 is greater than total_matchs, otherwise resultats is a list containing two elements -1 if the sum of the second sublist (p1 + p2 + p3) is an odd number, otherwise resultats is a list containing a single element -1. If egalites is greater than or equal to 0, then resultats is a list containing either two elements -1 (if total_matchs is greater than 3 or p3 is greater than total_matchs), or an empty list (if the sum of the second sublist (p1 + p2 + p3) is an even number), or a list containing a single element -1 (if the sum of the second sublist (p1 + p2 + p3) is an odd number), or a list containing a single element equal to egalites // 2 (if the sum of the second sublist (p1 + p2 + p3) is an odd number and total_matchs is not greater than 3 and p3 is not greater than total_matchs). If total_points is odd, resultats has an additional element -1 appended to it. If total_matchs is greater than 3 or p3 is greater than total_matchs, then resultats has an additional element -1 appended to it. If egalites is less than 0, then resultats has an additional element -1 appended to it. Otherwise, resultats has an additional element egalites // 2 appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers that must have at least 3 sublists, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order. p1, p2, p3 are the third sublist in the list, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to half of p1 + p2 + p3, egalites is equal to total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1), and total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3. If egalites is less than 0, then resultats is a list containing two elements -1 if total_matchs is greater than 3 or p3 is greater than total_matchs, otherwise resultats is a list containing two elements -1 if the sum of the third sublist (p1 + p2 + p3) is an odd number, otherwise resultats is a list containing a single element -1. If egalites is greater than or equal to 0, then resultats is a list containing either two elements -1 (if total_matchs is greater than 3 or p3 is greater than total_matchs), or an empty list (if the sum of the third sublist (p1 + p2 + p3) is an even number), or a list containing a single element -1 (if the sum of the third sublist (p1 + p2 + p3) is an odd number), or a list containing a single element equal to egalites // 2 (if the sum of the third sublist (p1 + p2 + p3) is an odd number and total_matchs is not greater than 3 and p3 is not greater than total_matchs). If total_points is odd, resultats has an additional element -1 appended to it. If total_matchs is greater than 3 or p3 is greater than total_matchs, then resultats has an additional element -1 appended to it. If egalites is less than 0, then resultats has an additional element -1 appended to it. Otherwise, resultats has an additional element egalites // 2 appended to it. If total_points is odd, resultats has an additional element -1 appended to it. resultats has an additional element -1 appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
