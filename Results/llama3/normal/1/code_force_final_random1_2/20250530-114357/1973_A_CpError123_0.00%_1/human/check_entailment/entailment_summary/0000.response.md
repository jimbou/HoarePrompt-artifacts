Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends, given their final scores. The program takes into account the constraints that the scores are non-negative, the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number of times, and the scores are sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program first checks if the total points are odd, in which case it returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario. Then, it calculates the total number of matches and checks if it is greater than 3 or if the maximum score is greater than the total number of matches. If either condition is true, it returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario.

If the input is valid, the program calculates the number of draws by subtracting twice the difference between the maximum score and the other two scores from the total points. If the result is negative, it returns -1, as this is not a valid scenario. Otherwise, it returns the result divided by 2, as each draw contributes 2 points to the total.

The execution summary indicates that the function performs the correct calculations and returns the expected results for the given test cases.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
