Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is an empty list, and resultats is a list of integers where each integer is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than or equal to 15.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains a positive integer, `cas_de_test` becomes an empty list because all its sublists have been processed, and `resultats` is a list of integers where each integer is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than or equal to 15. The value of each integer in `resultats` depends on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` in each sublist of `cas_de_test` and the calculations performed in the loop body.
