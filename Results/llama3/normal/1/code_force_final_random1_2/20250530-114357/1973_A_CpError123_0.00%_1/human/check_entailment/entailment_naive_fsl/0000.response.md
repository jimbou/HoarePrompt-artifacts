Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three players. The program first checks if the total number of points is even, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be valid. Then, it calculates the total number of matches played, which must be less than or equal to 3. If these conditions are not met, the program returns -1, indicating that the scores are not valid.

The program then calculates the number of draws by subtracting the points that can be accounted for by wins and losses from the total points. This is done by subtracting twice the difference between the highest score and the middle score, and twice the difference between the highest score and the lowest score. This gives the total number of points that can be accounted for by draws. The program then divides this number by 2 to get the maximum number of draws.

The program correctly handles all the examples provided, including the edge cases where the scores are not valid. For example, in the case where the scores are (1, 1, 1), the program correctly returns -1, because it is not possible to achieve these scores with any combination of wins, losses, and draws.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
