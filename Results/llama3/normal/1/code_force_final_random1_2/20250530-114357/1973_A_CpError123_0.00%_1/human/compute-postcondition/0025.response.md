Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers that must have at least 2 sublists, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order. p1, p2, p3 are the second sublist in the list, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to half of p1 + p2 + p3, egalites is equal to total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1), and total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3. If egalites is less than 0, then resultats is a list containing two elements -1 if total_matchs is greater than 3 or p3 is greater than total_matchs, otherwise resultats is a list containing two elements -1 if the sum of the second sublist (p1 + p2 + p3) is an odd number, otherwise resultats is a list containing a single element -1. If egalites is greater than or equal to 0, then resultats is a list containing either two elements -1 (if total_matchs is greater than 3 or p3 is greater than total_matchs), or an empty list (if the sum of the second sublist (p1 + p2 + p3) is an even number), or a list containing a single element -1 (if the sum of the second sublist (p1 + p2 + p3) is an odd number), or a list containing a single element equal to egalites // 2 (if the sum of the second sublist (p1 + p2 + p3) is an odd number and total_matchs is not greater than 3 and p3 is not greater than total_matchs). If total_points is odd, resultats has an additional element -1 appended to it. If total_matchs is greater than 3 or p3 is greater than total_matchs, then resultats has an additional element -1 appended to it. resultats has an additional element -1 appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of an extra -1 element appended to the resultats list.
