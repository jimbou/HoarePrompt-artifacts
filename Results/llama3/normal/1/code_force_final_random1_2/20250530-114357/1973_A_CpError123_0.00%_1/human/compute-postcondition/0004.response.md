Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers that must have at least 1 sublist, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order, resultats is a list containing a single element -1, p1, p2, p3 are the first sublist in the list, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3 and the current value of total_points is an odd number.**

The code block appends -1 to the resultats list and then skips the rest of the code in the current iteration using the continue statement. The values of t, cas_de_test, p1, p2, p3, and total_points remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The only change is the addition of -1 to the resultats list.
