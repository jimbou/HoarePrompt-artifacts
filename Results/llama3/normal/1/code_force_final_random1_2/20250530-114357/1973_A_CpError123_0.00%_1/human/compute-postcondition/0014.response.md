Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers that must have at least 1 sublist, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order. `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first sublist in the list, `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to half of `total_points` (i.e., `total_matchs` is equal to half of `p1 + p2 + p3`), `egalites` is equal to `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `egalites` is greater than or equal to 0, and `resultats` is a list containing either two elements -1 (if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`), or an empty list (if the sum of the first sublist (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is an even number), or a list containing a single element -1 (if the sum of the first sublist (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is an odd number), or a list containing a single element equal to `egalites // 2` (if the sum of the first sublist (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is an odd number and `total_matchs` is not greater than 3 and `p3` is not greater than `total_matchs`).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `resultats` list has been updated to include the value of `egalites // 2` if the sum of the first sublist is an odd number and `total_matchs` is not greater than 3 and `p3` is not greater than `total_matchs`.
