Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The program takes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program first checks if the total number of points is odd, in which case it immediately returns -1, as it is impossible to achieve an odd total number of points with the given scoring system.

Next, the program calculates the total number of matches that must have been played, which is half the total number of points. If this number is greater than 3 or if the highest score is greater than the total number of matches, the program returns -1, as it is impossible to achieve the given scores with the given number of matches.

Finally, the program calculates the number of draws that must have occurred, which is the total number of points minus twice the difference between the highest score and the second-highest score, minus twice the difference between the highest score and the lowest score. If this number is negative, the program returns -1, as it is impossible to achieve the given scores with the given number of draws. Otherwise, the program returns the number of draws divided by 2, as each draw contributes 2 points to the total number of points.

The program's logic is correct, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
