Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers that must have at least 1 sublist, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order. If total_matchs is greater than 3 or p3 is greater than total_matchs, resultats is a list containing two elements -1. Otherwise, resultats remains an empty list if the sum of the first sublist (p1 + p2 + p3) is an even number, otherwise resultats is a list containing a single element -1. p1, p2, p3 are the first sublist in the list, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, and total_matchs is equal to half of total_points (i.e., total_matchs is equal to half of p1 + p2 + p3).***
