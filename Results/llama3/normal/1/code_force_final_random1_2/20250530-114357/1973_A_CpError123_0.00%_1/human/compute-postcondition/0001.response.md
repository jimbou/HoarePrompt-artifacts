The only objects in the loop head are variables  p1, p2, p3 and list  cas_de_test, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cas_de_test.  If the list has at least 1 sublist the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer, and resultats is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 sublist and the p1, p2, p3 are the first sublist in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers that must have at least 1 sublist, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order, `resultats` is an empty list, p1, p2, p3 are the first sublist in the list**
