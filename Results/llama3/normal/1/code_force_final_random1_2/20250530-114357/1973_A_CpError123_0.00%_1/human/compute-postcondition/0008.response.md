Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers that must have at least 1 sublist, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order, resultats is a list containing two elements -1, p1, p2, p3 are the first sublist in the list, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, and total_matchs is equal to half of total_points (i.e., total_matchs is equal to half of p1 + p2 + p3).**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `resultats.append(-1)` and `continue`. The first line appends the value -1 to the list `resultats`. Since `resultats` initially contained a single element -1 if the sum of the first sublist (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is an odd number, otherwise `resultats` remains an empty list, after this line, `resultats` will contain two elements -1. The second line, `continue`, does not affect any variables.

The initial state of the variables remains the same, except for `resultats`, which now contains two elements -1. The value of `t` remains a positive integer, `cas_de_test` remains a list of lists of three integers, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` remain the first sublist in the list, `total_points` remains equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`, and `total_matchs` remains equal to half of `total_points`.
