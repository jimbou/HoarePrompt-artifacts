Output State: **t is a positive integer, cas_de_test is a list of lists of three integers that must have at least 1 sublist, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order. If total_matchs is greater than 3 or p3 is greater than total_matchs, resultats is a list containing two elements -1. Otherwise, resultats remains an empty list if the sum of the first sublist (p1 + p2 + p3) is an even number, otherwise resultats is a list containing a single element -1. p1, p2, p3 are the first sublist in the list, total_points is equal to p1 + p2 + p3, total_matchs is equal to half of total_points (i.e., total_matchs is equal to half of p1 + p2 + p3), and egalites is equal to total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1).**

In this output state, the value of egalites has been calculated based on the values of total_points, p1, p2, and p3. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of egalites is a specific combination of the values of total_points, p1, p2, and p3, which are defined in the initial state.
