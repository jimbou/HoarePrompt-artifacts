Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers that must have at least 1 sublist, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order, `resultats` is a list containing a single element -1 if the sum of the first sublist (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is an odd number, otherwise `resultats` remains an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are the first sublist in the list, and `total_points` is equal to `p1 + p2 + p3`.***
