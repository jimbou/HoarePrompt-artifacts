This function takes a list of lists of three integers, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order. It calculates the number of equalities for each sublist based on the total points and the points of each player, and returns a list of integers where each integer is either -1 (indicating an invalid input) or a non-negative integer less than or equal to 15 (representing the number of equalities). The function performs calculations for each sublist and appends the result to the output list, which is then returned.
