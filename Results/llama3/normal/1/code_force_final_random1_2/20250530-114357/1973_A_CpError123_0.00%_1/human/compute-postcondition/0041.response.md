Functionality: This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of lists `cas_de_test` as input, where each sublist contains three integers between 0 and 30 (inclusive) in non-decreasing order. It processes each sublist, calculates the total points, and checks if the total points are even. If not, it appends -1 to the result list. If the total points are even, it calculates the total matches and checks if the total matches are within a valid range (not more than 3 and not more than the third integer in the sublist). If not, it appends -1 to the result list. If the total matches are valid, it calculates the number of equalities and checks if it's non-negative. If not, it appends -1 to the result list. If the number of equalities is non-negative, it appends the number of equalities divided by 2 to the result list. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer is either -1 or a non-negative integer less than or equal to 15.
