Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists of three integers, where each integer is between 0 and 30 (inclusive), and the integers in each sublist are in non-decreasing order, `resultats` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `cas_de_test` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code initializes a new variable `resultats` and assigns it an empty list. Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `resultats` with its initial value as an empty list, in addition to the unchanged values of `t` and `cas_de_test`.
