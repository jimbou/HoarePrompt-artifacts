To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of `tc` since it's the only variable in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute if `tc` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `tc` is a positive integer representing the number of integers in the list of the first test case. This already ensures that `tc` is greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed.

State: **`tc` is a positive integer representing the number of integers in the list of the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case that has been read.**
