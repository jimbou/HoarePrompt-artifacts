To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True, `i` is 1, and 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, or 'Bob' is printed if `dp` is False**
