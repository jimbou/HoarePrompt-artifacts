Output State: **`tc` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the number of elements in the list, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between any two adjacent elements in the array is greater than 1 or if `dp` was previously False, otherwise it is False, `i` is equal to `n`, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`. If `dp` is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**

The code `tc -= 1` decrements the value of `tc` by 1. Since `tc` was initially greater than 0, it is now either greater than 0 or equal to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
