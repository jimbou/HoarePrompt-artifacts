The code prints 'Alice' if `dp` is True, otherwise it prints 'Bob'. Based on the precondition, `dp` is True if the difference between any two adjacent elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or if `dp` was previously False. Since `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, the difference between any two adjacent elements is indeed greater than 1, because the list is sorted in descending order and all elements are unique. Therefore, `dp` is True.

Output: **Alice**
