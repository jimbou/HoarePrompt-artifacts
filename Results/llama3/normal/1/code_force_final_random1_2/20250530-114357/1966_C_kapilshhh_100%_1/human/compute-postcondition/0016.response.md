Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` or False if `arr[1] - arr[2] <= 1`, `i` is 1, and 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, or 'Bob' is printed if `dp` is False**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The values of `tc`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `dp` is updated based on the difference between the first two elements of `arr`. If the difference is greater than 1, `dp` is True; otherwise, it is False. The printing of 'Alice' or 'Bob' depends on the updated value of `dp`.
