Output: **tc is greater than 0, n is the number of elements in the list, arr is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, dp is True if the difference between any two adjacent elements in the array is greater than 1 or if dp was previously False, otherwise it is False, i is equal to n, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of dp. If dp is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**
