Output State: **tc is a positive integer representing the number of integers in the list of the first test case, n is the number of unique integers in the list of the current test case minus one, arr is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, dp is True.**

Explanation: The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which represents the number of integers in the list of the current test case. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin, removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, sorts the unique integers in descending order, and appends 0 to the end of the list. The third line assigns True to `dp`. The fourth line updates `n` to be the number of unique integers in the list minus one. The value of `tc` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
