To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `tc` since it's the only variable in the loop head. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `tc` being greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is a non-negative integer, which means it could be 0, and that would prevent the loop from executing again. Therefore, `tc` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between any two adjacent elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or if `dp` was previously False, `i` is `n`, and 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, or 'Bob' is printed if `dp` is False**
