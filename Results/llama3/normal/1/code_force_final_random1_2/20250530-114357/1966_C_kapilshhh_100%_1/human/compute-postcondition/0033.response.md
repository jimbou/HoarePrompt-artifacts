Output State: **tc is greater than 0, n is the number of elements in the list, arr is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, dp is True if the difference between any two adjacent elements in the array is greater than 1 or if dp was previously False, otherwise it is False, i is equal to n.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the value of `dp` has been updated based on the differences between adjacent elements in the array. The value of `i` has reached the end of the array, and the other variables remain unchanged.
