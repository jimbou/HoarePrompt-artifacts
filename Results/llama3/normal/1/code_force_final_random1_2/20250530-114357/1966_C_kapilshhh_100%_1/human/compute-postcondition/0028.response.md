Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between the current element and the next element in the array is greater than 1, otherwise it is False, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `dp` has been updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. If the difference between the current element and the next element in the array is greater than 1, `dp` is set to True. Otherwise, it is set to False. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
