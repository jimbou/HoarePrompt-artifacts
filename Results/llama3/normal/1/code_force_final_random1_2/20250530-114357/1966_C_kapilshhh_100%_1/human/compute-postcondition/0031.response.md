The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between the current element and the next element in the array is greater than 1, otherwise it is False, `i` is 3**
