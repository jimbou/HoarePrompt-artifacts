Output State: **`tc` is 0, `n` is the number of unique integers in the input list, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` (excluding the last element 0) such that their difference is greater than 1, or False otherwise, `i` is equal to `n`, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `tc` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `n` will hold the number of unique integers in the input list, and `arr` will be a sorted list of these unique integers in descending order, with an additional element 0 at the end. The variable `dp` will be True if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` (excluding the last element 0) such that their difference is greater than 1, or False otherwise. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' will be printed depending on the value of `dp`.
