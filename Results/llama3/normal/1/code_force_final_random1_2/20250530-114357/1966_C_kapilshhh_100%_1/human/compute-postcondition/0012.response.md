Output State: **`tc` is a non-negative integer, `n` is at least 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between any two adjacent elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or if `dp` was previously False, `i` is `n`, and 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, or 'Bob' is printed if `dp` is False**

The code decrements the value of `tc` by 1. Since `tc` is initially a positive integer, after the decrement operation, it becomes a non-negative integer (it can be 0 if it was initially 1). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
