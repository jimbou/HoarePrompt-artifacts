The code `tc = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tc`. Since the initial state contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers, the integer assigned to `tc` is a positive integer and represents the number of integers in the list of the first test case. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case that has been read. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer representing the number of integers in the list of the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case that has been read.**
