Output: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is the number of unique integers in the input list, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` (excluding the last element 0) such that their difference is greater than 1, or False otherwise, `i` is equal to 0, and 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, or 'Bob' is printed if `dp` is False, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`**
