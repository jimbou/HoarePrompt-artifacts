Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between the current element and the next element in the array is greater than 1 or if `dp` was previously False, otherwise it is False, `i` is 3**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial properties, but the value of `dp` is updated based on the difference between the current element and the next element in the array, and the previous value of `dp`.
