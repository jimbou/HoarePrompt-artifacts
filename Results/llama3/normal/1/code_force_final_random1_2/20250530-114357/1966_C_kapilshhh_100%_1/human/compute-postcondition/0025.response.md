To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `tc` since it's the only variable in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `tc` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is greater than or equal to 0. To guarantee the loop can execute again, `tc` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is the number of unique integers in the input list, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` (excluding the last element 0) such that their difference is greater than 1, or False otherwise, `i` is equal to 0, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`**
