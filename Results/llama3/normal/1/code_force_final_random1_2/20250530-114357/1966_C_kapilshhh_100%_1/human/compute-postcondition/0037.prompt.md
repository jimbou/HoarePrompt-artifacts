Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tc` is a positive integer representing the number of integers in the list of the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case that has been read.
Code of the loop:
while tc > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True
        ) + [0]
    dp = True
    n = len(arr) - 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp
    print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
    tc -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is a non-negative integer, `n` is at least 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between any two adjacent elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or if `dp` was previously False, `i` is `n`, and 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, or 'Bob' is printed if `dp` is False
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `tc` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the number of unique integers in the input list, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` (excluding the last element 0) such that their difference is greater than 1, or False otherwise, `i` is equal to 0, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `tc` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the number of elements in the list, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between any two adjacent elements in the array is greater than 1 or if `dp` was previously False, otherwise it is False, `i` is equal to `n`, and either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed depending on the value of `dp`. If `dp` is True, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
