State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or False if `arr[2] - arr[3] <= 1` or `dp` is False if `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` or True if `arr[1] - arr[2] <= 1`, `i` is 3**
