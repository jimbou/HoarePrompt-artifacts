Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) followed by a list of positive integers. It removes duplicates from the list, sorts the unique integers in descending order, and appends a 0 to the end. Then, it checks if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements (excluding the last element 0) with a difference greater than 1. Based on this condition, it prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case. The function continues processing test cases until all input has been consumed.**
