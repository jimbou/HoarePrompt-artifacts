Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between any two adjacent elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or if `dp` was previously False, `i` is `n`**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `tc` remains a positive integer, `n` remains at least 1, and `arr` remains a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end. The variable `dp` will be True if the difference between any two adjacent elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or if `dp` was previously False. The loop counter `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
