Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tc is greater than 0, n is the number of unique integers in the input list, arr is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, dp is True, i is equal to the number of unique integers in the input list, and 'Alice' is printed if dp is True, or 'Bob' is printed if dp is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` or False if `arr[1] - arr[2] <= 1`, `i` is 1, and 'Alice' is printed if `dp` is True, or 'Bob' is printed if `dp` is False

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tc` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or False if `arr[2] - arr[3] <= 1` or `dp` is False if `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` or True if `arr[1] - arr[2] <= 1`, `i` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tc` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1` or False if `arr[3] - arr[4] <= 1` or `dp` is False if `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` or True if `arr[1] - arr[2] <= 1`, `i` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
