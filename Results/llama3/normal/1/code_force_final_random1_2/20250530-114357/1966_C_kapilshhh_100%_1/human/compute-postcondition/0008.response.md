Output State: **`tc` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 1, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if the difference between the third and fourth elements of `arr` is greater than 1 or if `dp` was previously False, `i` is 3**

The value of `dp` is updated based on the difference between the third and fourth elements of `arr`. If the difference is greater than 1, `dp` becomes True. If the difference is not greater than 1, `dp` becomes the opposite of its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
