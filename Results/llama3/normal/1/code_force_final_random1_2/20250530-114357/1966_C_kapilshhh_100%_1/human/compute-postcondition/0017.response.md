To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head variables, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, it must also be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`tc`, `arr`, and `dp`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`tc` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the list of the current test case in descending order with an additional element 0 at the end, `dp` is True if `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1` or False if `arr[1] - arr[2] <= 1`, `i` is 2**
