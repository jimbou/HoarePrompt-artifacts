To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The objects in the loop head are `_` and `stdin`. The state of `_` is not relevant to the loop condition, as it is just a throwaway variable. The state of `stdin` is what matters, as the loop will execute as long as there are more test cases to read from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least one more test case. Therefore, the state of `stdin` needs to be adjusted to contain `t-2` test cases.

The other variables, such as `n`, `ar`, `res`, `mex`, and `i`, are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop condition. Their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where each value is `mex` - `ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i`, `mex` is at least 0 and is the minimum value of `mex` - `ar[i]` for all `i`, `i` is -1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**
