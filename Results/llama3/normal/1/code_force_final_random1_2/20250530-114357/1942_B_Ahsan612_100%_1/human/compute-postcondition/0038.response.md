To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `ar`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `ar` has at least 1 element. Since `ar` is a list of `n` integers, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 1.

State: **_ is 1, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` None values, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases**
