Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and None, `mex` is the minimum value between the current value of `mex` and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `res[i]` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, where `i` is `len(ar) - 2`. The value of `mex` has also been updated to the minimum value between its current value and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
