Output: **_ is 1, n is an integer, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where res[i] is mex - ar[i], mex is the minimum value between the current value of mex and mex - ar[i] for all i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1), i is -1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and this is printed: a string of space-separated integers representing the values in the res list**
