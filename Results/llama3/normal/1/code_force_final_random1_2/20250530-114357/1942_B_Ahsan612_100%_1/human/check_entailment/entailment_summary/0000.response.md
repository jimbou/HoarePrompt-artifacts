Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input from stdin, which includes the number of test cases, the length of the permutation `n`, and the array `a`.
2.  It initializes an empty list `res` of size `n` to store the constructed permutation `p`.
3.  The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order, starting from the last element. For each element `a_i`, it calculates the corresponding element `p_i` in the permutation `p` using the formula `p_i = mex - a_i`, where `mex` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` up to index `i`.
4.  The program updates the `mex` value by taking the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p_i`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` up to the current index.
5.  Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `p` as a string of space-separated integers.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes the input correctly, calculates the permutation `p` based on the array `a`, and prints the result as expected.

Correctness: **True**
