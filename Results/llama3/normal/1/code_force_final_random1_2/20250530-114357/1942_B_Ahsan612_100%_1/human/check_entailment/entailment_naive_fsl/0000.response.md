Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The key insight is to start from the end of the array and work backwards, maintaining the minimum non-negative integer `mex` that does not appear in the constructed permutation.

The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the maximum possible value. Then, for each element `a_i` in the array, it calculates the corresponding element `p_i` in the permutation as `mex - a_i`. If `mex` is greater than `mex - a_i`, it updates `mex` to `mex - a_i`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the constructed permutation.

The program correctly handles the case where `a_i` is negative, as it simply subtracts `a_i` from `mex` to get `p_i`. This is because the problem statement guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists, so the program can safely assume that `mex - a_i` will always be a valid index.

The program also correctly handles the case where `a_i` is equal to `mex`, as it simply sets `p_i` to `mex - a_i`, which is equal to `mex`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
