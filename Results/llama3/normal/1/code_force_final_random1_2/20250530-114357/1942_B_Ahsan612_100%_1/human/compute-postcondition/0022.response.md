Postcondition: ***_ is 0, n is an integer, ar is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, res is a list of n values where the last value is mex - ar[i], mex is n, i is len(ar) - 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. The current value of mex is greater than the difference between mex and the last element of ar.***
