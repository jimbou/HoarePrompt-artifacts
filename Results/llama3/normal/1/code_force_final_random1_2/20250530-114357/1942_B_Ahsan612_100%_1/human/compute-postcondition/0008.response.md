Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of `n` values where the last two values are `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and the rest are `None`, `mex` is at least 0, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, and `mex` is either equal to `mex - ar[i]` or remains unchanged**

In this output state, the value of `res[i]` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, which is the difference between the current value of `mex` and the value of `ar` at index `i`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Note that `mex` may have changed its value to `mex - ar[i]` or remained the same, depending on its previous value.
