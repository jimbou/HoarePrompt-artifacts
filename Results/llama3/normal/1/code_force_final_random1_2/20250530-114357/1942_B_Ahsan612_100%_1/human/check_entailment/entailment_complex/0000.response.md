Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation p that satisfies the given array a. The program uses a simple and efficient approach to calculate the values of p by iterating over the array a in reverse order and keeping track of the minimum value (mex) that has not been used yet.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the input array a contains negative values or when the value of mex is updated. The use of the `None` value to initialize the result list res is also correct, as it allows the program to correctly handle the case where the input array a is empty.

The program's output format is also correct, as it prints the resulting list of values as a string of space-separated integers.

Overall, the program is well-structured, efficient, and correct.

Correctness: **True**
