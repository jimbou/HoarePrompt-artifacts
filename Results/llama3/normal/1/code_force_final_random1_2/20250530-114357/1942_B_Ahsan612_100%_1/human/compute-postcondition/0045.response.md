Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and None, `mex` is the minimum value between the current value of `mex` and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, and `mex` is updated to be `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `_` remains 1, `n` is still at least 1, and `ar` is still a list of `n` integers. The list `res` still contains `n` values, where the value at index `i` is the difference between the updated `mex` and the value at index `i` in `ar`, and the rest of the values are either the difference between the updated `mex` and the second last value in `ar` or None. The value of `mex` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and the difference between its current value and the second last value in `ar`. The value of `i` remains `len(ar) - 2`. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-5`.
