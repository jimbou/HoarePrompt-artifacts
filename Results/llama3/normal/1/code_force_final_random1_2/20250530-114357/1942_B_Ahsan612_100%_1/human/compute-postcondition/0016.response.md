The code prints a string of space-separated values, where each value is the difference between the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` (denoted as `mex`) and the corresponding element `ar[i]` in the list `ar`. The list `res` contains these differences for each index `i`.

Since the exact values of `mex` and the elements in `ar` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the differences. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated differences.

Output: **space-separated values of mex - ar[i] for each i (where mex is the minimum value of mex - ar[i] for all i and ar[i] are the elements of the list ar)**
