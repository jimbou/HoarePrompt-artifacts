Output State: **_ is 0, n is at least 1, ar is a list of at least 1 integer, res is a list of n values where the last value is mex - ar[len(ar) - 1] and the rest are None, mex is at least 0, i is len(ar) - 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the current value of mex is equal to mex - ar[i].**

In this output state, the value of mex has been updated to be equal to mex - ar[i], which means it is now less than or equal to the previous value of mex. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of mex is now at least 0, since it is possible that mex - ar[i] equals 0. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
