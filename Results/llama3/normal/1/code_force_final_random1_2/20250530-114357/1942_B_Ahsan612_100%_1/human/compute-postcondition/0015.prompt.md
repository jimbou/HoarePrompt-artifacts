Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: \_ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is at least 1, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n None values, mex is at least 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    res[i] = mex - ar[i]
    if mex > mex - ar[i]:
        mex = mex - ar[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_ is 0, n is at least 1, ar is a list of at least 1 integer, res is a list of n values where the last value is mex - ar[len(ar) - 1] and the rest are None, mex is at least 0, i is len(ar) - 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and mex is either equal to mex - ar[i] or remains unchanged

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *_ is 0, n is at least 1, ar is a list of at least 1 integer, res is a list of n values where the last two values are mex - ar[len(ar) - 2] and mex - ar[len(ar) - 2] and the rest are None, mex is at least 0 and is either equal to mex - ar[len(ar) - 2] or remains unchanged, i is len(ar) - 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If mex > mex - ar[i], mex is either equal to mex - ar[len(ar) - 2] or remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *_ is 0, n is at least 2, ar is a list of at least 2 integers, res is a list of n values where the last three values are mex - ar[len(ar) - 3], mex - ar[len(ar) - 2], mex - ar[len(ar) - 2] and mex - ar[len(ar) - 3] and the rest are None, mex is at least 0 and is either equal to mex - ar[len(ar) - 3] if mex > mex - ar[i], otherwise mex remains unchanged, i is len(ar) - 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
