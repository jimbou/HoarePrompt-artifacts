Output State: **_* is 0, n is at least 2, ar is a list of at least 2 integers, res is a list of n values where the last three values are mex - ar[len(ar) - 3], mex - ar[len(ar) - 2], mex - ar[len(ar) - 2] and mex - ar[len(ar) - 3] and the rest are None, mex is at least 0 and is either equal to mex - ar[len(ar) - 3] or remains unchanged, i is len(ar) - 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of res[i] has been updated to mex - ar[i], where i is len(ar) - 3. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of mex is still at least 0 and is either equal to mex - ar[len(ar) - 3] or remains unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
