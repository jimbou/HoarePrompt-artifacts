The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `len(ar) - 3`. Since `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `len(ar)` must be at least 2 for `i` to be `len(ar) - 3`. Also, since `res` is a list of `n` values where the last two values are `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `n` must be at least 2 for `res` to have at least two values.

State: **_* is 0, n is at least 2, ar is a list of at least 2 integers, res is a list of n values where the last three values are mex - ar[len(ar) - 3], mex - ar[len(ar) - 2], and mex - ar[len(ar) - 2] and the rest are None, mex is at least 0 and is either equal to mex - ar[len(ar) - 3] or remains unchanged, i is len(ar) - 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
