The value of `res[i]` is assigned the value `mex - ar[i]`. The value of `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, so `res` is a list of n values where the last value is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]` and the rest are None. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains t-1 test cases. Therefore, the Output State is: `_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of n values where the last value is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]` and the rest are None, `mex` is at least 1, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
