Output State: **_ is 0, n is an integer, ar is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, res is a list of n values where the last value is mex - ar[i], mex is n, i is len(ar) - 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `res[i]` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, where `mex` is `n` and `i` is the last index of the list `ar`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
