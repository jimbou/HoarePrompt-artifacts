Postcondition: ***_ is 0, n is at least 1, ar is a list of at least 1 integer, res is a list of n values where the last two values are mex - ar[len(ar) - 2] and mex - ar[len(ar) - 2] and the rest are None, mex is at least 0 and is either equal to mex - ar[len(ar) - 2] or remains unchanged, i is len(ar) - 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If mex > mex - ar[i], mex is either equal to mex - ar[len(ar) - 2] or remains unchanged.***
