To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `_` is 1
* `n` is at least 1
* `ar` is a list of `n` integers
* `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `None`
* `mex` is the minimum value between the current value of `mex` and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`
* `i` is `len(ar) - 2`
* `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases

Since the loop iterates in reverse order, the next value of `i` should be `len(ar) - 3` for the loop to execute again. The other variables in the loop head are not directly affected by the loop iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`_` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `None`, `mex` is the minimum value between the current value of `mex` and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases**
