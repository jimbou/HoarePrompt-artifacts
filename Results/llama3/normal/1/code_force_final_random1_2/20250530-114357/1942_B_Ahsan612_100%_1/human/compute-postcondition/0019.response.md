Output State: **_ is 0, n is an integer, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n None values, mex is n, i is -1, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `n` is updated to an integer value read from the input, which is at least 1. The list `ar` is updated to contain `n` integers read from the input. The list `res` is initialized with `n` None values. The value of `mex` is set to `n`, which is at least 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at -1. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 2, leaving `t-3` test cases.
