Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of `n` values where the last two values are mex - ar[i] and mex - ar[i+1], `mex` is either `n` or mex - ar[i] depending on whether mex > mex - ar[i] or not, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `res[i]` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, where `i` is the second last index of the list `ar`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The list `res` now has the last two values as `mex - ar[i]` and `mex - ar[i+1]`, where `i` is the second last index of the list `ar`. The value of `mex` is still either `n` or `mex - ar[i]` depending on whether `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]` or not. The value of `i` is still `len(ar) - 2`. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
