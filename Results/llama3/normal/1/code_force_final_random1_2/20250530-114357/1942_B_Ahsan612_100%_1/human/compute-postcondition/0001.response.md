The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the standard input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then initializes a list `res` of size `n` with all elements set to `None`, and sets the variable `mex` to `n`.

Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

*   The first line reads an integer `n` from the standard input, which is at least 1. This reduces the number of inputs in stdin by 1.
*   The second line reads a list of `n` integers from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `ar`. This reduces the number of inputs in stdin by `n`.
*   The third line initializes a list `res` of size `n` with all elements set to `None`. This does not affect any other variables.
*   The fourth line sets the variable `mex` to `n`. This does not affect any other variables.

After the entire code block has been executed, the output state is:

Output State: **\_ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is at least 1, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n None values, mex is at least 1**
