Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the results. It accepts a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. The function calculates a new list of values, where each value is the difference between the minimum value (mex) and the corresponding value in the input list. The function then prints the resulting list of values as a string of space-separated integers. The function repeats this process for each test case until all test cases have been processed, at which point stdin is empty.**
