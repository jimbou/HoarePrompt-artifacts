To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `ar`. The loop will execute again if `i` is greater than -1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, which means the loop has processed the last element of the list `ar`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(ar) - 2`.

The state of `ar` remains unchanged, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, such as `n`, `res`, `mex`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of `n` values where the last value is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and the rest are `None`, `mex` is at least 0, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, and `mex` is either equal to `mex - ar[i]` or remains unchanged**
