Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, and the current value of `mex` is less than or equal to the current value of `mex - ar[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `mex` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, which means it has decreased by the value of `ar[i]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `mex` is greater than the current value of `mex - ar[i]` is no longer true, and instead, the current value of `mex` is less than or equal to the current value of `mex - ar[i]`.
