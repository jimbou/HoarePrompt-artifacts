Postcondition: ***_ is 1, n is at least 1, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where res[i] is mex - ar[i] and the rest are mex - ar[len(ar) - 2] and None, mex is the minimum value between the current value of mex and mex - ar[len(ar) - 2], i is len(ar) - 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases. If mex is greater than mex - ar[i], mex is updated to be mex - ar[len(ar) - 2].***
