Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of `n` values where the last two values are `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and the rest are `None`, `mex` is at least 0 and is either equal to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` or remains unchanged, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `mex` has been updated to be either equal to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` or remains unchanged, depending on the previous value of `mex` and the value of `ar[len(ar) - 2]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
