The code prints a string of space-separated values, where each value is the difference between the minimum value in the list of differences between the mex value and each element in the list `ar`, and each element in the list `ar`. The mex value is the minimum value in the list of differences between the mex value and each element in the list `ar`. The list `res` contains these differences for each element in the list `ar`.

Output: **[mex - ar[0], mex - ar[1], ..., mex - ar[n-1]] (where mex is the minimum value in the list of mex - ar[i] values and n is the number of elements in the list ar)**
