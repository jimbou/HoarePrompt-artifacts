Output State: **_ is 1, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `res[i]` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, where `i` is the last index of the list `ar`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res[i]` is now a specific integer value, which is the difference between `mex` (which is `n`) and the value of `ar[i]`. The rest of the values in the `res` list are still None.
