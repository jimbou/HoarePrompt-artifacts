Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = [None] * n
    mex = n
    for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
        res[i] = mex - ar[i]
        if mex > mex - ar[i]:
            mex = mex - ar[i]
    print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 0, n is at least 1, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where each value is mex - ar[i] for the corresponding index i, mex is at least 0 and is the minimum value of mex - ar[i] for all i, i is -1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the list of values in res is printed as a string of space-separated integers, where each value is mex - ar[i] for the corresponding index i

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 0, n is an integer, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where each value is mex - ar[i], mex is the minimum value in the list of mex - ar[i] values, i is -1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and this is printed: A string of n space-separated integers, where each integer is the difference between the minimum value in the list of mex - ar[i] values and the corresponding element in the list ar.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 1, n is an integer, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where res[i] is mex - ar[i], mex is the minimum value between the current value of mex and mex - ar[i] for all i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1), i is -1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and this is printed: a string of space-separated integers representing the values in the res list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
