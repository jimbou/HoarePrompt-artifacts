Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of `n` values where the last three values are mex - ar[i], mex - ar[i+1], and mex - ar[i+2], `mex` is either `n` or mex - ar[i] depending on whether mex > mex - ar[i] or not, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `res[i]` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, where `i` is `len(ar) - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `res` now has its last three values updated to `mex - ar[i]`, `mex - ar[i+1]`, and `mex - ar[i+2]`. The value of `mex` is still dependent on whether `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]` or not. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
