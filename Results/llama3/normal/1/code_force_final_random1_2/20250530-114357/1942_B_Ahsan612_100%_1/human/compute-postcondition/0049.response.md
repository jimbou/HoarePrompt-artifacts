Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `res[len(ar) - 1]` is `None`, `mex` is the minimum value between the current value of `mex` and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `_` remains 1, the value of `n` is still at least 1, the list `ar` remains unchanged, the list `res` remains unchanged except for the fact that `res[len(ar) - 2]` is now `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, the value of `mex` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, the value of `i` is still `len(ar) - 3`, and there are still `t-5` test cases in the standard input.
