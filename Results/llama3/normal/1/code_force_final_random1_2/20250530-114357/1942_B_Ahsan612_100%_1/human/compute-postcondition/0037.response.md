Output State: **_ is 1, n is an integer, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n None values, mex is n, i is -1, stdin contains t-5 test cases**

The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`, overwriting its previous value. It then reads a list of `n` integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `ar`, replacing its previous value. The variable `res` is initialized as a list of `n` None values. The variable `mex` is assigned the value of `n`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at -1. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin now contains t-5 test cases.
