Output State: **_* is 0, n is at least 2, ar is a list of at least 2 integers, res is a list of n values where the last three values are mex - ar[len(ar) - 3], mex - ar[len(ar) - 2], mex - ar[len(ar) - 2] and mex - ar[len(ar) - 3] and the rest are None, mex is at least 0 and is equal to mex - ar[len(ar) - 3], i is len(ar) - 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of mex is updated to be equal to mex - ar[len(ar) - 3], which means mex is now equal to the difference between its original value and the third last element of the list ar. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
