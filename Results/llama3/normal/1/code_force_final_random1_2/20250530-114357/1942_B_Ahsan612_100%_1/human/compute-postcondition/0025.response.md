To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from `len(ar) - 1` down to `-1` with a step of `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1.

The only other object in the loop head is `ar`, which is a list of `n` integers. However, the state of `ar` does not need to be adjusted, as the loop is iterating over the indices of `ar`, not modifying `ar` itself.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be decremented by 1.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of `n` values where the last value is mex - ar[i], `mex` is either `n` or mex - ar[i] depending on whether mex > mex - ar[i] or not, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**
