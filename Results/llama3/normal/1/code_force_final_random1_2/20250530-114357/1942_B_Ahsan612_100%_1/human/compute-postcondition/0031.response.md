Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of `n` values where the last three values are mex - ar[i], mex - ar[i+1], and mex - ar[i+2], `mex` is either `n` or mex - ar[i] depending on whether mex > mex - ar[i] or not, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `mex` is now equal to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `_` remains 0, `n` is still an integer, `ar` is still a list of `n` integers with at least one integer, `res` is still a list of `n` values with the last three values being the difference between `mex` and the corresponding elements in `ar`. The value of `mex` has been updated to be the difference between its previous value and the element at index `len(ar) - 3` in `ar`. The value of `i` remains `len(ar) - 3`, and there are still `t-3` test cases left in `stdin`.
