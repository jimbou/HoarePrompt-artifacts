Output State: **_ is t-1, n is an integer, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where res[i] is mex - ar[i], mex is the minimum value between the current value of mex and mex - ar[i] for all i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1), i is -1, stdin contains 0 test cases, and this is printed: a string of space-separated integers representing the values in the res list**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `_` has reached its final value of `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The variables `n` and `ar` still hold their respective values, and the list `res` contains the final values calculated by the loop. The variable `mex` has been updated to its minimum value based on the calculations performed in the loop. The variable `i` is still at its final value of `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. The input stream `stdin` is now empty, as all test cases have been processed. Finally, the output is a string of space-separated integers representing the values in the `res` list, which is the result of the loop's calculations.
