Output State: **_ is 0, n is at least 1, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where each value is mex - ar[i] for the corresponding index i, mex is at least 0 and is the minimum value of mex - ar[i] for all i, i is -1, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the output state is such that:

* The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
* The value of `n` remains unchanged, indicating the length of the input list `ar`.
* The input list `ar` remains unchanged.
* The output list `res` now contains the result of the calculation `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` in the input list `ar`.
* The value of `mex` is updated to be the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all indices `i` in the input list `ar`. If `mex` was already the minimum value, it remains unchanged.
* The loop counter `i` has reached -1, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
* The input from `stdin` remains unchanged, containing `t-1` test cases.
