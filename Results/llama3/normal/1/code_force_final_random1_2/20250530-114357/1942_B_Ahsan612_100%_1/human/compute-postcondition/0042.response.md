Postcondition: ***_ is 1, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` and the rest are None, `mex` is the minimum value between the current value of `mex` and `mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases.***
