To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from the second last element of the list `ar` to the first element, decrementing the index `i` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(ar) - 3`.

The other objects in the loop head are `ar` and `len(ar)`. Since `ar` is a list of `n` integers, its length is fixed and cannot be changed. Therefore, we cannot adjust the state of `ar`.

The state of `n` is not directly related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust its state.

The states of `_`, `res`, `mex`, and `stdin` are not related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which becomes `len(ar) - 3`.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of `n` values where the last two values are mex - ar[i] and mex - ar[i+1], `mex` is either `n` or mex - ar[i] depending on whether mex > mex - ar[i] or not, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases**
