Output State: **_ is 0, n is an integer, ar is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, res is a list of n values where the last value is mex - ar[i], mex is mex - ar[i], i is len(ar) - 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

The value of mex is updated to be the difference between its current value and the last element of ar. The current value of mex is greater than the difference between mex and the last element of ar, so the new value of mex is less than its current value. The values of the other variables are not affected.
