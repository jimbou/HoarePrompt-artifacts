Output State: **_ is 1, n is an integer, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where res[i] is mex - ar[i], mex is the minimum value between the current value of mex and mex - ar[i] for all i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1), i is -1, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `_` remains unchanged at 1, `n` remains an integer, `ar` remains a list of `n` integers, `res` becomes a list of `n` values where each value is the difference between the minimum value `mex` and the corresponding value in `ar`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum value between the current value of `mex` and the difference between `mex` and each value in `ar` in reverse order, `i` is reset to -1, and `stdin` still contains `t-5` test cases.
