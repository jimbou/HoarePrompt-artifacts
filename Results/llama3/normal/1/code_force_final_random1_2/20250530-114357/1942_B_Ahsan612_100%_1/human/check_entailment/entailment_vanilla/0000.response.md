Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, which involves constructing a permutation `p` based on an array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, where `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes an array `res` of length `n` to store the constructed permutation `p`.
4. It initializes a variable `mex` to `n`, which will keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
5. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
6. For each element `a_i` in `a`, it calculates the corresponding element `p_i` in the permutation `p` using the formula `p_i = mex - a_i`.
7. It updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p_i`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation.
8. Finally, it prints the constructed permutation `p` as a space-separated string.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. The use of a deque is not necessary in this case, as the program only needs to iterate over the array `a` in reverse order, which can be done using a simple loop.

Correctness: **True**
