To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `ar`. The loop will execute if `ar` has at least one element, since the range starts from `len(ar) - 1` and goes down to `-1`. 

State: **_ is 0, n is an integer, ar is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, res is a list of n None values, mex is n, i is len(ar) - 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases**
