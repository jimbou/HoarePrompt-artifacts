Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of `n` values where the last two values are mex - ar[i] and mex - ar[i+1], `mex` is mex - ar[i], `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `mex` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, where `i` is the second last index of the list `ar`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
