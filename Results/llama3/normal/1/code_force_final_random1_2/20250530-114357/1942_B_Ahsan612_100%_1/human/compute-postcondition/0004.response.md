Postcondition: **_ is 0, n is at least 1, ar is a list of at least 1 integer, res is a list of n values where the last value is mex - ar[len(ar) - 1] and the rest are None, mex is at least 1, i is len(ar) - 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the current value of mex is greater than mex - ar[i].**
