Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `ar` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of `n` values where the last two values are mex - ar[i] and mex - ar[i+1], `mex` is either `n` or mex - ar[i] depending on whether mex > mex - ar[i] or not, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases***
