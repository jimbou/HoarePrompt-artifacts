Let's analyze the loop head:

`for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):`

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `ar` and `i`.

According to the code, the loop will iterate from the last element of `ar` to the first element. Therefore, we can conclude that:

* `ar` must have at least one element (since we're iterating from the last element to the first).
* `i` will start at the index of the last element of `ar` (i.e., `len(ar) - 1`).

The other variables (`_`, `stdin`, `n`, `res`, and `mex`) are not directly related to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust their states.

State: **`_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of at least 1 integer, `res` is a list of n None values, `mex` is at least 1, `i` is `len(ar) - 1**
