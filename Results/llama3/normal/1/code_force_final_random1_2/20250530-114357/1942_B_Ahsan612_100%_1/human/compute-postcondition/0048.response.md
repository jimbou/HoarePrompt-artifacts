Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `res[len(ar) - 1]` is `None`, `mex` is the minimum value between the current value of `mex` and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `res[i]` has been updated to `mex - ar[i]`, where `i` is `len(ar) - 3`. The rest of the values in the `res` list remain the same, with `res[len(ar) - 2]` being `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]` and `res[len(ar) - 1]` being `None`. The value of `mex` is also updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`. The other variables, including `_`, `n`, `ar`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
