Output State: **_ is 0, n is an integer, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where each value is mex - ar[i], mex is the minimum value in the list of mex - ar[i] values, i is -1, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the list `res` will contain the differences between the initial value of `mex` (which is `n`) and each element in the list `ar`. The value of `mex` will be updated to the minimum value among these differences. The loop counter `i` will be reset to -1, and the other variables `_`, `n`, `ar`, and `stdin` will remain unchanged.
