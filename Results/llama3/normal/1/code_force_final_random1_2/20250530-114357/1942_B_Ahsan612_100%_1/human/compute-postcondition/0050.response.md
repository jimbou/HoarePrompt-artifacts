Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `ar` is a list of `n` integers, `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `res[len(ar) - 1]` is `None`. If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is the minimum value between the current value of `mex` and `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, otherwise `mex` remains unchanged. `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases.***
