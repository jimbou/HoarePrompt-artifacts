The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and this is printed: A string of n space-separated integers, where each integer is the difference between the minimum value in the list of mex - ar[i] values and the corresponding element in the list ar. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ is 1 and stdin contains t-4 test cases.
State: **_ is 1, n is an integer, ar is a list of n integers, res is a list of n values where each value is mex - ar[i], mex is the minimum value in the list of mex - ar[i] values, i is -1, stdin contains t-4 test cases, and this is printed: A string of n space-separated integers, where each integer is the difference between the minimum value in the list of mex - ar[i] values and the corresponding element in the list ar.**
