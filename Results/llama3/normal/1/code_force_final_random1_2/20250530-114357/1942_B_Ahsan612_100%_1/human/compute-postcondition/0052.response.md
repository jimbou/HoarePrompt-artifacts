Based on the precondition, let's break down the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `_` is 1 (not used in the print statement)
* `n` is an integer (not used in the print statement)
* `ar` is a list of `n` integers
* `res` is a list of `n` values where `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`
* `mex` is the minimum value between the current value of `mex` and `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in range(`len(ar) - 1, -1, -1`)
* `i` is -1 (not used in the print statement)
* `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases (not used in the print statement)

The print statement uses a generator expression to convert each element `x` in the `res` list to a string and joins them with spaces using the `' '.join()` method.

Since `res` is a list of `n` values where each value is `mex - ar[i]`, the print statement will output a string of `n` space-separated integers, where each integer is the difference between the minimum value `mex` and the corresponding element `ar[i]` in the `ar` list.

Output: **a string of n space-separated integers, where each integer is the difference between the minimum value mex and the corresponding element ar[i] in the ar list**
