Output State: **dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is 7, dp[4] is 25, dp[5] is 157, dp[6] is 577, dp[7] is 2081, dp[8] is 7425, dp[9] is 26317, dp[10] is 93457, n is greater than or equal to 10, i is 10**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the dp array has been populated up to index 10, with the values of dp[1] and dp[2] remaining unchanged, and the values of dp[3] to dp[10] being calculated based on the recurrence relation in the loop. The value of n is greater than or equal to 10, indicating that the loop has executed at least 10 times. The value of i is 10, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
