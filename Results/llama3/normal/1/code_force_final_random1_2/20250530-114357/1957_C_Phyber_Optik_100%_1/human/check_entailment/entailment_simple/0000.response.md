Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The dynamic programming approach used in the program is correct, and the base cases are properly handled. The program also correctly handles the case when n is 1 or 2, and it correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations for larger values of n.

The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations. It first initializes the dp array with -1, and then it calculates the number of possible final configurations for each value of n from 1 to 300000. The program uses the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007 to calculate the number of possible final configurations for each value of n.

The program also correctly handles the case when n is 1 or 2. When n is 1, there is only one possible final configuration, and when n is 2, there are three possible final configurations.

The program then reads the input and calculates the number of possible final configurations for each test case. It correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations by subtracting the number of invalid moves from n and using the dp array to look up the number of possible final configurations for the remaining valid moves.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
