Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `dp[5]` is 157, `n` is greater than 5, `i` is 5**

In this output state, the value of `dp[5]` is calculated using the given formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Since `i` is 5, `dp[5]` is calculated as `(dp[4] + 2 * 4 * dp[3]) % 1000000007`, which equals `(25 + 2 * 4 * 7) % 1000000007`, resulting in 157. The values of `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, `dp[3]`, `dp[4]`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
