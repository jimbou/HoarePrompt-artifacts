Reasoning:

The problem is asking us to determine the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on an n x n chessboard, given that k moves have already been played. The program provided is attempting to solve this problem.

The program first initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size 300007, where `dp[i]` represents the number of different final configurations possible for an i x i chessboard. The `func_1` function is used to populate this array.

The `func_1` function calculates the values of `dp[i]` for i ranging from 1 to n. The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, which represent the number of different final configurations possible for a 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 chessboard, respectively.

For i greater than 2, the function calculates `dp[i]` as `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This formula is based on the fact that for an i x i chessboard, we can either place a white rook in the first row and a black rook in the first column (which gives us `dp[i - 1]` possibilities), or we can place a white rook in the first row and a black rook in any of the remaining i - 1 columns (which gives us `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` possibilities).

The main part of the program reads the input, which consists of the number of test cases t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of the size of the chessboard n and the number of moves already played k, followed by k pairs of integers representing the moves.

For each test case, the program calculates the number of invalid moves (i.e., moves that would result in two rooks attacking each other) and stores them in a set `invalid`. It then prints the maximum of 1 and `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which represents the number of different final configurations possible for the given chessboard and number of moves.

Based on the provided problem description and the program, the reasoning is as follows:

* The program correctly initializes the `dp` array and calculates the values of `dp[i]` for i ranging from 1 to n.
* The program correctly reads the input and calculates the number of invalid moves for each test case.
* The program correctly prints the maximum of 1 and `dp[n - len(invalid)]` for each test case, which represents the number of different final configurations possible for the given chessboard and number of moves.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
