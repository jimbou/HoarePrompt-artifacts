To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.

The code is:
```
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
```
The initial state is:
```
dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, n must be greater than 2, i is 3
```
Now, let's calculate the output state:

Since `i` is 3, we need to calculate `dp[3]`.

`dp[3]` is assigned the value of `(dp[2] + 2 * (3 - 1) * dp[1]) % 1000000007`.

We know that `dp[2]` is 3 and `dp[1]` is 1. So, we can substitute these values:

`dp[3]` = `(3 + 2 * 2 * 1) % 1000000007`

`dp[3]` = `(3 + 4) % 1000000007`

`dp[3]` = `7 % 1000000007`

`dp[3]` = 7

So, the output state is:
```
dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is 7, n must be greater than 2, i is 3
```
In natural language, the output state is: The value of `dp[3]` is calculated and assigned to be 7, while the values of `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is 7, n must be greater than 2, i is 3**
