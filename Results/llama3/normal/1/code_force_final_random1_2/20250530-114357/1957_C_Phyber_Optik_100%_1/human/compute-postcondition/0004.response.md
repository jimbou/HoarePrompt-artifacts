Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `dp[i]` is assigned a new value based on the values of `dp[i-1]`, `dp[i-2]`, and `i`.
2. Since `i` is 4, we need to calculate `dp[4]`.
3. `dp[4]` is calculated as `(dp[3] + 2 * (4 - 1) * dp[2]) % 1000000007`.
4. We know that `dp[3]` is 7 and `dp[2]` is 3.
5. Substituting these values, we get `dp[4] = (7 + 2 * 3 * 3) % 1000000007`.
6. Evaluating the expression, we get `dp[4] = (7 + 18) % 1000000007 = 25 % 1000000007`.

Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 7, `dp[4]` is 25, `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4**.

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, and `dp[3]` remain the same. The value of `dp[4]` is calculated and assigned a new value, which is 25. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
