Functionality: **This function calculates the nth number in a sequence where each number is calculated using the previous two numbers in the sequence, with the first two numbers being 1 and 3, and returns the calculated value. The function takes an integer n as input and returns the nth number in the sequence, which is stored in the dp array. The function performs a series of calculations to fill up the dp array, and the final state of the program is that the dp array contains the first n numbers in the sequence, with the nth number being the result of the calculation.**
