Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves.

The program uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of possible configurations for each board size up to 300000. The function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of possible configurations for a board of size n, using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.

The main part of the program reads the input, calculates the number of invalid positions (i.e., positions where a rook has already been placed), and then prints the maximum of 1 and the number of possible configurations for the remaining valid positions.

The program correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move (i.e., when the player places a rook on the diagonal), and it correctly calculates the number of possible configurations for the remaining valid positions.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
