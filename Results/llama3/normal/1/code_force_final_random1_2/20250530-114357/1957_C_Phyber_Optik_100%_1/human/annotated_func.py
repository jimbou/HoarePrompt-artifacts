#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, dp[3] is 7, dp[4] is 25, dp[5] is 157, dp[6] is 577, dp[7] is 2081, dp[8] is 7425, dp[9] is 26317, dp[10] is 93457, n is greater than or equal to 10, i is 10

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the nth number in a sequence where each number is calculated using the previous two numbers in the sequence, with the first two numbers being 1 and 3, and returns the calculated value. The function takes an integer n as input and returns the nth number in the sequence, which is stored in the dp array. The function performs a series of calculations to fill up the dp array, and the final state of the program is that the dp array contains the first n numbers in the sequence, with the nth number being the result of the calculation.
