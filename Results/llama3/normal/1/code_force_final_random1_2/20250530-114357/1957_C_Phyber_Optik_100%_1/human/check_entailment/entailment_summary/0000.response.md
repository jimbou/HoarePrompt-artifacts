Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations for the given chessboard and moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for each subproblem, and it correctly handles the mirroring of moves by the computer. The program also correctly calculates the final result modulo 10^9+7.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The use of dynamic programming is appropriate for this problem, as it allows the program to efficiently calculate the number of possible configurations for each subproblem. The program's handling of the mirroring of moves by the computer is also correct, as it correctly skips the computer's turn when the user's move cannot be mirrored.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given test cases, which further confirms its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
