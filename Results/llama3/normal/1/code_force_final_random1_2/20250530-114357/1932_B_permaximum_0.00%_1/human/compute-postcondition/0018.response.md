The only object in the loop head is variable  ai and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, ai is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and ai is the third element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `year` is equal to `ai` if `ai` is odd, otherwise `year` is equal to `2*ai` plus `ai` if `ai` is odd, otherwise `year` is equal to `2*ai` plus `2*ai`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ai` is the third element in the list `a`.**
