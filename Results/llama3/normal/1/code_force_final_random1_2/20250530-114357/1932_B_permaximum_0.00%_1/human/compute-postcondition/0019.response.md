Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `year` is equal to `ai` if `ai` is odd, otherwise `year` is equal to `2*ai` plus `ai` if `ai` is odd, otherwise `year` is equal to `2*ai` plus `2*ai`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ai` is the third element in the list `a`, and `year` is updated to be the sum of its original value and the remainder of its original value divided by `ai`, or `ai` if the remainder is zero.**

In simpler terms, the value of `year` is updated based on its original value and the value of `ai`. If `ai` is odd, `year` becomes the sum of its original value and `ai`. If `ai` is even, `year` becomes the sum of its original value and the remainder of its original value divided by `ai`, or `ai` if the remainder is zero. The other variables remain unchanged.
