Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, a is a list of integers, year is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, then reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The value of `year` is set to 0. The value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains `t-3` test cases.
