Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, a is a list of integers, year is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, as it is assigned the value of the input. The list `a` is now populated with a list of integers, as it is assigned the value of the input split into integers. The variable `year` is reset to 0, as it is assigned the value 0. The variable `_` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin now contains `t-2` test cases, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
