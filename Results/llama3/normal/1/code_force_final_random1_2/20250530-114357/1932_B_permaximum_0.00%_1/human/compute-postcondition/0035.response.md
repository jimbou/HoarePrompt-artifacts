Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It calculates a value 'year' for each test case by summing the integers and adding the sum of the remainders when the sum is divided by each integer. The function then prints the calculated 'year' value for each test case.**
