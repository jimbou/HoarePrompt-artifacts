Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, a is an empty list, year is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list a, _ is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` is empty, and the variable `year` is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, and the number of test cases in `stdin` is still `t-3`.
