To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `ai` and the list `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `year` is 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`**
