Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in the list `a`, `year` is equal to `ai` plus `ai` modulo `ai` or `ai` plus `ai`, and `_` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `year` has been updated to be equal to `ai` plus `ai` modulo `ai` or `ai` plus `ai`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `year` is now dependent on the value of `ai`, which is the third element in the list `a`.
