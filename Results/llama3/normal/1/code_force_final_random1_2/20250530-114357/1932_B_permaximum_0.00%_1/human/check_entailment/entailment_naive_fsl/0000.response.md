Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the list of sign periodicities, and for each sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur. The next year is calculated by adding the remainder of the current year divided by the sign's periodicity to the current year. If the remainder is 0, it means the sign has already occurred in the current year, so the next year is simply the current year plus the sign's periodicity.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. For example, if the input is [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18], the program correctly calculates the next year for each sign and outputs 36, which is the correct answer.

The program also handles edge cases correctly. For example, if the input is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the program correctly outputs 5, which is the correct answer.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
