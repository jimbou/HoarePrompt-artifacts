Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `year` is equal to `ai` if `ai` is odd, otherwise `year` is equal to `2*ai` plus `ai` if `ai` is even or `ai` if `ai` is odd, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ai` is the second element in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `year` is updated based on the value of `ai`. If `ai` is odd, `year` is incremented by `ai`. If `ai` is even, `year` is incremented by `ai` because `year % ai` is 0 and `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
