The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, a is an empty list, year is the sum of the original value of year and the remainder of the original value of year divided by each element in the original list a, or the element itself if the remainder is zero, _ is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the value of year is being printed**
