To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and how they change.

The loop head is `for ai in a:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `ai` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least two elements, and `ai` should be the second element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `year` is equal to `ai` if `ai` is odd, otherwise `year` is equal to `2*ai`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ai` is the second element in the list `a`.**
