Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `year` is equal to `ai` if `ai` is odd, otherwise `year` is equal to `2*ai`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `year` has been updated based on the value of `ai`, which is the first element in the list `a`. If `ai` is odd, `year` is now equal to `ai`, otherwise `year` is equal to `2*ai`. The other variables remain unchanged.
