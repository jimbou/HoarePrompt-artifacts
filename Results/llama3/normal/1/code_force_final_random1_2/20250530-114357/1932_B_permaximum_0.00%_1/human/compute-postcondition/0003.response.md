To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ai` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`, year is 0, _ is 0**
