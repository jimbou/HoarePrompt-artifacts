Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in the list `a`, `year` is equal to `ai` plus `ai` modulo `ai` or `ai`, and `_` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `year` has been updated to be equal to its previous value (`ai`) plus the result of `ai` modulo `ai` or `ai`. Since `ai` is an integer, `ai` modulo `ai` is always 0, so the expression `ai` modulo `ai` or `ai` is equivalent to `ai`. Therefore, `year` is now equal to `ai` plus `ai`, which is 2 times `ai`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
