Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, year is 0, _ is 0**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100), `n` becomes an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from stdin to `a`. Since each test case contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), `a` becomes a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The third line assigns 0 to `year`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `t` remains unchanged, but since one test case has been processed, stdin now contains `t-1` test cases.
