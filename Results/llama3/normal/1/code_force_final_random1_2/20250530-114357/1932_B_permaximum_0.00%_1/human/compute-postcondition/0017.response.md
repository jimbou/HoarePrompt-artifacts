Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `year` is equal to `ai` if `ai` is odd, otherwise `year` is equal to `2*ai` plus `ai` if `ai` is odd, otherwise `year` is equal to `2*ai` plus `2*ai`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `ai` is the second element in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `year` is updated based on the value of `ai`. If `ai` is odd, `year` is equal to `ai` plus `ai`, which is `2*ai`. If `ai` is even, `year` is equal to `2*ai` plus `2*ai`, which is `4*ai`.
