The code `year += year % ai or ai` updates the value of `year` by adding the result of the expression `year % ai or ai` to it. The expression `year % ai or ai` evaluates to the remainder of `year` divided by `ai` if `year` is not divisible by `ai`, or `ai` if `year` is divisible by `ai`.

Since `ai` is the first element in the list `a` and `a` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `ai` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.

The value of `year` is initially 0, so `year % ai` is always 0. Therefore, the expression `year % ai or ai` always evaluates to `ai`.

So, the code `year += year % ai or ai` is equivalent to `year += ai`, which adds the value of `ai` to `year`.

The output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`, `year` is equal to `ai`, and `_` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`, `year` is equal to `ai`, and `_` is 0.**
