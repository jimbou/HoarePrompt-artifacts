Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    year = 0
    for ai in a:
        year += year % ai or ai
    print(year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, a is an empty list, ai is undefined, year is equal to the sum of all elements in the initial list a plus the sum of all elements in the initial list a modulo each element in the initial list a or each element in the initial list a, and _ is 0, and the value of year is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, a is an empty list, year is the sum of the original value of year and the remainder of the original value of year divided by each element in the original list a, or the element itself if the remainder is zero, _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the value of year is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, a is an empty list, year is equal to the sum of all elements in the original list a which is 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and the year which is 0 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
