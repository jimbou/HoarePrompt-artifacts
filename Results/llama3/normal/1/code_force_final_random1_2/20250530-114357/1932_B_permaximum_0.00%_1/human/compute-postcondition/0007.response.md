To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `ai` and the list `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in the list `a`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `ai` must be the third element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in the list `a`, `year` is equal to `ai` plus `ai` modulo `ai` or `ai`, and `_` is 0**
