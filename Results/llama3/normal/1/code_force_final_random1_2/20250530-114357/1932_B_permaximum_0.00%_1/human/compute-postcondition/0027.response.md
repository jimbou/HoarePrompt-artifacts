To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for ai in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `ai` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, and `ai` is the first element in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `ai` must be the second element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `year` is equal to `ai` if `ai` is odd, otherwise `year` is equal to `2*ai`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `ai` is the second element in the list `a`.**
