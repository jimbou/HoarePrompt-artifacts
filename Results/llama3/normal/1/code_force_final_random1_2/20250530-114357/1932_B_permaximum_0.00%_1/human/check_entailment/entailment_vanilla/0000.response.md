Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The signs occur sequentially, and the tribe waits for the next sign to occur strictly after the previous one.

The given program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read the number of signs `n`.
3. Read the periodicities of the signs `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
4. Initialize the `year` variable to 0.
5. Iterate through the periodicities `a_i`:
   - For each `a_i`, calculate the next occurrence of the sign by adding the remainder of `year` divided by `a_i` (i.e., `year % ai`) to `year`. If `year` is a multiple of `a_i`, `year % ai` will be 0, so we add `ai` to `year` to get the next occurrence.
   - This effectively "waits" for the next sign to occur after the previous one.
6. After iterating through all signs, print the final `year` value, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently solves the problem by iterating through the signs only once. The use of the modulo operator (`%`) to calculate the next occurrence of each sign is a clever optimization.

Correctness: **True**
