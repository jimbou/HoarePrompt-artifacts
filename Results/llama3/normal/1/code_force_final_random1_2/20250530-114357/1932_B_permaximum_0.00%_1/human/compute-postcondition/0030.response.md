Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `year` is equal to `ai` if `ai` is odd, otherwise `year` is equal to `2*ai` plus `ai` if `ai` is even or `ai` if `ai` is odd, plus `year % ai` or `ai`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `ai` is the third element in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `year` has been updated by adding the remainder of `year` divided by `ai` (if `ai` is not a factor of `year`) or `ai` (if `ai` is a factor of `year`) to its original value. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
