Output State: **The program returns a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains the number 25 and a sequence. The sequence is a list of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.**

In this output state, the list `results` contains `t` number of tuples. Each tuple has two elements: the number 25 and a sequence. The sequence is a list of powers of 2, starting from 2^0 (which is 1) up to 2^24. The values of `t`, `cases`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the returned value, as the `return` statement only returns the `results` list.
