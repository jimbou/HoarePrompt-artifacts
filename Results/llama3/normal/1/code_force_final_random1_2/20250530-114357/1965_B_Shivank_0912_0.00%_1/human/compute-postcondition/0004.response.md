The code appends a new tuple (25, sequence) to the results list. The value of sequence is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 2 pairs, `results` is a list containing two tuples (25, sequence), `sequence` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, `n` is the second n in the second pair in cases, `k` is the second k in the second pair in cases**
