Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is an empty list, results is a list containing t tuples (25, sequence), sequence is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, n is the last n in the last pair in the initial cases, k is the last k in the last pair in the initial cases**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` remains a positive integer, the list `cases` becomes empty because all pairs have been processed, the list `results` contains `t` tuples, each containing the value 25 and the list `sequence`, which remains unchanged. The variables `n` and `k` take the values of the last pair in the initial list `cases`.
