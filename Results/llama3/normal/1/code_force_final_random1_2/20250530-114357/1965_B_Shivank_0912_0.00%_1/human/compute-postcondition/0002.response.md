Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 1 pair, `results` is a list containing a tuple (25, sequence), `sequence` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, `n` is the first n in the first pair in cases, `k` is the first k in the first pair in cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list `cases` still contains at least one pair of positive integers. The list `results` now contains a tuple with the value 25 and the entire `sequence` list, which still contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24. The values of `n` and `k` remain the same as the first pair in the `cases` list.
