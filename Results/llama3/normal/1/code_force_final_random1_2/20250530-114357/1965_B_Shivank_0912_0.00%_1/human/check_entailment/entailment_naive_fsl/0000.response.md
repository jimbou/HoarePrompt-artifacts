Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the fact that the program always returns a sequence of 25 elements, which is not necessarily the minimum size required to satisfy the conditions. 

For example, when n = 2 and k = 2, the program returns a sequence of 25 elements, whereas a single element 1 would be sufficient. This is because there is no subsequence of [1] with a sum of 2, and there is a subsequence [1] with a sum of 1.

The program should return a sequence of minimum size that satisfies the conditions, not always a sequence of 25 elements.
