The code initializes an empty list called `results` and a list called `sequence` containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24. The initial state's variables `t` and `cases` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **t is a positive integer, cases is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, results is an empty list, sequence is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24**
