Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 3 pairs, `results` is a list containing three tuples (25, sequence), `sequence` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, `n` is the third n in the third pair in cases, `k` is the third k in the third pair in cases**

The code appends a new tuple (25, sequence) to the `results` list. The `results` list now contains three tuples, each with the value 25 and the same `sequence` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
