To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `(n, k)` and `cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cases` list. If the list has at least 2 pairs, the loop executes again for the second pair. At the end of the last iteration, `cases` has at least 1 pair, `n` is the first `n` in the first pair, and `k` is the first `k` in the first pair.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cases` must have at least 2 pairs, and `(n, k)` should be the second pair in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 2 pairs, `results` is a list containing a tuple (25, sequence), `sequence` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, `n` is the second n in the second pair in cases, `k` is the second k in the second pair in cases**
