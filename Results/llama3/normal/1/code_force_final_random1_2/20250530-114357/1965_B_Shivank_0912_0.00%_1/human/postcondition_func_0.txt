This function takes in a positive integer t and a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) as input, and returns a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains the number 25 and a sequence of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24. The function does not modify the input variables and does not perform any actions other than generating and returning the list of tuples.
