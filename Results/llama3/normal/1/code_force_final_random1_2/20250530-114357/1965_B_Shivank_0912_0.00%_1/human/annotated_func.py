#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, cases is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
    results = []
    sequence = [(2 ** i) for i in range(25)]
    for (n, k) in cases:
        results.append((25, sequence))
        
    #State: t is a positive integer, cases is an empty list, results is a list containing t tuples (25, sequence), sequence is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, n is the last n in the last pair in the initial cases, k is the last k in the last pair in the initial cases
    return results
    #The program returns a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains the number 25 and a sequence. The sequence is a list of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes in a positive integer t and a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) as input, and returns a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains the number 25 and a sequence of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24. The function does not modify the input variables and does not perform any actions other than generating and returning the list of tuples.
