Functionality: This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of pairs of positive integers `cases` as input, where each pair contains a value `n` between 2 and 10^6 and a value `k` between 1 and `n`. The function generates a sequence of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24 and returns a list of `t` tuples, each containing the number 25 and the generated sequence. The input list `cases` is not modified or used in any calculations, and the values of `n` and `k` are not utilized in the function's output. The function's purpose is to generate a list of tuples containing the number 25 and a sequence of powers of 2, regardless of the input values.
