To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for (n, k) in cases:`

The objects in the loop head are `n`, `k`, and `cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cases` list. If the list has at least one more pair, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `cases` has at least 2 pairs, `n` is the second `n` in the second pair, and `k` is the second `k` in the second pair.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cases` must have at least 3 pairs, and `n` and `k` must be the third `n` and `k` in the third pair, respectively.

The other variables `t`, `results`, and `sequence` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 3 pairs, `results` is a list containing two tuples (25, sequence), `sequence` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, `n` is the third n in the third pair in cases, `k` is the third k in the third pair in cases**
