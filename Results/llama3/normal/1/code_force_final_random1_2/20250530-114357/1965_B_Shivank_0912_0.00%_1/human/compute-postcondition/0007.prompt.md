Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, cases is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, results is an empty list, sequence is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24
Code of the loop:
for n, k in cases:
    results.append((25, sequence))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 1 pair, `results` is a list containing a tuple (25, sequence), `sequence` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, `n` is the first n in the first pair in cases, `k` is the first k in the first pair in cases

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 2 pairs, `results` is a list containing two tuples (25, sequence), `sequence` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, `n` is the second n in the second pair in cases, `k` is the second k in the second pair in cases

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of pairs of positive integers (n, k) that must have at least 3 pairs, `results` is a list containing three tuples (25, sequence), `sequence` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, `n` is the third n in the third pair in cases, `k` is the third k in the third pair in cases




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
