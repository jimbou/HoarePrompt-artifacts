Output State: **t is an integer equal to 0, a is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is a positive integer equal to the second integer from the input, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a, b) repeated t times, stdin is empty, _ is t-1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the variable t is now 0. The variables a and b still hold the values of the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The results list contains the result of func_1(a, b) repeated t times, where t is the initial value of t. The stdin is empty, and the loop variable _ is equal to t-1.
