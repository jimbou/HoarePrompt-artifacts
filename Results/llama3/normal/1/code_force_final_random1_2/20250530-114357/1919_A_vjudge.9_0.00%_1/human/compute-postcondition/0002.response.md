Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, a is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is a positive integer equal to the second integer from the input, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a, b), stdin is empty, _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the integers from the input, and the result of `func_1(a, b)` has been appended to the `results` list. The `stdin` is now empty since it has been used to read the input. The value of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
