The function reads a specified number of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers. It then calls another function, func_1, with these integers as arguments, and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list. The function does not modify the input values or perform any other actions beyond reading input, calling func_1, and printing results.
