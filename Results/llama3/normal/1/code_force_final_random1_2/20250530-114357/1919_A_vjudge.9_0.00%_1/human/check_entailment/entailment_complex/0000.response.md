Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move. The problem statement provides examples and test cases to illustrate the game's behavior.

Function 1 takes the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets as input and returns the winner based on the total number of coins. If the total is even, it returns 'Bob', and if the total is odd, it returns 'Alice'. This function correctly implements the game's logic, as the winner is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

Function 2 reads a specified number of test cases from standard input, calls Function 1 with the input values, and prints the results. This function correctly handles the input/output operations and delegates the game logic to Function 1.

Based on the provided execution states, both functions behave as expected. Function 1 correctly determines the winner based on the input values, and Function 2 correctly reads input, calls Function 1, and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
