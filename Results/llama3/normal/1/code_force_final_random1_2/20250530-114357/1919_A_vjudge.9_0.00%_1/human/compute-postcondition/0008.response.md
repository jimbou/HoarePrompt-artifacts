To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `t` is 0, the list `results` must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute. Also, `result` will be the first element in the `results` list.

State: **`t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is a positive integer equal to the second integer from the input, `results` is a list containing at least 1 element, `result` is the first element in the `results` list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is -1**
