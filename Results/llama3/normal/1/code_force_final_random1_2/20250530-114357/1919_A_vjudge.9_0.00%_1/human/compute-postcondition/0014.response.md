To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.

The loop head is `for result in results:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of the `results` list. The only object in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `result`, which is the variable that takes on the value of each element in the `results` list during each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `result` was the second element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute again, `result` needs to take on the value of the next element in the `results` list.

Since `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements, and `result` is the second element, the next element would be the third element in the list.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is a positive integer equal to the second integer from the input, `results` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `result` is the third element in the `results` list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is -1**
