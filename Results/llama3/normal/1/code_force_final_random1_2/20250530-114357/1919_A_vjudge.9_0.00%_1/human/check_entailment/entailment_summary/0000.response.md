Reasoning:

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn. A valid move consists of choosing to exchange wallets with their opponent or keeping their current wallet, followed by removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step.

Function `func_1` determines the winner based on the total number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the total is even, the function returns 'Bob', indicating Bob as the winner. If the total is odd, the function returns 'Alice', indicating Alice as the winner.

This logic is correct because if the total number of coins is even, Alice will always be forced to make a move that leaves Bob with an odd number of coins, allowing Bob to win. Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins, forcing Bob to lose.

Function `func_2` reads a specified number of test cases from standard input, calls `func_1` with the input values, and prints the results. This function does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
