Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, a is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is a positive integer equal to the second integer from the input, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a, b) three times, stdin is empty, _ is 2**

The code block first reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively. Since `stdin` is empty, this operation does not change the state of `stdin`. The value of `a` and `b` are updated to the new values read from the input.

The second line calls the function `func_1(a, b)` and assigns its result to the variable `winner`. This operation does not change the state of any variables, but it does create a new variable `winner` with the result of the function call.

The third line appends the value of `winner` to the list `results`. Since `results` already contains two elements (the result of `func_1(a, b)` called twice), this operation adds a third element to the list, making it contain the result of `func_1(a, b)` three times.

The value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the code block, as they are not modified by any of the lines.
