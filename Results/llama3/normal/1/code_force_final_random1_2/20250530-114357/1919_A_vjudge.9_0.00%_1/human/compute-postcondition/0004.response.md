Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, a is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is a positive integer equal to the second integer from the input, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a, b) and the result of func_1(a, b) again, stdin is empty, _ is 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The `results` list now contains the result of `func_1(a, b)` twice, as the code appends the result of `func_1(a, b)` to the list again. The `stdin` remains empty as it was initially.
