Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The function `func_1` checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd, and returns 'Bob' if it's even and 'Alice' if it's odd. This is because the game is won by the player who can make the last move, and the number of moves is determined by the sum of the coins in both wallets.

The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and the number of coins in each wallet, and calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case. It then prints the results.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and edge cases, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
