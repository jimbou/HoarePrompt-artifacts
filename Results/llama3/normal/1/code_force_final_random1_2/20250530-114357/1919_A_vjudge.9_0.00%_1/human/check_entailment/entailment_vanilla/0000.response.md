Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game played between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It returns the winner of the game based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.

The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins. If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the players alternate turns, and each turn involves removing one coin. If the total number of coins is even, the last coin will be removed by Bob, making him the winner. If the total number of coins is odd, the last coin will be removed by Alice, making her the winner.

`func_2` reads the number of test cases and the input values for `a` and `b` for each test case. It calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
