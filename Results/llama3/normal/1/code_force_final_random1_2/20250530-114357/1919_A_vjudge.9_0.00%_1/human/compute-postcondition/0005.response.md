To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2.

The other variables `a`, `b`, `results`, `stdin`, and `t` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is a positive integer equal to the second integer from the input, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(a, b)` and the result of `func_1(a, b)` again, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 2**
