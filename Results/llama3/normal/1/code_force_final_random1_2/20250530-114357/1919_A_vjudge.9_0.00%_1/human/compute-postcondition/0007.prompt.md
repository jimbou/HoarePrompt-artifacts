Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains 1 less input: a string
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
    winner = func_1(a, b)
    results.append(winner)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, a is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is a positive integer equal to the second integer from the input, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a, b), stdin is empty, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 1, a is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is a positive integer equal to the second integer from the input, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a, b) and the result of func_1(a, b) again, stdin is empty, _ is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 2, a is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, b is a positive integer equal to the second integer from the input, results is a list containing the result of func_1(a, b) three times, stdin is empty, _ is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
