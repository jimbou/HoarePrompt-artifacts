Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is a positive integer equal to the first integer from the input, `b` is a positive integer equal to the second integer from the input, `results` is a list containing the result of func_1(a, b) repeated t times, `stdin` is empty, `_` is -1, and all elements in the `results` list have been printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that all elements in the `results` list have been printed, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial values.
