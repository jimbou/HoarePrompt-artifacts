Reasoning:

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn. A valid move consists of choosing to exchange wallets with their opponent or keeping their current wallet, followed by removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, which means their wallet is empty.

The given program uses a simple and clever approach to determine the winner. It calculates the sum of the coins in both wallets (a + b) and checks if it is even or odd. If the sum is even, the program returns 'Bob', indicating that Bob will win the game. If the sum is odd, the program returns 'Alice', indicating that Alice will win the game.

The reasoning behind this approach is that the game can be viewed as a series of moves, where each move consists of removing 1 coin from the current wallet. Since the sum of the coins in both wallets is constant, the game can be reduced to a simple parity game. If the sum is even, Bob will always have an even number of coins in his wallet, which means he can always make a valid move by removing 1 coin. On the other hand, if the sum is odd, Alice will always have an odd number of coins in her wallet, which means she can always make a valid move by removing 1 coin.

Therefore, the given program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
