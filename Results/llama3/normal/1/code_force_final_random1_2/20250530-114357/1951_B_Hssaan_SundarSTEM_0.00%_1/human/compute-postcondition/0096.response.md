Output State: **`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `p` are integers or lists of integers. `s` has at least 2 elements. `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the `k`th element of the original list `s`. `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`. `j` is `k`-2. `_` is 1. `i` is the second element of `s`. `p` is `k`-2. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. `z` is 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 0 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0. If `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of `z` being 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans1` and the break statement are still dependent on the values of `s[0]`, `i`, `h`, and `z`.
