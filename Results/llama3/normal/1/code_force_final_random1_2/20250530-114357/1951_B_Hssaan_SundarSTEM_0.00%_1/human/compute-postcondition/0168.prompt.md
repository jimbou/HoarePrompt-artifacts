Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is the original list of integers, ans is the number of elements in s[1:] that are greater than or equal to h, h is the k-1th element of the original list, j is the number of elements in s[1:] that are greater than or equal to h minus 1, _ is 2, i is the last element in s[1:] that is greater than or equal to h, p is the number of elements in s[1:] that are greater than or equal to h minus 1, ans1 is 0, z is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty, `h` is the `k-1`th element of the original list, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are greater than or equal to `h`, `j` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are greater than or equal to `h` minus 1, `_` is 2, `i` is the first element in `s`, `p` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are greater than or equal to `h` minus 1, `ans1` is either 0 or 1, `z` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 0 or 1 and `z` is 1. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than `h`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 0 or 1 and `z` is either 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `ans`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `p`, `ans1` are integers or lists of integers. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 1 or 2 and `z` is 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 1 or 2 and `z` is 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 1 or 2 and `z` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k`, `s` has at least 2 elements, `h`, `ans`, `j`, `_`, `i` is the second element in `s`, `p`, `ans1` is either 1 or 2, `z` is 1. If `i` is equal to `h`, then if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
