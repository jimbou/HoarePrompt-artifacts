Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s` and its current value is less than `i`, `j` is 0, `_` is 0, `i` is the second element of the list `s`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers.**
