Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s` and its current value is less than `i`, `j` is 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the second element of `s`, `p` is not defined, `ans1` is not defined, `z` is not defined, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program flow is affected by the break statement.
