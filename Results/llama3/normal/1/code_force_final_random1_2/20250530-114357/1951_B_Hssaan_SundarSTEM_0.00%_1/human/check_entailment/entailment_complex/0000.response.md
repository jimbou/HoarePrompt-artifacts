Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n distinct integers.

For each test case, the program swaps the first and kth elements of the list, then calculates the number of elements in the list (excluding the first element) that are less than or equal to the kth element. This is done by iterating through the list and incrementing the count `ans` as long as the current element is less than or equal to the kth element.

The program then swaps the first and kth elements back to their original positions and calculates the number of elements in the list (excluding the first element) that are equal to the kth element and appear after the first occurrence of the kth element. This is done by iterating through the list and incrementing the count `ans1` as long as the current element is equal to the kth element and appears after the first occurrence of the kth element.

Finally, the program prints the maximum of the two counts `ans` and `ans1` for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
