Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, ans is 0, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is -1, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 0, `i` is the second element of the list `s`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `h` is less than `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1 or 2, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `_` is 0, `i` is the third element of the list `s`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, `i` is the fourth element of the list `s`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
