Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `j` is `k`-2, `_` is 1, `i` is the second element of `s`, `p` is `k`-2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been incremented by 1. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is now 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is now 2 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
