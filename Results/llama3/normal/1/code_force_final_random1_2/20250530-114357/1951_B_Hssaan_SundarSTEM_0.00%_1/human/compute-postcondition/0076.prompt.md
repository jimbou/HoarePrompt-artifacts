Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with at least k elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, ans is 0, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is -1, _ is 1, i is not defined, p is not defined, ans1 is not defined, z is not defined, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `ans` is 0 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s`, otherwise `ans` is 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the second element of `s`, `p` is not defined, `ans1` is not defined, `z` is not defined, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `_` is 1, `i` is the third element of `s`, `p` is not defined, `ans1` is not defined, `z` is not defined, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the third element of `s`, `ans` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s`, otherwise `ans` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `_` is 1, `i` is the fourth element of `s`, `p` is not defined, `ans1` is not defined, `z` is not defined, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the fourth element of `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the third element of `s`, `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s`, `ans` is 2, otherwise `ans` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
