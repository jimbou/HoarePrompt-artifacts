Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with at least k elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, ans is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or k-1, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is k-1, _ is 0, i is the kth element of the list s, p is k-1, ans1 is 0, z is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements and the first and (`k-1`)th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `k-1`, `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `j` is `k-1`, `_` is 0, `i` is the first element of the list `s`, `p` is `k-1`, `ans1` is either 0 or 1, `z` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 0 or 1 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `z` is 1, `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1; otherwise, no changes are made to `ans1` and `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements and the first and (`k-1`)th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `k-1`, `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `j` is `k`, `_` is 0, `i` is the second element of the list `s`, `p` is `k`, `ans1` is either 0, 1, or 2, `z` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is 2. If `s[0]` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements and the first and (`k-1`)th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `k-1`, `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `j` is `k`, `_` is 0, `i` is the third element of the list `s`, `p` is `k`, `ans1` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `z` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is either 2 or 3. If `s[0]` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 1 or 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
