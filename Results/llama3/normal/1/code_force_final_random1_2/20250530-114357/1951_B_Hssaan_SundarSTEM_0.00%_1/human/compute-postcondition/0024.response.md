Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements and the first and (`k-1`)th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `k-1`, `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `j` is `k-1`, `_` is 0, `i` is the first element of the list `s` and equals `h`, `p` is `k-1`, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. The first element of the list `s` is not equal to `h`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers.
