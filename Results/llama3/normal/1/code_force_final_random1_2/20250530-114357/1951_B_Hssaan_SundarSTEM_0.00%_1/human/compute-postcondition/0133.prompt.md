Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with the first and k-1th elements swapped, ans is 0, h is the k-1th element of the original list, j is -1, _ is 2, i is undefined, p is undefined, stdin contains 0 inputs, ans1 is undefined, z is undefined
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements with the first and k-1th elements swapped, `ans` is 0 if the k-1th element of the original list is less than the second element in the list, otherwise `ans` is 1, `h` is the k-1th element of the original list, `j` is 0, `_` is 2, `i` is the second element in the list, `p` is undefined, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `ans1` is undefined, `z` is undefined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1`, `z` are integers, lists, or undefined values. If `h` is less than `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if the k-1th element of the original list is less than the second element in the list, otherwise `ans` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1`, `z` are integers, lists, or undefined values, `i` is the next element in the list `s` after the previous `i`, `j` is increased by 1. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
