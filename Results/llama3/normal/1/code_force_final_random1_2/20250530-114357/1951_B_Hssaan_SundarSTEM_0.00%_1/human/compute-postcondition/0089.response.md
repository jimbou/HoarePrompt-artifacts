Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `j` is `k`-2, `_` is 1, `i` is the first element of `s`, `p` is `k`-2, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. The first element of `s` is not equal to the `k`th element of the original list `s`. The first element of `s` is less than or equal to the `k`th element of the original list `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans1` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `ans1` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the first element of `s` and the `k`th element of the original list `s` are still valid.
