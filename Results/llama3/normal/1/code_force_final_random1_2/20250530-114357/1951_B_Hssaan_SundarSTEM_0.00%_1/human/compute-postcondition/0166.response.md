Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s` has at least 2 elements, `h`, `ans`, `j`, `_`, `i` is the second element in `s`, `p`, `ans1` is either 1 or 2, `z` is 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, `ans1` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
