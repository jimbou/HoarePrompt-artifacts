Output State: **`n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `ans`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `p`, `ans1`, `z`, and `stdin` are integers or lists of integers. `s` has at least `k` elements and the first and (`k-1`)th elements swapped a number of times equal to the number of test cases in `stdin`. `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the `k`th element of the original list `s`. `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`. `j` is `k` minus the number of test cases in `stdin` minus 1. `_` is the number of test cases in `stdin` minus 1. `i` is the last element of `s`. `p` is `k` minus the number of test cases in `stdin` minus 1. `ans1` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` and appear after the first occurrence of `h` in `s`. `z` is 1. `stdin` contains 0 inputs. The maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is being printed for each test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input, and for each test case, it has swapped the first and (`k-1`)th elements of the list `s` a number of times equal to the number of test cases, and has calculated the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` and printed it. The values of `n`, `k`, `h`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `p`, `ans1`, and `z` have been updated accordingly, and `stdin` is empty.
