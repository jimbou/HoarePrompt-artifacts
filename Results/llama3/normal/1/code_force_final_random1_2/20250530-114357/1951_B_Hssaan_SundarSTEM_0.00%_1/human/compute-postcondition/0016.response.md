Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1 or 2, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, `i` is the fourth element of the list `s`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the program will exit the current loop or if statement and continue executing the code outside of it.
