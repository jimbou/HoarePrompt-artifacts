Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `j` is `k`-2, `_` is 1, `i` is the first element of `s`, `p` is `k`-2, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. The current value of `i` is not equal to the current value of `h`.***
