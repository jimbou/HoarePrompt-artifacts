Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 1, `i` is the second element of `s`, `p` is not defined, `ans1` is not defined, `z` is not defined, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. The kth element of the original list `s` is larger than or equal to the second element of `s`.***
