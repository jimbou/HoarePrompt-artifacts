Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1`, `z` are integers, lists, or undefined values. If `h` is less than `i`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if the k-1th element of the original list is less than the second element in the list, otherwise `ans` is 2.**
