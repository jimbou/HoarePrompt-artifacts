Output State: **`n`, `k`, `s` has at least 2 elements, `h`, `ans`, `j`, `_`, `i` is the second element in `s`, `p`, `ans1` is either 1 or 2, `z` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
