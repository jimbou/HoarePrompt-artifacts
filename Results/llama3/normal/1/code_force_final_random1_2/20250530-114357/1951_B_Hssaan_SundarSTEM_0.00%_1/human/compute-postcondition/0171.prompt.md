Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). It is guaranteed that a_i 's are pairwise different.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans = 0
    h = s[0]
    j = -1
    for i in s[1:]:
        j += 1
        if h < i:
            break
        else:
            ans += 1
    p = j
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans1 = 0
    s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
    z = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == h:
            if s[0] != h:
                ans1 += 1
            z = 1
        elif i > h:
            break
        elif z == 1:
            ans1 += 1
    print(max(ans, ans1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements and the first and (`k-1`)th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `k-1`, `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `j` is `k-1`, `_` is 0, `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `p` is `k-1`, `ans1` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `k-1`, `z` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `k-1`. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is either 2, 3, ..., or `k-1`. If `s[0]` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 1, 2, ..., or `k-1`, and the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `p`, `stdin` are integers or lists of integers. `s` has at least `k` elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the `k`th element of the original list `s`. `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`. `j` is `k`-2. `_` is 1. `i` is the last element of `s`. `p` is `k`-2. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. `ans1` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` and appear after the first occurrence of `h` in `s`. `z` is 1. The maximum of `ans` and `ans1` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `ans`, `j`, `_`, `i` is the last element in `s[1:]` that is greater than or equal to `h`, `p`, `ans1` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are greater than or equal to `h` plus the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` minus 1 if the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`, `z` is 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, and the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
