Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, ans is 0, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is -1, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the first line of the input. The list `s` has its first and (k-1)th elements swapped, as per the second line of the code. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, and `h` is assigned the value of the kth element of the original list `s`. The variable `j` is set to -1. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus the 2 inputs that were read: 2 integers and a list of integers.
