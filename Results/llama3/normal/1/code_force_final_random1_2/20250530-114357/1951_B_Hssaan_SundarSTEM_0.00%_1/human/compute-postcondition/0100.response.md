Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `p`, `stdin` are as described in the precondition. If `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 0 if `z` is not 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0. If `z` is 1 and `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2.**
