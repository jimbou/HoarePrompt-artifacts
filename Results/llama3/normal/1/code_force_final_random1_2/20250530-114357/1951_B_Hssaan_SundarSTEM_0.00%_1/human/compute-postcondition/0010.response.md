Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `_` is 0, `i` is the third element of the list `s`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
