State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements and the first and (`k-1`)th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `k-1`, `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `j` is `k`, `_` is 0, `i` is the third element of the list `s`, `p` is `k`, `ans1` is either 0, 1, or 2, `z` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is 2. If `s[0]` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1.**
