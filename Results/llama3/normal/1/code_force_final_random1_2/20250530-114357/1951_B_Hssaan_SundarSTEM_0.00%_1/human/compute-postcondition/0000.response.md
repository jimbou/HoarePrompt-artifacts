According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input must have at least 1 test case and the variable `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case, `_` is 0**
