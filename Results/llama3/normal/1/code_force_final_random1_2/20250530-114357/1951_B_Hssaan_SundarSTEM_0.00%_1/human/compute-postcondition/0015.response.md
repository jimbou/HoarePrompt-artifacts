Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1 or 2, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, `i` is the fourth element of the list `s`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `_`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The condition regarding `h` and `i` and the value of `ans` also remains the same. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers.
