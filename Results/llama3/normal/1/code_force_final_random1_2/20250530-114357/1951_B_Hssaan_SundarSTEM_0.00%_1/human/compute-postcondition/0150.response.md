State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `h` is the `k-1`th element of the original list, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are greater than or equal to `h`, `j` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are greater than or equal to `h` minus 1, `_` is 2, `i` is the second element in `s`, `p` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are greater than or equal to `h` minus 1, `ans1` is either 0 or 1, `z` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 0 or 1 and `z` is 1. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than `h`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 0 or 1 and `z` is either 0 or 1.**
