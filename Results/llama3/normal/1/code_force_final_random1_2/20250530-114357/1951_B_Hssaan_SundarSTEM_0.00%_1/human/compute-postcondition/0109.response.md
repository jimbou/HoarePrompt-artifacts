Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `p`, `stdin` are integers or lists of integers. `s` has at least 3 elements. `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the `k`th element of the original list `s`. `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`. `j` is `k`-2. `_` is 1. `i` is the third element of `s`. `p` is `k`-2. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, then if `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 2 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 3 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 2. If `z` is not 1, then if `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 0 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1.**
