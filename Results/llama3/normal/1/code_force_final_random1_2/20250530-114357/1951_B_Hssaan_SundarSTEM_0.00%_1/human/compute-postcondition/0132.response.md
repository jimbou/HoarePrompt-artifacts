Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `p`, `stdin`, `ans1`, `z` are integers, lists, or undefined values, `i` is the next element in the list `s` after the previous `i`, `j` is increased by 1. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by 1.***
