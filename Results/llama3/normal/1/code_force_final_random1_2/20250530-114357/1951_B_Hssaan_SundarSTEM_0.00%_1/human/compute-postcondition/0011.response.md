Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `_` is 0, `i` is the third element of the list `s`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers.
