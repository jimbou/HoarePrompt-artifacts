Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 2, `_` is 0, `i` is the fourth element of the list `s`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `h` is less than `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2.***
