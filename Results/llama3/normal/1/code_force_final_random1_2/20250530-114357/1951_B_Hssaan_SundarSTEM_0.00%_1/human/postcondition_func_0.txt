This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n distinct integers. For each test case, it swaps the first and kth elements of the list, then calculates the number of elements in the list (excluding the first element) that are less than or equal to the kth element. It also calculates the number of elements in the list (excluding the first element) that are equal to the kth element and appear after the first occurrence of the kth element. The function then prints the maximum of these two counts for each test case.
