Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers that must have at least k elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped twice, ans is the number of elements in s[1:] that are less than or equal to the kth element of the original list s, h is the kth element of the original list s, j is k-2, _ is 1, i is the last element of s, p is k-2, ans1 is 0, z is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`, `j` is `k`-2, `_` is 1, `i` is the first element of `s`, `p` is `k`-2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 0 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0. If `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `p`, `stdin` are integers or lists of integers. `s` has at least 2 elements. `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the `k`th element of the original list `s`. `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`. `j` is `k`-2. `_` is 1. `i` is the second element of `s`. `p` is `k`-2. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 0 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0. If `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `p`, `stdin` are integers or lists of integers. `s` has at least 3 elements. `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the `k`th element of the original list `s`. `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`. `j` is `k`-2. `_` is 1. `i` is the third element of `s`. `p` is `k`-2. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 0 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0. If `i` is greater than `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1. If `z` is not 1, then if `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 0 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 0. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then if `i` is equal to `h`, `ans1` is 1 and `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 2 if `z` is 1, otherwise `ans1` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
