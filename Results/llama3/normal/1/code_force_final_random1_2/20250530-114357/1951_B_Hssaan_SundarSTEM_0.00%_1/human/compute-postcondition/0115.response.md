Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is a list of integers with the first and k-1th elements swapped, ans is 0, h is the k-1th element of the original list, j is -1, _ is 2, i is undefined, p is undefined, stdin contains 0 inputs, ans1 is undefined, z is undefined**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the two integers read from the input. The list `s` is also updated by swapping its first and k-1th elements. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, and `h` is set to the k-1th element of the original list. The variable `j` is set to -1. The values of `_`, `i`, `p`, `ans1`, and `z` remain unchanged. The stdin is now empty, as all inputs have been read.
