Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are greater than or equal to `h`, `h` is the `k-1`th element of the original list, `j` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are greater than or equal to `h` minus 1, `_` is 2, `i` is the first element in `s`, `p` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are greater than or equal to `h` minus 1, `ans1` is 0 or 1, `z` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. The first element of `s` is not equal to the `k-1`th element of the original list. If the first element of `s` is greater than `h`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the first element of `s` is less than or equal to `h`.***
