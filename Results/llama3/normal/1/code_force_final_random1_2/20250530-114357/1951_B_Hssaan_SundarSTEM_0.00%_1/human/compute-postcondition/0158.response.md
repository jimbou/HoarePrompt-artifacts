Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `ans`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `p`, `ans1` are integers or lists of integers. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 1 or 2 and `z` is 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 1 or 2 and `z` is 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is either 1 or 2 and `z` is 1.**
