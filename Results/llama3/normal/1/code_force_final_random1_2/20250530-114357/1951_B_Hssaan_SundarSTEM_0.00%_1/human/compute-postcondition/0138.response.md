Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that is not empty, `h` is the `k-1`th element of the original list, `i` is the first element in `s` and equals `h`, `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are greater than or equal to `h`, `j` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are greater than or equal to `h` minus 1, `p` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are greater than or equal to `h` minus 1, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, and the current value of `s[0]` is not equal to `h`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `h`, `i`, `ans`, `j`, `p`, `z`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans1` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The stdin still contains 0 inputs. The current value of `s[0]` is still not equal to `h`.
