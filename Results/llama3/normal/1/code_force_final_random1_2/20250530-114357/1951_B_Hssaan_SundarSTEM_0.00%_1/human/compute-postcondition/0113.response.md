Output: ** `n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_`, `i`, `p`, `stdin` are integers or lists of integers. `s` has at least `k` elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped twice. `ans` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are less than or equal to the `k`th element of the original list `s`. `h` is the `k`th element of the original list `s`. `j` is `k`-2. `_` is 1. `i` is the last element of `s`. `p` is `k`-2. `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. `ans1` is the number of elements in `s[1:]` that are equal to `h` and appear after the first occurrence of `h` in `s`. `z` is 1. The maximum of `ans` and `ans1` is being printed.**
