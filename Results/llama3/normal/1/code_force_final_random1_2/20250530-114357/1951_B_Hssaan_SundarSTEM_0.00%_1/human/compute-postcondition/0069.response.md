Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `ans` is 1 if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s`, otherwise `ans` is 2, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 1, `_` is 1, `i` is the third element of `s`, `p` is not defined, `ans1` is not defined, `z` is not defined, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. If the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. If the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s`, `ans` becomes 1, otherwise it becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the kth element of the original list `s` is less than the second element of `s`.
