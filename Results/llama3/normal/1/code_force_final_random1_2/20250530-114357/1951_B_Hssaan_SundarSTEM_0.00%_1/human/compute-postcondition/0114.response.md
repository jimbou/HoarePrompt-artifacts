The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `int(input())` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and `int(input())` must be at least 2.
State: **`n`, `k`, `s`, `ans`, `h`, `j`, `_` is 2, `i`, `p`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 1 input: 2 integers and a list of integers, `ans1`, `z`**
