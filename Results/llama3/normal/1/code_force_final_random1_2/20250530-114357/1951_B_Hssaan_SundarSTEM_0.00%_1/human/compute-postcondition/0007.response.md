Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `s` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and the first and (k-1)th elements swapped, `ans` is 1, `h` is the kth element of the original list `s`, `j` is 0, `_` is 0, `i` is the second element of the list `s`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, and `h` is not less than `i`**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1, so the new value of `ans` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. The relationship between `h` and `i` also remains the same, with `h` not being less than `i`.
