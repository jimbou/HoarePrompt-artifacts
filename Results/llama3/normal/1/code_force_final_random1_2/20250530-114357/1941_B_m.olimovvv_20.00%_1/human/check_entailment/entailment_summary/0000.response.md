Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

The key insight is that the operations can only decrease the values of the elements, and the parity of the elements (odd or even) is preserved. The program checks if the first and last elements of the array meet certain conditions:

* If the first element is odd, the second element must be 2 more than the first element.
* If the last element is odd, the second last element must be 2 more than the last element.

If these conditions are not met, it's impossible to make all elements zero, and the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the first or last element is zero, and it correctly handles the case where the array has only three elements.

Correctness: **True**
