Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = int(input())
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1
        ] + 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, b is a list of integers of length a, stdin is empty. If the first element of b is odd and the second element is not the first element plus 2, or the last element of b is odd and the second last element is not the last element plus 2, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *a is an integer, b is a list of integers, stdin is empty. If the first element of b is odd and not equal to the second element minus 2, or the last element of b is odd and not equal to the second last element minus 2, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *a is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, b is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, stdin is empty. If the first element of b is odd and not equal to the second element plus 2, or the last element of b is odd and not equal to the second last element plus 2, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
