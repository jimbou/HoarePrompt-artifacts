Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, b is a list of integers of length a, stdin is empty**

The code consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `a`. Since the input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), `a` becomes an integer between 1 and 10^4. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `b`. Since each test case consists of an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers, `b` becomes a list of integers of length `a`. After the execution of the code, stdin is empty because all the input has been consumed.
