Output State: **a is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, b is a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the first input from stdin to `a`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the second input from stdin to `b`. After these two lines, stdin is empty because both inputs have been consumed. The initial values of `a` and `b` are overwritten by the new values from stdin.
