To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and understand what conditions must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute as long as there is input to read from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` is empty. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must not be empty.

State: **a is an integer, b is a list of integers, stdin is not empty**
