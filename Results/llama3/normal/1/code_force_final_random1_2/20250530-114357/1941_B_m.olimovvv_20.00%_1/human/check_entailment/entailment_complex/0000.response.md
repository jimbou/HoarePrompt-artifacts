Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

The program correctly reads the input, checks the conditions for the first and last elements of each test case, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The conditions checked are:

- If the first element is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, print 'NO'.
- If the last element is odd and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, print 'NO'.
- Otherwise, print 'YES'.

These conditions are sufficient to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations. 

The program also correctly handles the case where the input stream is empty after processing all test cases, and the variables a and b are left in a neutral state.

Correctness: **True**
