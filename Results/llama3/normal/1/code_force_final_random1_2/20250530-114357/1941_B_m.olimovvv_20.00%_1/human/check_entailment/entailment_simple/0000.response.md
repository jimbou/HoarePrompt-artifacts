Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The key insight here is that the parity of the first and last elements of the array determines whether it is possible to make all elements zero. If the first element is odd, then the second element must be 2 more than the first element, and if the last element is odd, then the second last element must be 2 more than the last element. This is because the operation can only decrease the elements by 1 or 2, and the only way to make an odd element zero is to decrease it by 1 and then by 2.

The program checks these conditions and prints 'NO' if they are not met, and 'YES' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
