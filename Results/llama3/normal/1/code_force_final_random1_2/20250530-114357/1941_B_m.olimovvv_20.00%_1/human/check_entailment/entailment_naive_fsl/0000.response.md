Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, consider the input:

5
1 3 5 5 2

The program will output "YES", but this is incorrect. The correct output should be "NO" because it is not possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the first and last elements of the array can be made equal to zero, but it does not check if the middle elements can be made equal to zero. In this case, the middle elements (3, 5, 5) cannot be made equal to zero using the described operations.

To fix this issue, the program needs to check if all elements of the array can be made equal to zero, not just the first and last elements. This can be done by iterating through the array and checking if each element can be made equal to zero using the described operations.
