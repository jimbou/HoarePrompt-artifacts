The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `input()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_j <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the input must be at least 1 and the _ is 0.
