The only variables in the loop head are variable _ and the input() function, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the input(), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0 and input() is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, _ must be increased by 1, so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again input() must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is an integer greater than 0, and _ is 1 and input() is an integer greater than 1**
