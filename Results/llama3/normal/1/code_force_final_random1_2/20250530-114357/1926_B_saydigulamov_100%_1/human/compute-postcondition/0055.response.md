Output State: **`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is a string that contains the new input string, _ is equal to the previous input integer, stdin is not empty, and the previous input integer is greater than 0. If '1' is in the new input string `b`, then `k` is a list that contains the count of '1' in the new string `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to the new input string, and the value of `k` has been updated accordingly if '1' is in the new input string `b`. The values of `a`, `i`, and the previous input integer `_` remain the same. The 'TRIANGLE' has still been printed, and stdin is still not empty.
