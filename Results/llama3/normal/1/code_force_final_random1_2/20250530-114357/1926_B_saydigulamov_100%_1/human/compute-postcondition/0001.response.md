The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If a is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, a is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
