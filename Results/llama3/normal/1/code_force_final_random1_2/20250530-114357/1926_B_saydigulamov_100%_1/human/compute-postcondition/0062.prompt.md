Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is a string, _ is equal to the input integer minus 1, `k` is an empty list, and stdin is empty. If '1' is in string `b`, then 'TRIANGLE' has been printed.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is a string that contains the input string, _ is equal to the input integer minus 1, stdin is not empty, and input integer is greater than 0. If '1' is in `b`, then `k` is a list that contains the count of '1' in string `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is a string that contains the new input string, _ is equal to the previous input integer, stdin is not empty, and the previous input integer is greater than 0. If '1' is in the new input string `b`, then `k` is a list that contains the count of '1' in the new string `b` plus the previous count of '1' in the new string `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is a string that contains the new input string, `_` is equal to the previous input integer, and stdin is not empty. If '1' is in the new input string `b`, then `k` is a list that contains the count of '1' in the new string `b` plus the previous count of '1' in the new string `b` plus the count of '1' in the current string `b`. If '1' is not in the new input string `b`, then `k` is a list that contains the count of '1' in the new string `b` plus the previous count of '1' in the new string `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
