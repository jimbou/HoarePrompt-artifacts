Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is a string, _ is 2, and stdin contains an integer greater than 2.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to a string, which is the input accepted by the `input()` function. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains an integer greater than 2.
