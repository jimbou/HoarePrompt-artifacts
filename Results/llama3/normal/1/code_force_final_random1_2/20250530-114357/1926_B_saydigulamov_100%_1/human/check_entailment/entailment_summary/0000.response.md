Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly identifies whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. The program works by counting the number of '1's in each row of the grid. If the first two rows have the same count of '1's, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise it prints 'TRIANGLE'. This logic is correct because a square will always have the same number of '1's in each row, while a triangle will have a different number of '1's in each row.

Correctness: **True**
