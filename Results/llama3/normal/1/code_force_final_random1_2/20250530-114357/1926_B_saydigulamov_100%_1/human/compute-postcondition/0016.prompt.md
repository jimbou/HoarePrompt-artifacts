Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains no input. If `b` contains the digit '1', `k` is a list containing one element which is the number of times the digit '1' appears in the integer `b`. Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a string representing a valid integer greater than 0, stdin contains no input. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a string representing a valid integer greater than 0. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `new_input` and the count of '1' in string `b`. Otherwise, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `new_input`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
