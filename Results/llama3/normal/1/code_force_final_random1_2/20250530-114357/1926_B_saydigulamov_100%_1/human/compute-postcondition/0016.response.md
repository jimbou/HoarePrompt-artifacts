Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each string input that contains '1'**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `a` remains greater than 0, the value of `i` remains 0, and the list `k` contains the count of '1' in each string input that contains '1'. The loop has processed all the input strings and has appended the count of '1' in each string to the list `k`.
