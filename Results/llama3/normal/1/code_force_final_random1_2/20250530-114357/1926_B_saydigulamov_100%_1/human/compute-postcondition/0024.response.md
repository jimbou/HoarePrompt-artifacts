The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each string input that contains '1'. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then 'SQUARE' is printed. Otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' is printed.**
