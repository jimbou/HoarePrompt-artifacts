Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases with `a-1` lines each containing `a` characters 0 or 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print('SQUARE')
    else:
        print('TRIANGLE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in each string input that contains '1'. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then 'SQUARE' is printed. Otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is a string, _ is equal to the input integer minus 1, and stdin is empty. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then 'SQUARE' is being printed. Otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' has been printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is a string that contains the last input string, `_` is equal to 0, stdin is empty, and `k` is a list that contains the count of '1' in each input string `b` that contains '1'. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then 'SQUARE' is being printed. Otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
