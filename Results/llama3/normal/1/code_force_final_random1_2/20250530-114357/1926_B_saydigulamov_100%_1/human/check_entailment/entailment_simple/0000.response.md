Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly identifies whether the given grid contains a square or a triangle. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads the grid row by row.
3. It counts the number of '1's in each row and stores them in the list `k`. It only stores the counts for rows that contain at least one '1'.
4. It then checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal. If they are, it prints 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

The reasoning behind this is as follows:

* If the grid contains a square, the number of '1's in each row will be the same, because the square has the same width in each row. Therefore, the first two elements of `k` will be equal.
* If the grid contains a triangle, the number of '1's in each row will increase or decrease by 1 in each row, because the triangle has a different width in each row. Therefore, the first two elements of `k` will not be equal.

The program correctly handles the cases where the grid contains a square or a triangle, and it correctly prints 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
