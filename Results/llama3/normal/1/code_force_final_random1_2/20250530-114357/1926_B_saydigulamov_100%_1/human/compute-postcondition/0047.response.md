The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is a string, _ is equal to the input integer minus 1, and stdin is empty. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then 'SQUARE' is being printed. Otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' has been printed.**
