Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. The condition `if k[0] == k[1]:` is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle. This condition only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal, but it does not check if the number of '1's in each row is consistent with the definition of a square or a triangle.

For example, consider the input:

```
3
000
011
110
```

The program will output "SQUARE", but the correct output should be "TRIANGLE". This is because the number of '1's in each row is not consistent with the definition of a square, but it is consistent with the definition of a triangle.

To correctly identify the shape, the program should check if the number of '1's in each row is consistent with the definition of a square or a triangle. For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be equal to the size of the square. For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should be equal to twice the row number minus one.
