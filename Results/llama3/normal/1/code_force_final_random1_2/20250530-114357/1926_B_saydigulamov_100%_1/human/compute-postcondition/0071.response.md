Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n lines of n characters (0s and 1s). It then analyzes the input strings, counts the occurrences of '1' in each string, and prints 'SQUARE' if the counts in the first two strings are equal, and 'TRIANGLE' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding shape for each case.**
