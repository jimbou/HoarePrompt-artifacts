The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `int(input())`. If `_` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `int(input())` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `int(input())` must be greater than 2.
State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is an integer greater than 1, _ is 2, and `int(input())` is an integer greater than 2**
