Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a string representing a valid integer greater than 0. If '1' is in string `b`, then `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `new_input` and the count of '1' in string `b`. Otherwise, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `new_input`***
