Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `a` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of `n` characters each.
3. It counts the occurrences of '1' in each line and stores them in the list `k`.
4. It checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal. If they are, it prints 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

The reasoning behind this logic is as follows:

* A square will have the same number of '1's in each row, so the first two elements of `k` will be equal.
* A triangle will have a different number of '1's in each row, so the first two elements of `k` will not be equal.

The program correctly implements this logic and prints the correct shape for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
