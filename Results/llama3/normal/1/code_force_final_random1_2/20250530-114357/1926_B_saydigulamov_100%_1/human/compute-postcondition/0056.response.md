Output State: **`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is a string that contains the new input string, _ is equal to the previous input integer, stdin is not empty, the previous input integer is greater than 0, and `k` is a list that contains the count of '1' in the new string `b` plus the previous count of '1' in the new string `b` if '1' is in the new input string `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` is still greater than 2, `i` is still 2, 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is still a string that contains the new input string, _ is still equal to the previous input integer, stdin is still not empty, the previous input integer is still greater than 0. The list `k` now contains the count of '1' in the new string `b` plus the previous count of '1' in the new string `b` if '1' is in the new input string `b`.
