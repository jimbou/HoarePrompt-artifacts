The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of '1' in string `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` is a string representing a valid integer greater than 0, it can contain the digit '1' zero or more times. The count of '1' in `b` is a non-negative integer.

The values of `a` and `i` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a string representing a valid integer greater than 0, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `new_input` and the count of '1' in string `b`.**
