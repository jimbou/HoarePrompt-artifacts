Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10, `i` is equal to `a`, either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is a string that contains the last input string, `_` is equal to 0, stdin is empty, and `k` is a list that contains the count of '1' in each input string `b` that contains '1'. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then 'SQUARE' is being printed. Otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `a` will be within the range of 2 to 10 (inclusive), and the value of `i` will be equal to `a`. The loop will have printed either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' depending on the counts of '1' in the input strings. The variable `b` will hold the last input string, `_` will be 0, and stdin will be empty. The list `k` will contain the counts of '1' in each input string that contains '1'. If the first two elements of `k` are equal, 'SQUARE' will be printed; otherwise, 'TRIANGLE' will be printed.
