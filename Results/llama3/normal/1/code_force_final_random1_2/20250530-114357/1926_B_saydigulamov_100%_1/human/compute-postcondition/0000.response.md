Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases with `a-1` lines each containing `a` characters 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) because it is assigned the value of the first input, which is an integer between 2 and 10. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now has `a-1` lines instead of `a` lines, because one line has been consumed by the `input()` function. Each of the remaining lines still contains `a` characters 0 or 1.
