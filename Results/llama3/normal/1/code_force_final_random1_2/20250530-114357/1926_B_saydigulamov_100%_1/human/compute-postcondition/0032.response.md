Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is an integer greater than 1, and _ is 1 and stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to an integer greater than 1, which is the input provided by the user. The values of `a`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged. The fact that either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' has been printed is still valid. The stdin is now empty since the input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
