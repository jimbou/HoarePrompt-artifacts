Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, 'TRIANGLE' has been printed, `b` is a string that contains the new input string, _ is equal to the previous input integer, stdin is not empty, and the previous input integer is greater than 0. If '1' is in the new input string `b`, then `k` is a list that contains the count of '1' in the new string `b` plus the previous count of '1' in the new string `b`.***
