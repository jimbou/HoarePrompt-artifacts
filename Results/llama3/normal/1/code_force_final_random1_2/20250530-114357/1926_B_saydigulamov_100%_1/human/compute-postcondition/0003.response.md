According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, a is greater than 0, i is 0, and k is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to input is greater than 0.
State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, input is greater than 0**
