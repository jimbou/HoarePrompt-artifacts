Output State: **arr still contains at least one 0, nums is a dictionary with keys as unique elements from arr and values as their respective counts, nums[0] is two less than its original value, nums[1] is two less than its original value, nums[2] is one less than its original value, start is 2, and vis is a set containing 0 and 1.**

The code first decrements the value of `nums[start + 1]` by 1, which means `nums[2]` is now one less than its original value. Then, it increments the value of `start` by 1, making it 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
