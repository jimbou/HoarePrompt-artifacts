Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum score that Alice can achieve in a game where she and Bob take turns picking elements from an array. The score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program uses a Counter object to count the occurrences of each element in the array. It then iterates through the elements, starting from 0, and checks if the current element is present in the Counter. If it is, it decrements the count and moves to the next element. If it is not, it prints the current element plus 1, which is the maximum score that Alice can achieve.

The program also maintains a set of visited elements to keep track of the elements that have been processed.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
