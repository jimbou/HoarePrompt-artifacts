Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers, nums is a dictionary with keys as unique elements from arr and values as their respective counts, start is 0, vis is an empty set**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line creates a dictionary `nums` using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, where the keys are the unique elements from the list `arr` and the values are their respective counts. The second line initializes a variable `start` to 0. The third line creates an empty set `vis`. 

After executing the entire code block, the list `arr` remains unchanged, `nums` is a dictionary with the counts of each unique element in `arr`, `start` is 0, and `vis` is an empty set.
