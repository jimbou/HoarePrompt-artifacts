Postcondition: ***arr still contains at least one 0, nums is a dictionary with keys as unique elements from arr and values as their respective counts, nums[0] is two less than its original value, nums[1] is two less than its original value, nums[2] is two less than its original value, vis is a set containing 0, 1, and 2. If nums.get(start + 1, 0) is true, then nums[start + 1] is one less than its original value and start is 3. Otherwise, the value of start + 1 which is 3 is being printed.***
