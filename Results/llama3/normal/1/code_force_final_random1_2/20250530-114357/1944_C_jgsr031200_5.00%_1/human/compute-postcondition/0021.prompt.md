Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of non-negative integers, nums is a dictionary with keys as unique elements from arr and values as their respective counts, start is 0, vis is an empty set
Code of the loop:
while nums.get(start, 0):
    vis.add(start)
    nums[start] -= 1
    if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
        nums[start + 1] -= 1
        start += 1
    else:
        print(start + 1)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: arr still contains at least one 0, nums is a dictionary with keys as unique elements from arr and values as their respective counts, start is 1, vis is a set containing 0, nums[0] is one less than its original value, and nums[1] is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *arr still contains at least one 0, nums is a dictionary with keys as unique elements from arr and values as their respective counts. If nums.get(start + 1, 0) is true, then nums[0] is two less than its original value, nums[1] is two less than its original value, nums[2] is one less than its original value, start is 2, and vis is a set containing 0 and 1. Otherwise, the value of start + 1 which is equal to 2 is being printed, and the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *arr still contains at least one 0, nums is a dictionary with keys as unique elements from arr and values as their respective counts, nums[0] is two less than its original value, nums[1] is two less than its original value, nums[2] is two less than its original value, vis is a set containing 0, 1, and 2. If nums.get(start + 1, 0) is true, then nums[start + 1] is one less than its original value and start is 3. Otherwise, the value of start + 1 which is 3 is being printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
