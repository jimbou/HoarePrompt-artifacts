Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score while Bob wants to minimize it. The function `func_1` uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n, removing one occurrence of each number and its next number (if it exists) from the counter. The game ends when the counter is empty, and the last number that was removed is the MEX of the array.

The program correctly handles the case where the array contains duplicate numbers, and it also correctly handles the case where the array does not contain all numbers from 0 to n.

The program also correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score. By removing one occurrence of each number and its next number (if it exists), Alice is able to maximize the MEX of the array, which is the score of the game.

Therefore, the program is correct and it will produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
