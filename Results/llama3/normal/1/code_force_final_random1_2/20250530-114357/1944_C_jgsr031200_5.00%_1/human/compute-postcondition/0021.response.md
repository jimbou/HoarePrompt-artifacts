Output State: **nums is a dictionary with keys as unique elements from arr and values as their respective counts, start is equal to the maximum value in arr plus 1, vis is a set containing all elements from 0 to the maximum value in arr, and nums[i] is zero for all i from 0 to the maximum value in arr.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the dictionary `nums` still contains the unique elements from the list `arr` as keys and their respective counts as values. The variable `start` has reached the maximum value in `arr` plus 1, indicating that the loop has traversed all elements in `arr`. The set `vis` contains all elements from 0 to the maximum value in `arr`, indicating that all these elements have been visited during the loop execution. Finally, the values of `nums[i]` are all zero for `i` ranging from 0 to the maximum value in `arr`, indicating that all elements in `arr` have been processed and their counts have been decremented to zero.
