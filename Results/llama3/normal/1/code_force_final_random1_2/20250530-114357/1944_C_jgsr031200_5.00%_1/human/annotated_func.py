#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: nums is a dictionary with keys as unique elements from arr and values as their respective counts, start is equal to the maximum value in arr plus 1, vis is a set containing all elements from 0 to the maximum value in arr, and nums[i] is zero for all i from 0 to the maximum value in arr.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: the maximum value in arr plus 1

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the maximum value in a given list of non-negative integers and prints the maximum value plus one. It also modifies the input list by creating a dictionary of unique elements and their counts, and a set of all elements from 0 to the maximum value. The function returns no value but prints the maximum value plus one.
