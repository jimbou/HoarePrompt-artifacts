Postcondition: ***arr still contains at least one 0, nums is a dictionary with keys as unique elements from arr and values as their respective counts. If nums.get(start + 1, 0) is true, then nums[0] is two less than its original value, nums[1] is two less than its original value, nums[2] is one less than its original value, start is 2, and vis is a set containing 0 and 1. Otherwise, the value of start + 1 which is equal to 2 is being printed, and the state of the variables remains the same as in the precondition.***
