The only variable in the loop head is variable start and nums, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable nums.get(start, 0).  If nums.get(start, 0) is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nums[0] is one less than its original value, and nums[1] is one less than its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time, nums[1] needs to be greater than 0.
State: **arr still contains at least one 0, nums is a dictionary with keys as unique elements from arr and values as their respective counts, start is 1, vis is a set containing 0, nums[0] is one less than its original value, and nums[1] is greater than 0**
