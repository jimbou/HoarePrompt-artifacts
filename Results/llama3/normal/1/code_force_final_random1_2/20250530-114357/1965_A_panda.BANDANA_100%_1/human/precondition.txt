stdin contains t test cases, each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n space-separated integers. t, n and all the integers are positive integers, 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
