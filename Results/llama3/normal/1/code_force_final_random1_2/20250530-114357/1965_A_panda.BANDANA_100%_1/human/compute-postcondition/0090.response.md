Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers.**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line maps the input to a list of integers and assigns it to `l`. The third line sorts the unique elements of `l` and assigns the result to `lis`. 

Since `t` and `i` are not affected by the code, their values remain the same. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input. The value of `lis` is updated to a sorted list of unique integers from the input. 

Note that the code does not modify the value of `t` or `i`, so their values remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input, and the value of `lis` is updated to a sorted list of unique integers from the input.
