Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, j is 1. If the difference between the second element of lis and the first element of lis is greater than 1, then test is set to False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
