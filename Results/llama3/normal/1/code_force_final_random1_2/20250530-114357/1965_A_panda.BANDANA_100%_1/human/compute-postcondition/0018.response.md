Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers, 1 is in `lis`, the length of `lis` is more than 1, `j` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `lis` and the first element of `lis` is greater than 1, then `test` is set to False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
