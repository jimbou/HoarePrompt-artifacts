To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `lis`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The loop iterates over a range starting from 1 to the length of `lis`. For the loop to execute, `lis` must have at least two elements, so its length must be at least 2.
2. Since `j` is the loop variable, it will take values from 1 to `len(lis) - 1`. For the loop to execute, `j` should start with the first value in this range, which is 1.


Now, let's adjust the states accordingly:


State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, `test` is True, `j` is 1**
