Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 3 elements, `j` is 3. If the difference between the third and second elements of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is False and 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
