Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers. If 1 is not in lis or the length of lis is 1, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if test is True, then 'Alice' is printed if the length of lis is odd, otherwise 'Bob' is printed. If test is False, no printing occurs.***
