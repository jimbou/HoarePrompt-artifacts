The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers. If 1 is not in `lis` or `lis` contains only one element, then 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, `j` is equal to the length of `lis`. If there are no pairs of adjacent elements in `lis` with a difference greater than 1, then either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed, depending on whether the length of `lis` is odd or even. If there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in `lis` with a difference greater than 1, then either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed, depending on whether the index of the first pair of adjacent elements with a difference greater than 1 is odd or even.**
