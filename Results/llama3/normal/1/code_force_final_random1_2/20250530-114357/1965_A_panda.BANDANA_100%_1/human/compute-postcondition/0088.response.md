Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers. If 1 is not in lis or lis contains only one element, then 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, j is equal to the length of lis. If there are no pairs of adjacent elements in lis with a difference greater than 1, then either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed, depending on whether the length of lis is odd or even. If there is at least one pair of adjacent elements in lis with a difference greater than 1, then either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed, depending on whether the index of the first pair of adjacent elements with a difference greater than 1 is odd or even.***
