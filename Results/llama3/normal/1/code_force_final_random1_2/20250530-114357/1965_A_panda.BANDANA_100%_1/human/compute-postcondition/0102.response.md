Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is True, `j` is 1. The current value of `lis[j] - lis[j - 1]` is greater than 1. If `j` is an odd number, 'Bob' is being printed. If `j` is an even number, 'Alice' is being printed.***
