Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers, 1 is in lis, the length of lis is more than 1, j is equal to the length of lis minus 1. If the difference between any two consecutive elements of lis is greater than 1, then either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed, depending on whether the index of the second element is odd or even. The current value of test is True.**
