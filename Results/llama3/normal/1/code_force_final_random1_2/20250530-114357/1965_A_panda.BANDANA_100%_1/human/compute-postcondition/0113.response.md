To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, len(lis)):`. This means that the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than the length of `lis`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, and `lis` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3.

Since `lis` has at least 3 elements, and `j` is now 3, the loop can execute again if `lis` has at least 4 elements.

The other variables in the state (`t`, `i`, `n`, `test`) are not affected by the loop head, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 4 elements, `test` is False, `j` is 3**
