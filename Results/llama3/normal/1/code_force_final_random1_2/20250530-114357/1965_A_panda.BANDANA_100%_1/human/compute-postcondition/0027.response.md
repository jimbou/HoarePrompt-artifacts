The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and lis, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and the length of the list lis. If j is less than the length of the list lis, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 2, lis has a length of at least 3. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1 and lis must have a length of at least 4.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers with a length of at least 4, 1 is in lis, j is 3**
