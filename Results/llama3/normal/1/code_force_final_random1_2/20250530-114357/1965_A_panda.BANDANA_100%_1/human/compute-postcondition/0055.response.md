Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, `test` is True. The current value of `j` is 1 and the difference between the element at index `j` and the element before it in `lis` is greater than 1. Additionally, the current value of `j` is odd (i.e., `j` modulo 2 equals 1), and 'Bob' is printed**
