To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables accordingly.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, len(lis)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the length of the list `lis`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `lis` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `lis` must have at least 3 elements.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `t` remains an integer greater than 1 (no change)
* `i` remains 1 (no change)
* `n` remains an integer (no change)
* `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 3 elements
* `j` is 2

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 3 elements, `j` is 2**
