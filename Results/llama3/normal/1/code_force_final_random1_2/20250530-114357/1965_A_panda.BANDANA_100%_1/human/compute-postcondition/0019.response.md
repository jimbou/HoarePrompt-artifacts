To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, len(lis)):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `j` and `lis`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than the length of `lis`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and the length of `lis` is more than 1.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `j` by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The length of `lis` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it is at least 3, so that the loop can execute again.

The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `test` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers with a length of at least 3, 1 is in `lis`, `j` is 2, `test` is False (if the difference between the second element of `lis` and the first element of `lis` is greater than 1) or unchanged (otherwise)**
