Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers, `test` is True**

The code assigns the value True to the variable `test`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `lis`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `test` with the value True, and the unchanged values of the other variables.
