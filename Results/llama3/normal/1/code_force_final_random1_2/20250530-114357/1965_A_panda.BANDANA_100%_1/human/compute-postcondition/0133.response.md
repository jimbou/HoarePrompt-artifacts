Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes t test cases, and determines the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the given conditions. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a list of n integers, removes duplicates, and sorts the list. If the list contains only one element or does not contain 1, it prints 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks for gaps in the list and prints 'Bob' if a gap is found at an odd index or 'Alice' if a gap is found at an even index. If no gaps are found, it prints 'Alice' if the length of the list is odd and 'Bob' if the length is even.**
