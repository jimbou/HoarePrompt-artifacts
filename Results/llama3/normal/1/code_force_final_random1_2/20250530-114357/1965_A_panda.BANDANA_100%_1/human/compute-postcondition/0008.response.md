According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lis`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `test` is True, and `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers, 1 is in `lis`, the length of `lis` is more than 1. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 2 elements and the `j` is 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers, 1 is in `lis`, the length of `lis` is more than 1, `test` is True, `j` is 1**
