Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers, 1 is in `lis`, the length of `lis` is more than 1, and `test` is True.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `lis` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `test` which is assigned the value `True`.
