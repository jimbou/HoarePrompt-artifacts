The code snippet consists of two lines: `test = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `test`, which was previously `True`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed within. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state.

Considering the initial state and the effects of the code snippet, the final state is as follows:

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, test is False, j is 1.**
