Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers. If 1 is not in lis or the length of lis is 1, then 'Alice' is printed. If 1 is in lis and the length of lis is more than 1, then either 'Bob' or 'Alice' is printed depending on whether the difference between any two consecutive elements of lis is greater than 1 and the index of the second element is odd or even, or whether the length of lis is odd or even and test is True. If test is False, no additional action is taken.***
