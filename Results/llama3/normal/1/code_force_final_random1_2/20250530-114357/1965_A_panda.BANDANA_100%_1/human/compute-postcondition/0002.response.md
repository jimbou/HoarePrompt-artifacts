Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers**

In this code block, the first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line maps the input (a space-separated list of integers) to a list of integers, which is then assigned to `l`. The third line sorts the unique elements of `l` (obtained using the `set` function) and assigns the result to `lis`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
