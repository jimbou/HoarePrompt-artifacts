Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, lis is a sorted list of unique integers with a length of at least 4, 1 is in lis, j is 3. If lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1, then test is False. If j is odd, 'Bob' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is being printed. If lis[j] - lis[j - 1] is not greater than 1, then no changes are made.***
