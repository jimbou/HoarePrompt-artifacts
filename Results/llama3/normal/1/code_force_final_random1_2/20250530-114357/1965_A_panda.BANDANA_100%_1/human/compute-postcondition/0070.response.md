To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop condition. The loop head is `for j in range(1, len(lis)):`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(lis)`. Since `lis` has at least 3 elements, `len(lis)` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, making it 3.

The other variables in the loop head are `lis`, but its state does not need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on the length of `lis`, which is not changed by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 3 elements, `j` is 3. If the difference between the second and first elements of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is False. If `j` is odd, 'Bob' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is being printed.**
