According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lis`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers, and `test` is True. However, these states do not ensure that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head.

The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and list `lis`, so we can only adjust those ones. For the loop to execute, the list `lis` must have at least 2 elements, and `j` is 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is True, `j` is 1**
