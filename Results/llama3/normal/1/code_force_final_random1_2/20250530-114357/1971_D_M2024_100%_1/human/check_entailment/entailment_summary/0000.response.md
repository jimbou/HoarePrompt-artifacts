Reasoning: 
The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. It counts the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the binary string, which represents the minimum number of cuts needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. The program also handles the edge case where the string starts with '0' by adding 1 to the total number of transitions. This is because in this case, the first '0' needs to be cut and rearranged to the beginning of the string.

Correctness: **True**
