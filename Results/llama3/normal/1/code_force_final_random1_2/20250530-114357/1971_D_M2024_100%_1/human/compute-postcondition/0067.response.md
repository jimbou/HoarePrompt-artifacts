Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `i` is 1, `cut0` is increased by 1, if `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is increased by 1, otherwise `cut1` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut0` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cut1` is still dependent on the values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]`. The input in `stdin` and the values of `t`, `_`, `a`, and `i` are not affected by the code.
