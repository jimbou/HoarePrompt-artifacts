Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), as the first input (the integer t) has been consumed.
