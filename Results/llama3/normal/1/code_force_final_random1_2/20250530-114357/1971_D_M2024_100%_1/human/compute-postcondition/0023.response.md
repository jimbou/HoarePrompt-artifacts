The code prints the value of `cut1 + 1`, where `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`. Since `cut1` is an integer, adding 1 to it will result in another integer.

Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is `len(a) - 1`, the current value of `cut0` is 0, and `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`, and the value of `cut1 + 1` is being printed**
