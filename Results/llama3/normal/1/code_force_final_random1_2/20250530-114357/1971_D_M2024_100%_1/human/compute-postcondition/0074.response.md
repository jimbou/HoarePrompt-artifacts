Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a`, and `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over the entire string `a`, and the variables `cut0` and `cut1` have been updated to reflect the number of times '0' is followed by '1' and '1' is followed by '0' in the string, respectively. The variable `i` has reached the end of the string, and the other variables remain unchanged.
