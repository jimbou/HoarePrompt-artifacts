Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly counts the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in each binary string, which is equivalent to the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the string into so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program uses two counters, `cut0` and `cut1`, to count the number of times '0' is followed by '1' and '1' is followed by '0', respectively. If `cut0` is 0, it means that the string starts with '0' and does not contain any '1's, so the program prints `cut1 + 1`, which is the total number of transitions plus one. Otherwise, the program prints the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`, which is the total number of transitions.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. It also correctly handles the edge case where the string starts with '0' and does not contain any '1's.

Correctness: **True**
