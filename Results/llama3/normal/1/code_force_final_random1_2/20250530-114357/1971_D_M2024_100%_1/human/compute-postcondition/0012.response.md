Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `i` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `cut1` and `cut0` remain unchanged.***
