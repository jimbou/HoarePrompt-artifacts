Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ was 1, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 4, i is len(a) - 1, cut1 is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut1` is increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still between 2 and 500, the stdin still contains t-2 strings of '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500, the value of `_` is still 1, the string `a` still consists of '0' and '1' with length at least 4, and the value of `i` is still equal to the length of `a` minus 1.
