To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(a) - 1` is at least 1, meaning `a` must have at least 2 characters. Since `i` is already set to `len(a) - 1`, we need to adjust `a` to have at least 2 characters.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is 1, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, i is len(a) - 1, cut0 is 0, cut1 is 0**
