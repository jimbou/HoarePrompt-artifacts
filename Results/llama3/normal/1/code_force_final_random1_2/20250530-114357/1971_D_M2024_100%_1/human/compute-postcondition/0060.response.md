Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `i` is 0, if the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is 1 and `cut0` is 0. Otherwise, `cut1` and `cut0` remain unchanged.***
