The code prints the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`, where `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in string `a` and `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in string `a`. Since `cut0` is not equal to 0, it means there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in string `a`. The exact value of `cut0 + cut1` depends on the specific string `a` and its contents.

Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in `a`, and `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in `a`. `cut0` is not equal to 0, and the sum of `cut0` and `cut1` is printed**
