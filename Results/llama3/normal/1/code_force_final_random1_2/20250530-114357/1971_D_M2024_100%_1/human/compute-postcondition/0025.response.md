The code prints the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`, where `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in the string `a`, and `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`. Since `cut0` is not equal to 0, we know that there is at least one occurrence of '0' followed by '1' in the string `a`. However, we cannot determine the exact value of `cut1` or the sum `cut0 + cut1` without knowing the exact string `a`.

Output: **the sum of the number of times '0' is followed by '1' and the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string a**
