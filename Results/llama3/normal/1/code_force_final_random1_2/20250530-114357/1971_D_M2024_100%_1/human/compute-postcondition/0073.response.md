Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is '0' and `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is increased by 1 and `cut1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cut0` and `cut1` remain unchanged.***
