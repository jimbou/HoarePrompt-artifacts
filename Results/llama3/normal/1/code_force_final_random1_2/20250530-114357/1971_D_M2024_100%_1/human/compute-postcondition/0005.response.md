Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `cut0` is 0, `cut1` is 1, `i` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The input strings in stdin are still present, and the string `a` still has at least 2 characters, with the current character at index `i` being '1' and the next character at index `i + 1` being '0'.
