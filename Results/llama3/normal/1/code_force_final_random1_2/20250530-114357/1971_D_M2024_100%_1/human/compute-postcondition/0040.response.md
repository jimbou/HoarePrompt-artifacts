Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ was 1, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, i is len(a) - 1. If the current value of a[i] is '1' and the current value of a[i + 1] is '0', then cut0 is 2 and cut1 is 2. Otherwise, cut0 is 1 and cut1 is 1.**

In this output state, the value of cut0 has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for cut0 and cut1 are still dependent on the values of a[i] and a[i + 1].
