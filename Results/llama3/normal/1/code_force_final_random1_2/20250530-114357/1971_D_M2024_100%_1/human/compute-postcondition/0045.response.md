Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ was 1, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 4, i is len(a) - 1. If a[i] is '1' and a[i + 1] is '0', then cut1 is increased by 1, cut0 is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of cut0 has been incremented by 1. The other variables, such as t, stdin, _, a, i, and cut1, remain unchanged.
