Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is `len(a) - 1`. If `cut0` is 0, the value of `cut1 + 1` is printed. Otherwise, the sum of `cut0` and `cut1` is printed.**
