Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `i` is 1, `cut1` is increased by 1, `cut0` remains unchanged**

In this output state, the value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The range of `t` and the length of the strings in `stdin` are still the same. The values of `_`, `a`, `i`, and `cut0` are also unchanged.
