Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `i` is 1, `cut1` is 1, and if the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', then `cut0` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cut1` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions. The stdin still contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The values of `cut0` and the conditional statement related to `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]` remain the same as in the initial state.
