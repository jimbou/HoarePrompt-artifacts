The code prints the value of `cut1` plus 1. `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`. Since the exact string `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cut1`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`, plus 1.
Output: **cut1 + 1 (where cut1 is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string a)**
