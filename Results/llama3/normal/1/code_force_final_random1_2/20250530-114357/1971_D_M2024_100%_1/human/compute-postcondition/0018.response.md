Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, `i` is 2, `cut0` is 1 plus its previous value. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut1` is 1 plus its previous value, otherwise `cut1` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `cut1` also remain the same, depending on the values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]`.
