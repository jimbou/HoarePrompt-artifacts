Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ was 1, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, i was len(a) - 1, cut0 was 0, cut1 was 1. The current value of a[i] is '1' and the current value of a[i + 1] is '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut1` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The input in stdin remains unchanged, consisting of t-2 strings of '0's and '1's. The string `a` still has a length of at least 2, with `a[i]` being '1' and `a[i + 1]` being '0'. The value of `i` is still `len(a) - 1`, and `cut0` is still 0.
