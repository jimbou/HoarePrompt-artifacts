Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `i` is 0, `cut1` is 0, `cut0` is 1. The current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The current character at index `i` in string `a` is '0' and the next character at index `i+1` is '1'. The number of test cases `t` is still between 1 and 500, and there are still `t-1` strings in the standard input, each consisting of '0's and '1's with length between 1 and 500. The variable `_` is still 0, and `cut1` is still 0.
