To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter, and `t`, which is the upper limit of the range.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).

The other variables `stdin`, `a`, `i`, `cut0`, and `cut1` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is `len(a) - 1`**
