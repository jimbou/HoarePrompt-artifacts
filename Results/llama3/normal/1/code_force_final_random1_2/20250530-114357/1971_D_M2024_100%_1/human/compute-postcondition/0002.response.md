Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is 0, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), cut0 is 0, cut1 is 0**

The code reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `a`, reducing the number of strings in stdin by 1. The initial state of `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and the length of each string in stdin is between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The code does not modify the value of `t` or the length of the strings in stdin. The variables `cut0` and `cut1` are initialized to 0 and remain unchanged. The value of `_` is 0 and remains unchanged.
