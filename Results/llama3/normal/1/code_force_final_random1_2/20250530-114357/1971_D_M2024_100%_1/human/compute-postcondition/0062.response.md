Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-4` strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, `i` is 0, `cut1` is 0, `cut0` is 1, the current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `cut0` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cut0` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `a[i]` is still '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is still '1'.
