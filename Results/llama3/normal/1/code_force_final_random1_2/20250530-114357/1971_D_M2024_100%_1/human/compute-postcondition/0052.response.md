The code prints the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`, where `cut0` is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in the string `a`, and `cut1` is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string `a`. Since `cut0` is larger than 0, the sum will be at least 1.

Output: **the sum of the number of times '0' is followed by '1' and the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in the string a**
