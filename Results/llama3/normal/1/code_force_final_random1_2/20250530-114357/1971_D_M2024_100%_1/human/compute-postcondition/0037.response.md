The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `a` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least 3 characters.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ was 1, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, i is len(a) - 1. If the current value of a[i] is '0' and the current value of a[i + 1] is '1', then cut0 is 1 and cut1 is 1. Otherwise, cut0 is 0 and cut1 is 1.**
