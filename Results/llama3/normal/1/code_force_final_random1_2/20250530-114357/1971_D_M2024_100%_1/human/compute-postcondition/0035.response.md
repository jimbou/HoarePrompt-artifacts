Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ was 1, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 2, i was len(a) - 1, cut0 is 1, cut1 is 1.**

The value of `cut0` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The current value of `a[i]` is '0' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '1', but this does not change the value of `cut1` because the condition for changing `cut1` is not met. Therefore, the output state is as described above.
