Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ was 1, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length at least 3, i is len(a) - 1. If the current value of a[i] is '1' and the current value of a[i + 1] is '0', then cut0 is 1 and cut1 is 2. Otherwise, cut0 is 0 and cut1 is 1.***
