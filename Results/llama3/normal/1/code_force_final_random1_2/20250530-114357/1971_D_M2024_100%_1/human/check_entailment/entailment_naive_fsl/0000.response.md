Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program works by iterating through the string and counting the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' (cut1) and the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' (cut0). If cut0 is 0, it means that the string is already sorted in the order '1's followed by '0's, so the program prints cut1 + 1. Otherwise, it prints cut0 + cut1.

This logic is correct because the minimum number of pieces needed is equal to the number of times the string needs to be cut to separate the '1's and '0's, plus one (because the last piece does not need to be cut). The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the string is already sorted.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
