Output State: **t is an integer equal to 0, stdin contains 0 strings, _ is t, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is -1, cut0 is the number of times '0' is followed by '1' in a, cut1 is the number of times '1' is followed by '0' in a. If cut0 is 0, the value of cut1 + 1 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of cut0 and cut1 (the total number of cuts in string a) is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be equal to 0, indicating that all strings from the input have been processed. The variable `_` will also be equal to `t`, which is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable `a` will still be a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), but it will be the last string processed by the loop. The variable `i` will be -1, indicating that the inner loop has finished executing. The variables `cut0` and `cut1` will hold the counts of '0' followed by '1' and '1' followed by '0' in the last string `a`, respectively. If `cut0` is 0, the value of `cut1 + 1` will be printed, otherwise, the sum of `cut0` and `cut1` (the total number of cuts in string `a`) will be printed.
