The first line assigns a string from stdin to `a`. Since stdin contains `t-1` strings, it now contains `t-2` strings. The second line assigns 0 to `cut0`. The third line assigns 0 to `cut1`. The fourth line does not affect any variables.

Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 strings, each consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), _ is 1, a is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length between 1 and 500 (inclusive), i is len(a) - 1, cut0 is 0, cut1 is 0**
