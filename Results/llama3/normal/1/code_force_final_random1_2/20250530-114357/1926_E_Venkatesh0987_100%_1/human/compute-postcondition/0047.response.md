The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the input value, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and the input value is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 2, s is either 0 or greater than or equal to k, i is an integer greater than or equal to 0, d is either 0 or n, h is either 0 or n, p is either i or 1, g is either n or 0, f is either -n + k or undefined, and y is either undefined or 2^(i - 1) * (2 * (-n + k) - 1)**
