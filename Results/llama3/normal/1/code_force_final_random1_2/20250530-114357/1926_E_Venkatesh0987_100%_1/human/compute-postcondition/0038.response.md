Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 1, s is greater than or equal to k, i is at least 4, d is 0, h is (n + 1) // 4 - (h + 1) // 2, p is 4, g is (3n + 3) // 4 + (h + 1) // 2, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

The code modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by the value of `(h + 1) // 2`, which is half of `h` plus one, rounded down. The second line decrements `h` by the same value, effectively reducing it by half and rounding down. The third line simply increments `p` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
