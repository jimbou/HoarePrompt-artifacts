Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 0, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). If k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, then s is greater than k and greater than its original value by d, i is the smallest integer greater than log2(n), d is 0, h is -1, p is i, g is (n + 1) // 2 + (n - 1) // 4 + (n - 1) // 8 + ... + (n - 1) // 2^(i - 1), f is k - g, y is 2, and the value of y which is 2 is being printed. Otherwise, if k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then 2 times k minus 1 is printed, where k is an integer between 1 and n.**
