Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 1, s is greater than or equal to k, i is an integer greater than 0, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, f is -n + k, y is 2^(i - 1) * (2 * (-n + k) - 1), stdin contains t - 2 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
