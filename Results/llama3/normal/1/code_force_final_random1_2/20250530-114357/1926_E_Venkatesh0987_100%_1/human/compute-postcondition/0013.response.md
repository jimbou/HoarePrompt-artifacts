Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n and greater than (n + 1) // 2, _ is 0, s is greater than k and greater than its original value by d, i is greater than 2, d is 0, h is 0, p is 3, g is (n + 1) // 2 + (n - 1) // 4, stdin contains t - i - 1 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
