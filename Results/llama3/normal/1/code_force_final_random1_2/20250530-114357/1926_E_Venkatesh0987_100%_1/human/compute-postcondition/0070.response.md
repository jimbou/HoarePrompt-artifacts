Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 2. If k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, then s is k, i is the ceiling of log2(n), d is 0, h is 0, p is the ceiling of log2(n), g is n, f is k - n, and the value of y which is 2^(i-1) * (2 * (k - n) - 1) is being printed. If k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, f is undefined, and y is undefined, and 2 * k - 1 is being printed.***
