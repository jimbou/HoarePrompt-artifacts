Based on the precondition, we know that `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. This means that `k` is at most half of `n`.

The print statement is `print(2 * k - 1)`. To evaluate this expression, we need to multiply `k` by 2 and then subtract 1.

Since `k` is at most half of `n`, we know that `2 * k` is at most `n`. Subtracting 1 from this value gives us a value that is at most `n - 1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be an odd integer between 1 and `n - 1`.

Output: **an odd integer between 1 and n - 1**
