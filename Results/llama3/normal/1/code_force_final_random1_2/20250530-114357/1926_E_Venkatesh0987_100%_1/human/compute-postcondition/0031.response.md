Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than max(3 * n // 2 - 1, 2k - 1, 1), k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 1, s is (n + 1) // 2 + (n - 1) // 4 + (d + 1) // 2, i is 3, d is (n - 1) // 4 - (d + 1) // 2, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t - 4 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

The code modifies the values of `s`, `i`, and `d`. The first line increments `s` by the value of `(d + 1) // 2`, which is half of `d + 1`. The second line decrements `d` by the value of `(d + 1) // 2`, effectively reducing `d` by half. The third line increments `i` by 1. No other variables are affected.
