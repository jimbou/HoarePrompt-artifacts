To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `s < k and d > 0`.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9
- `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` and greater than `(n + 1) // 2`
- `_` is 0
- `s` is 0
- `i` is 0
- The current value of `d` is `n`
- The current value of `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `stdin` contains `t` inputs: two space-separated integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)

We focus on the variables in the loop condition: `s` and `d`.

1. For `s < k` to be true, given that `s` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0. Since `k` is already defined as an integer between 1 and `n` and greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, this condition is inherently satisfied.

2. For `d > 0` to be true, given that the current value of `d` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is defined as an integer between 1 and 10^9, this condition is also inherently satisfied.

Given these considerations, the initial states provided already ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed without needing any adjustments to the states of `s` and `d`. Therefore, the state remains as initially described.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` and greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, `_` is 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `d` is `n`, the current value of `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `stdin` contains `t` inputs: two space-separated integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
