Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is t, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, which represents the number of iterations. The variables `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` will be reset to their initial values, which are 0, 0, `n`, `n`, 1, and 0, respectively. The values of `n` and `k` will remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
