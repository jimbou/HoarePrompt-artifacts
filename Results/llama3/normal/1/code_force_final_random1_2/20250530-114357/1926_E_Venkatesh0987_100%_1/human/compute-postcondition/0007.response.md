To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `s` and `d` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `s` is less than `k` and `d` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is less than `k` and greater than its original value by `(d + 1) // 2`, and `d` is greater than 0 and less than its original value by `(d + 1) // 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `s` is still less than `k` and `d` is still greater than 0. Since `s` is already less than `k`, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to adjust the state of `d` to ensure it is still greater than 0.

Since `d` is less than its original value by `(d + 1) // 2`, we can conclude that the original value of `d` must be greater than 1. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `d` to be greater than 1.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n and greater than (n + 1) // 2, _ is 0, s is less than k and greater than its original value by (d + 1) // 2, i is 2, d is greater than 1 and less than its original value by (d + 1) // 2, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
