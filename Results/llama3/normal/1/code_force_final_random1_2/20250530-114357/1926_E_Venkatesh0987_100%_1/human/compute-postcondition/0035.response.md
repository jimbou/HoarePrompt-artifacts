According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 2, `i` is at least 2. `i` being at least 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is at least 3.

State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 1, s is greater than or equal to k, i is at least 3, d is 0, h is (n + 1) // 2, p is 2, g is (n + 1) // 2, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
