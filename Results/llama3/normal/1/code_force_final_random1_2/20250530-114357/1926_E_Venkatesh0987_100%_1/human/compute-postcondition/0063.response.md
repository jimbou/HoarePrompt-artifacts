Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 2, s is k, i is the ceiling of log2(n), d is 0, h is 0, p is the ceiling of log2(n), g is n, f is undefined, and y is undefined**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of t, n, k, _, s, d, and f remain unchanged. The value of i is still the ceiling of log2(n), indicating that the loop has executed log2(n) times. The value of h is 0, indicating that the loop has reduced the value of h to 0. The value of p is now equal to the ceiling of log2(n), indicating that the loop has executed log2(n) times. The value of g is now equal to n, indicating that the loop has added n to g.
