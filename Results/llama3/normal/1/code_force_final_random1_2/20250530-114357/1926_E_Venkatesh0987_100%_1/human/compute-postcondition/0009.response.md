Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n and greater than (n + 1) // 2, _ is 0, s is greater than k and greater than its original value by d, i is the smallest integer greater than log2(n), d is 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t - i inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `s` is greater than `k` and has increased by the original value of `d`, `i` is the smallest integer greater than the base-2 logarithm of `n`, and `d` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
