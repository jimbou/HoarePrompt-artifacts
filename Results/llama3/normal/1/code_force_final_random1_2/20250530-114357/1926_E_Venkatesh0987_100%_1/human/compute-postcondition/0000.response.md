The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains t+1 inputs: the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), and the remaining t inputs are two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
