Output State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 2, s is k, i is the ceiling of log2(n), d is 0, h is 0, p is the ceiling of log2(n), g is n, f is undefined, and y is undefined

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that t, n, k, _, s, d, f, and y remain unchanged. The value of i is the ceiling of log2(n), which is the same as the initial state. The value of h is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of p is the ceiling of log2(n), which is the same as the value of i. The value of g is n, indicating that the loop has added up all the values from 1 to n.
