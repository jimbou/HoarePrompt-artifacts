To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `while p <= i - 1:`. This condition depends on the values of `p` and `i`.

Right before the loop, `p` is 1, and `i` is the number of iterations. For the loop to execute at least once, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`. Given that `p` is 1, we need `i` to be at least 2 for the condition to be true.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `i`, which must be at least 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 1, s is greater than or equal to k, i must be at least 2, d is 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
