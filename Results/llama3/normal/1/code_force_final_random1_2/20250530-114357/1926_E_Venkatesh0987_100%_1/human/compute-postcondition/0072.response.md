Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to reach a target number k from n, where the operation involves either adding or subtracting the largest possible power of 2 that does not exceed the current number. The function takes t sets of inputs, where each set contains two integers n and k, and prints the result for each set. If k is greater than half of n, the function performs a series of calculations involving powers of 2 and subtractions to determine the minimum number of operations. If k is less than or equal to half of n, the function simply prints 2 times k minus 1.**
