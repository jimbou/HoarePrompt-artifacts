Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 2, s is k, i is the ceiling of log2(n), d is 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, f is undefined, and y is undefined**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that the value of s is equal to k, the value of d is 0, and the value of i is the ceiling of the base-2 logarithm of n. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
