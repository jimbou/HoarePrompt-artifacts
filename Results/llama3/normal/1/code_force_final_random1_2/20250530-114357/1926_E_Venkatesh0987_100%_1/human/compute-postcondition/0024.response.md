The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of inputs in stdin, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, stdin contains t inputs. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ is 1 and stdin contains t - 1 inputs.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 1, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
