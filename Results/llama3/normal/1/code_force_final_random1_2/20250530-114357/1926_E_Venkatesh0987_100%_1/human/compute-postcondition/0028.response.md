To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `s` and `d`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `s` is less than `k` and `d` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2` and `d` is `(n - 1) // 2`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `s` to be less than `k` and `d` to be greater than 0.

Since `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`, we can adjust `n` to be greater than `2k - 1` to ensure `s` is less than `k`. This is because if `n` is greater than `2k - 1`, then `(n + 1) // 2` will be less than `k`.

Similarly, since `d` is `(n - 1) // 2`, we can adjust `n` to be greater than 1 to ensure `d` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than max(2k - 1, 1), `k` is an integer between 1 and n, `_` is 1, `s` is (n + 1) // 2, `i` is 1, `d` is (n - 1) // 2, `h` is n, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, stdin contains t - 3 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
