Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n and greater than (n + 1) // 2, _ is 0, s is greater than k and greater than its original value by d, i is the smallest integer greater than log2(n), d is 0, h is -1, p is i, g is (n + 1) // 2 + (n - 1) // 4 + (n - 1) // 8 + ... + (n - 1) // 2^(i - 1), stdin contains t - i inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that the value of `p` is equal to `i`, which is the smallest integer greater than `log2(n)`. The value of `h` is `-1`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `g` is the sum of the first `i` terms of the sequence `(n + 1) // 2, (n - 1) // 4, (n - 1) // 8, ..., (n - 1) // 2^(i - 1)`, which represents the total number of iterations of the loop. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
