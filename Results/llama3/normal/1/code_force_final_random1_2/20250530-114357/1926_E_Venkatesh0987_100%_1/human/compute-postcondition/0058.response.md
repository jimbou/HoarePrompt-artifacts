According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 2 and `i` is greater than 1. `i` being greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 2, s is k, i is greater than 2, d is 0, h is (n+1)//2, p is 2, g is (n+1)//2, f is undefined, and y is undefined**
