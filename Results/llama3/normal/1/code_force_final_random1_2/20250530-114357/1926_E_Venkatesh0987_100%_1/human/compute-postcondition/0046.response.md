Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 1. If k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, then s is greater than or equal to k, i is an integer greater than 0, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, f is -n + k, and y is 2^(i - 1) * (2 * (-n + k) - 1) is being printed. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, and 2 times k minus 1 is being printed.**
