The variables in the loop head are `p` and `i`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `p <= i - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 3 and `i` is greater than 2. Since `p` is already 3, it cannot be adjusted further. However, `i` being greater than 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than 3.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 2, s is k, i is greater than 3, d is 0, h is 0, p is 3, g is n + 1, f is undefined, and y is undefined**
