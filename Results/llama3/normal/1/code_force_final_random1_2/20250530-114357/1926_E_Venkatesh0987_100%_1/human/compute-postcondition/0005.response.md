The variables in the loop head are s and d, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables s and d. If s is less than k and d is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is (n + 1) // 2, k is between 1 and n and greater than (n + 1) // 2, and d is (n - 1) // 2. For the loop to execute again, s must be less than k, so s must be less than k. Also, d must be greater than 0, so d must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n and greater than (n + 1) // 2, _ is 0, s is less than k, i is 1, d is greater than 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
