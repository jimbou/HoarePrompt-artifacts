Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n and greater than (n + 1) // 2, _ is 0, s is greater than k and greater than its original value by d, i is 3, d is 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

The code modifies the values of `s`, `d`, and `i`. The first line increments `s` by `(d + 1) // 2`, making `s` greater than `k` and greater than its original value by `d`. The second line decrements `d` by `(d + 1) // 2`, making `d` equal to 0. The third line increments `i` by 1, making `i` equal to 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
