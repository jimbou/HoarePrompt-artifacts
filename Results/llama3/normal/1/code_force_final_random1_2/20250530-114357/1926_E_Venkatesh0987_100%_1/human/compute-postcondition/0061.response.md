The code snippet modifies the values of `g`, `h`, and `p`. The first line increments `g` by the integer division of `h + 1` by 2. Since `h` is initially 0, `h + 1` equals 1, and the integer division of 1 by 2 equals 0. Therefore, `g` remains unchanged.

The second line decrements `h` by the integer division of `h + 1` by 2. As explained earlier, `h + 1` equals 1, and the integer division of 1 by 2 equals 0. Therefore, `h` also remains unchanged.

The third line increments `p` by 1. Since `p` is initially 3, it becomes 4 after the increment.

The remaining variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `_`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `f`, and `y`) are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 2, s is k, i is greater than 3, d is 0, h is 0, p is 4, g is n + 1, f is undefined, and y is undefined**
