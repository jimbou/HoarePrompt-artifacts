According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 3 and `i` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least 4.

State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 1, s is greater than or equal to k, i is at least 4, d is 0, h is (n + 1) // 4, p is 3, g is (3n + 3) // 4, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
