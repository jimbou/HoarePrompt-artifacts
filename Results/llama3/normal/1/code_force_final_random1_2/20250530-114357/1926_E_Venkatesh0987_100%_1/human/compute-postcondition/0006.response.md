Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n and greater than (n + 1) // 2, _ is 0, s is less than k and greater than its original value by (d + 1) // 2, i is 2, d is greater than 0 and less than its original value by (d + 1) // 2, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
