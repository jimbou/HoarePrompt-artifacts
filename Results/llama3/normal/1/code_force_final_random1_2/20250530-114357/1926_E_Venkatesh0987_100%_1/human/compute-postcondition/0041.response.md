The code prints the value of `y`, which is calculated as `2^(i - 1) * (2 * (-n + k) - 1)`. 

Here, `i` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`. 

Since the exact values of `i`, `n`, and `k` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `y`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `y` using the given formula.

Output: **2^(i - 1) * (2 * (-n + k) - 1) (where i is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and k is an integer between 1 and n)**
