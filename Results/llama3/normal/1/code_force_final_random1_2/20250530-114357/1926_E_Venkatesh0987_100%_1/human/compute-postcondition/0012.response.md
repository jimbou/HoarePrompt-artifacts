According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 2, `i` is the smallest integer greater than log2(n). `i` being the smallest integer greater than log2(n) does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n and greater than (n + 1) // 2, _ is 0, s is greater than k and greater than its original value by d, i is greater than 2, d is 0, h is (n - 1) // 2, p is 2, g is (n + 1) // 2, stdin contains t - i - 1 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
