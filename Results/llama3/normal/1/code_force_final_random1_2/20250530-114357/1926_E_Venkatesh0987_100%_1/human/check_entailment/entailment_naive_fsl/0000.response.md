Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the process of laying down cards in the specified order, keeping track of the number of cards laid down and the remaining cards. The program correctly handles the case where k is greater than the number of odd-numbered cards and calculates the correct position of the k-th card.

The program uses a while loop to iterate through the process of laying down cards, and it correctly updates the variables s, d, i, g, and p to keep track of the number of cards laid down and the remaining cards. The calculation of the k-th card position is also correct, taking into account the number of cards laid down in each iteration and the remaining cards.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the examples provided, and it produces the correct output in all cases. I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
