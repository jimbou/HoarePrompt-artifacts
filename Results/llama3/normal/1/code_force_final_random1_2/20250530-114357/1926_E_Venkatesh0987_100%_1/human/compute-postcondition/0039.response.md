Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 1, s is greater than or equal to k, i is an integer greater than 0, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables 't', 'n', 'k', '_', 's', 'i', 'd' remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable 'h' is now 0, 'p' is equal to 'i', and 'g' is equal to 'n'. The input in stdin remains the same as the initial state.
