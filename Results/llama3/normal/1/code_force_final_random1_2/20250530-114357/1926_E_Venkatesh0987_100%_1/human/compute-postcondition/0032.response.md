Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n, _ is 1, s is greater than or equal to k, i is the number of iterations, d is 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the sum `s` is greater than or equal to `k`, the number of iterations `i` is the number of times the loop executed, `d` is 0, and the other variables remain unchanged.
