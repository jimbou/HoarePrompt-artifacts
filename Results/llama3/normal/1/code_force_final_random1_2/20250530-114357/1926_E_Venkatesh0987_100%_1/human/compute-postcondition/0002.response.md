Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer between 1 and n and greater than (n + 1) // 2, _ is 0, s is 0, i is 0, the current value of d is n, the current value of h is n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t inputs: two space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
