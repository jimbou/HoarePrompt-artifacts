Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 24 and greater than or equal to `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `1` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `xx` is a list containing an empty string, string `x`, and string `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 3, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is 1, the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F', and the current value of the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S'.**
