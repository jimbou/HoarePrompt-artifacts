Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 24 and greater than or equal to `n-1`, a is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`) plus `n` if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', otherwise it is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), except for indices `i` and `j` which are incremented by `n` if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', b is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `1` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`) plus `n` if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', otherwise it is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), except for index `3` which is incremented by `n` if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', xx is a list containing an empty string, string `x`, and string `x`, x is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', i is 3, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', j is `n`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `j` is equal to `n`, and the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in string `x` and the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' or 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`). The values of `i`, `xx`, `x`, and stdin remain unchanged.
