Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `b` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 1, stdin contains `n-1` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?'**

In this output state, the value of `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', which is obtained from the input. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains `n-1` inputs, as one input has been consumed to assign the value to `x`.
