Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in all strings `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of all strings `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `1` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in all strings `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of all strings `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is `n`, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` remains an integer between 2 and 24. The list `a` contains the total count of 'F' characters in all input strings `x` plus the total count of 'F' characters at each index `j-1` of all input strings `x`. The list `b` contains the total count of 'S' characters in all input strings `x` plus the total count of 'S' characters at each index `j-1` of all input strings `x`. The list `xx` contains all input strings `x` and an empty string. The variable `x` is the last input string of length `n` with characters 'F', 'S', or '?'. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, indicating the loop has executed `n` times. The variable `j` is equal to `n`, and there are no more inputs in stdin.
