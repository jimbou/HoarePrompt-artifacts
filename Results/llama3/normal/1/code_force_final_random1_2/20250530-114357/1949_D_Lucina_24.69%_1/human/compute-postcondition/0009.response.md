Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index 1 is 1, and the value at index `j` is 1 if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', otherwise the value at index `j` is 0, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 1, stdin contains `n-1` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is 1, the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F'.***
