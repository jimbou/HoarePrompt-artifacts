Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is equal to the number of 'F' characters in all strings x plus the number of times the character at index j-1 of all strings x is 'F' for j in range(1, n+1), b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is equal to the number of 'S' characters in all strings x plus the number of times the character at index j-1 of all strings x is 'S' for j in range(1, n+1), xx is a list containing an empty string and all strings x, x is a string of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', i is n+1, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', j is n, sa is a list containing all values of i where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, sb is a list containing all values of i where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0. If the length of sa is greater than or equal to the length of sb, then nx is a string that contains the character at index j - 1 of the string at index i in xx if the character at index j - 1 of the string at index i in xx is not '?'. Otherwise, nx is a string containing either 'F' or 'S', and the character at index j-1 of the string at index i in xx is '?'. If i or j is in the first n // 4 elements of sa, then nx contains 'F'. Otherwise, nx contains 'S'. nx has been appended with the character at index j - 1 of the string at index i in xx if the character at index j - 1 of the string at index i in xx is not '?'. Otherwise, nx has been appended with 'F' if i or j is in the first n // 4 elements of sa, otherwise nx has been appended with 'S'. If i is in sa[:n // 4] or j is in sa[:n // 4], then nx has been appended with 'F'. Otherwise, nx has been appended with 'S'. If xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', then nx has been appended with the character at index j - 1 of the string at index i in xx. Otherwise, nx has been appended with 'F' if i or j is in the first n // 4 elements of sa, otherwise nx has been appended with 'S', and nx is printed. If the length of sa is less than the length of sb, then nx is a string of length n, where each character is either the character at the corresponding position in the string at index i in xx if the character is not '?', or 'S' if i or the position is in the first quarter of the list sb, or 'F' otherwise, and nx is printed for each string x.***
