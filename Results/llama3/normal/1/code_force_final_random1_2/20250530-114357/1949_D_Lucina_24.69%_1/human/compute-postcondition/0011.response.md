The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is 1 and the value at index `j` is 1 if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', otherwise the value at index `j` is 0, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index 1 is 1, and the value at index `j` is 1 if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', otherwise the value at index `j` is 0, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 1, stdin contains `n-1` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1**
