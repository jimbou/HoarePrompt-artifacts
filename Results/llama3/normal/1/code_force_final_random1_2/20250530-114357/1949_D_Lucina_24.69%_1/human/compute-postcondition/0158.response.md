Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in all strings `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of all strings `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index 1 is equal to the number of 'S' characters in all strings `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of all strings `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 3, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is 1, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the current value of `i` has been appended to `sa`, and the length of `sa` is now greater than or equal to the length of `sb` by `n` if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, `nx` is a string that contains the character at index `j - 1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `nx` has been updated to contain the character at index `j - 1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. This character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', but since the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` now contains a character that is either 'F' or 'S'.
