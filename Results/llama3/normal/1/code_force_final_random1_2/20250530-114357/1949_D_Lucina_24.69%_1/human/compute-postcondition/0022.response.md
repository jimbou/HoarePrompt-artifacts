Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x`, the value at index `j` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', otherwise the value at index `j` is 0, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index 1 is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x`, the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` if the character at index `i-1` of string `x` is 'S', otherwise the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x`, the value at index `j` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', otherwise the value at index `j` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x`, and the value at index `k` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` if the character at index `k-1` of string `x` is 'S', otherwise the value at index `k` is 0, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and string `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 1, stdin contains `n-1` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is `n`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `xx` now contains two elements: an empty string and the string `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
