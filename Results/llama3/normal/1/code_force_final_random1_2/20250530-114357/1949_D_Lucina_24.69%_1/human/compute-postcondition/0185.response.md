Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is equal to the number of 'F' characters in all strings x plus the number of times the character at index j-1 of all strings x is 'F' for j in range(1, n+1), `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is equal to the number of 'S' characters in all strings x plus the number of times the character at index j-1 of all strings x is 'S' for j in range(1, n+1), `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings x, `x` is a string of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is n. `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. The current value of `a[i]` is 0 and the current value of `b[i]` is 0. The value of `i` is appended to `sb`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `i` (which is 1) is appended to the list `sb`. The length of `sa` is still less than the length of `sb`, and the current values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` are still 0.
