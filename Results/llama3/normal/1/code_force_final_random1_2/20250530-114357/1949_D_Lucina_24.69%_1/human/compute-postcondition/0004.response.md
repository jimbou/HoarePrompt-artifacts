Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `b` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 1, stdin contains `n-1` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `x` at index `j-1` is 'F'.**
