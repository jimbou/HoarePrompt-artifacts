Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the value of `i` is appended to `sb`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, and `sb` contains all values of `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `nx` is a string 'S', and the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?'. The current value of `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or the current value of `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `nx` has been updated to be a string 'S'. All other variables remain unchanged.
