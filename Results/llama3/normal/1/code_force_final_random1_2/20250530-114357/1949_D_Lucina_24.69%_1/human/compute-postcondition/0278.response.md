Functionality: **This function takes a series of input strings and replaces unknown characters ('?') with either 'F' or 'S' based on the presence of 'F' and 'S' characters in the input strings. It first counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' characters in each string and their corresponding positions. Then, it identifies the positions that have only 'F' or only 'S' characters and creates lists of these positions. If the list of 'F' positions is longer than or equal to the list of 'S' positions, it replaces unknown characters with 'F' if the position is in the first quarter of the 'F' list, and with 'S' otherwise. If the list of 'S' positions is longer, it replaces unknown characters with 'S' if the position is in the first quarter of the 'S' list, and with 'F' otherwise. Finally, it prints the modified strings.**
