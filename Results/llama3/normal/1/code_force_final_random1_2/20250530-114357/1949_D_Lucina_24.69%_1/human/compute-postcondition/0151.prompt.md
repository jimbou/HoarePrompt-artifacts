Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in all strings `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of all strings `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index 1 is equal to the number of 'S' characters in all strings `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of all strings `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 2, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is `n`, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the current value of `i` has been appended to `sa`, and the length of `sa` is now greater than or equal to the length of `sb` by `n` if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]:
        nx += 'F'
    else:
        nx += 'S'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in all strings `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of all strings `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index 1 is equal to the number of 'S' characters in all strings `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of all strings `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 2, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is 1, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the current value of `i` has been appended to `sa`, and the length of `sa` is now greater than or equal to the length of `sb` by `n` if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, `nx` is a string. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'. If `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in all strings `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of all strings `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index 1 is equal to the number of 'S' characters in all strings `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of all strings `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 2, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is 2, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the current value of `i` has been appended to `sa`, and the length of `sa` is now greater than or equal to the length of `sb` by `n` if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, `nx` is a string. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'. If `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. `nx` is now equal to `nx` plus the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` if the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?'. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then `nx` is now equal to `nx` + 'F' if `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`. Otherwise, `nx` has been appended with 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The value of `nx` is updated based on the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character is not '?', `nx` is set to that character. If the character is '?', `nx` is set to 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, otherwise it is set to 'S'. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', `nx` is appended with that character. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', `nx` is appended with 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, otherwise it is appended with 'S'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
