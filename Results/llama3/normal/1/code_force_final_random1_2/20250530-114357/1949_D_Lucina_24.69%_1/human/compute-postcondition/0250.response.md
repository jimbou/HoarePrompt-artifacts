Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n`, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the value of `i` is appended to `sb`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, and `sb` contains all values of `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `nx` is an empty string.**

In this output state, the value of `nx` has been reset to an empty string. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
