Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string x, the value at index j is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string x if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise the value at index j is 0, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x, the value at index i is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x if the character at index i-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index i is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x, the value at index j is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index j is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x, and the value at index k is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x if the character at index k-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index k is 0, xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', i is 1, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', j is n, and n is greater than or equal to n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will iterate `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 24. After each iteration, the values in lists `a` and `b` will be updated based on the characters in string `x`. 

List `a` will keep track of the number of 'F' characters in string `x`. The value at index `i` will be equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x`. The value at index `j` will be equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', otherwise it will be 0.

List `b` will keep track of the number of 'S' characters in string `x`. The value at index 1 will be equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x`. The value at index `i` will be equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` if the character at index `i-1` of string `x` is 'S', otherwise it will be equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x`. The value at index `j` will be equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` if the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', otherwise it will be equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x`. The value at index `k` will be equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` if the character at index `k-1` of string `x` is 'S', otherwise it will be 0.

The other variables, `xx`, `x`, `i`, stdin, and `n`, will remain unchanged.
