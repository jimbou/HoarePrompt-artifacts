The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and n. If j is less than n+1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 24 and greater than 2. For the loop to execute again j must be 3 and n must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24 and greater than 2, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string x plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise the value at index i is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string x plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index i is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string x, the value at index j is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string x plus 2 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise the value at index j is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string x plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index j is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string x, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index 1 is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x, the value at index i is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x if the character at index i-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index i is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x, the value at index j is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index j is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x, the value at index k is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x if the character at index k-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index k is 0, xx is a list containing an empty string and string x, x is a string of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', i is 2, stdin contains n-2 inputs: strings of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', j is 3**
