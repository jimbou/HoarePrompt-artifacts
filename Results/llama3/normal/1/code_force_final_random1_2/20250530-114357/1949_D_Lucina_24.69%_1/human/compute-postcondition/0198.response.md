Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings x, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the value of `i` is appended to `sb`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, and `sb` contains all values of `i` from 1 to n+1 where `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `nx` is an empty string. The current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**
