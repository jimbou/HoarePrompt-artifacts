Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the value of `i` is appended to `sb`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, and `sb` contains all values of `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`. If `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S', otherwise `nx` is 'F'. The character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?'.***
