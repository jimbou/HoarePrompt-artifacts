Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 24 and greater than or equal to `n-1`, a is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), b is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `1` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), and b[i] is incremented by 1, and b[j] is incremented by 1, xx is a list containing an empty string, string `x`, and string `x`, x is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', i is 3, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', j is 1, the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is not 'F', and the current value of the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S'.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `xx`, `x`, `i`, `j`, and stdin remain unchanged. The only modifications are to the list `b`, where the values at indices `i` and `j` are incremented by 1. The rest of the information from the precondition remains valid.
