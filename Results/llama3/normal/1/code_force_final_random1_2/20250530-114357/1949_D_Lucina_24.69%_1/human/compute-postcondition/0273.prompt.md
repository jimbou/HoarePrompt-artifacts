Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n`, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the value of `i` is appended to `sb`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, and `sb` contains all values of `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the value of `i` is appended to `sb`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, and `sb` contains all values of `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`. If `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S', otherwise `nx` is 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the value of `i` is appended to `sb`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, and `sb` contains all values of `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`. If `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S', otherwise `nx` is 'F'. `nx` is either appended with the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` or with either 'S' or 'F', depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and all strings x, x is a string of length n, i is 3, j is 3, sa is a list containing all values of i where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, sb is a list containing all values of i where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, and if a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then the value of i is appended to sb, and the length of sa is less than the length of sb, and sb contains all values of i from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0. nx is a string containing the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx if the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx is not '?'. Otherwise, nx is either 'S' or 'F', depending on whether i or j is in the first n // 4 elements of sb. If i or j is in the first n // 4 elements of sb, then nx is 'S', otherwise nx is 'F'. nx is either appended with the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx or with either 'S' or 'F', depending on whether i or j is in the first n // 4 elements of sb. If i is in sb[:n // 4] or j is in sb[:n // 4], then nx is appended with 'S', otherwise nx is appended with 'F'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
