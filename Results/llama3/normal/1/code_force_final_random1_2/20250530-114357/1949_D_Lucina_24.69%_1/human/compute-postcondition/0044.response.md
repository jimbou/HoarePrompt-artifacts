Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 and greater than or equal to `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `1` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `xx` is a list containing an empty string, string `x`, and string `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 2, stdin contains `n-2` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains between 2 and 24 and is greater than or equal to `n-1`. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged, with their values still dependent on the string `x`. The list `xx` now contains an additional copy of the string `x`, in addition to the empty string and the original string `x`. The string `x` itself remains unchanged, with a length of `n` and characters that are either 'F', 'S', or '?'. The value of `i` is still 2, and the stdin still contains `n-2` inputs, which are strings of length `n` with characters that are either 'F', 'S', or '?'. The value of `j` is still `n`.
