The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is 1 or 2, the value at index j is 1 or 2 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise the value at index j is 0, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is 1, the value at index i is 1 or 2 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index i is 1, the value at index j is 1 or 2 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index j is 1, and the value at index k is 1 if the character at index k-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index k is 0, xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', i is 1, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', j is 3, and n is greater than 2**
