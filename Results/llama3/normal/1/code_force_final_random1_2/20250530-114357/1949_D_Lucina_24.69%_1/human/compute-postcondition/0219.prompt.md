Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings x, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is 1, `j` is n, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the value of `i` is appended to `sb`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, and `sb` contains all values of `i` from 1 to n+1 where `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings x, `x` is a string of length n, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the value of `i` is appended to `sb`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, and `sb` contains all values of `i` from 1 to n+1 where `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing either 'S' or 'F', and the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` of `xx` is '?'. If `i` is in the first quarter of the list `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and all strings x, x is a string of length n, i is 1, j is 2, sa is a list containing all values of i where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, sb is a list containing all values of i where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, and if a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then the value of i is appended to sb, and the length of sa is less than the length of sb, and sb contains all values of i from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0. If the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx is not '?', then nx is a string containing the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx. If the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx is '?', then nx is a string containing either 'S' or 'F'. If i is in the first quarter of the list sb or j is in the first quarter of the list sb, then nx is 'S'. Otherwise, nx is 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and all strings x, x is a string of length n, i is 1, j is 3, sa is a list containing all values of i where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, sb is a list containing all values of i where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, and if a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then the value of i is appended to sb, and the length of sa is less than the length of sb, and sb contains all values of i from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0. If the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx is not '?', then nx is a string containing the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx. If the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx is '?', then nx is a string containing either 'S' or 'F'. If i is in the first quarter of the list sb or j is in the first quarter of the list sb, then nx is 'S'. Otherwise, nx is 'F'. nx is updated to be the concatenation of its previous value and the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx if the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx is not '?'. If the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx is '?', then nx is appended with 'S' if i is in the first quarter of the list sb or j is in the first quarter of the list sb, otherwise nx is appended with 'F'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
