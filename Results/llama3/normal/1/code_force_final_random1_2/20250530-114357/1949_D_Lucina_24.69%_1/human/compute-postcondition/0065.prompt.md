Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 3 and 24 and greater than or equal to `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `1` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `xx` is a list containing an empty string, string `x`, and string `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 3, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 3 and 24 and greater than or equal to `n-1`, a is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), b is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `1` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), xx is a list containing an empty string, string `x`, and string `x`, x is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', i is 3, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', j is 1. If the current value of `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then a[i] and a[j] are each incremented by 1. If the current value of `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then b[i] and b[j] are each incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 3 and 24 and greater than or equal to `n`, a is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`) plus 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', otherwise it is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), b is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `1` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`) plus 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', otherwise it is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), xx is a list containing an empty string, string `x`, and string `x`, x is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', i is 3, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', j is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 3 and 24 and greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`) plus 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', otherwise it is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), except for indices `i` and `j` which are incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', b is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `1` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`) plus 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', otherwise it is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), except for index `3` which is incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', xx is a list containing an empty string, string `x`, and string `x`, x is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', i is 3, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', j is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
