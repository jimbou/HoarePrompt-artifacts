Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24 and greater than 2, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string x plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise the value at index i is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string x plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index i is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string x, the value at index j is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string x plus 2 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise the value at index j is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string x plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index j is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string x, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index 1 is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x, the value at index i is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x if the character at index i-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index i is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x, the value at index j is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x plus 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index j is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x, the value at index k is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string x if the character at index k-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index k is 0, xx is a list containing an empty string and string x, x is a string of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', i is 2, stdin contains n-2 inputs: strings of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', j is 3, b[2] is the number of 'S' characters in string x plus 1, b[3] is the number of 'S' characters in string x plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of n remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 24 and greater than 2. The list a remains unchanged, with its values determined by the number of 'F' characters in string x and the characters at specific indices in string x. The list b has been modified, with the values at indices 2 and 3 incremented by 1. The value at index 2 in list b is now the number of 'S' characters in string x plus 1, and the value at index 3 in list b is also the number of 'S' characters in string x plus 1. The list xx, string x, and variables i and j remain unchanged. The stdin still contains n-2 inputs, which are strings of length n with characters 'F', 'S', or '?'.
