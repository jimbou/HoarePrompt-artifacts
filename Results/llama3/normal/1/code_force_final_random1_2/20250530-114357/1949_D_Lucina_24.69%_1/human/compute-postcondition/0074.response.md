Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is equal to the number of 'F' characters in all strings x plus the number of times the character at index j-1 of all strings x is 'F' for j in range(1, n+1), `b` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is equal to the number of 'S' characters in all strings x plus the number of times the character at index j-1 of all strings x is 'S' for j in range(1, n+1), `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings x, `x` is a string of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is at least 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is n, `sa` is an empty list, and `sb` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been appended to the list `sb`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `sb` now contains the value of `i`, which is at least 1. All other conditions and values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.
