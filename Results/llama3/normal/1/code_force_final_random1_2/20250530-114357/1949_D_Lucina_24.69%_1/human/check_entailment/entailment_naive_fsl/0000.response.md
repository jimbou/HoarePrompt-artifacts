Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It correctly handles the input, identifies the undecided transition videos, and assigns them as funny or scary to satisfy the condition that no more than ⌈3n/4⌉ transition videos of the same type appear consecutively.

The program first counts the number of funny and scary transition videos for each scenario and identifies the scenarios with only funny or scary videos. It then assigns the undecided videos as funny or scary based on the majority type of the scenarios.

The program handles the case where the number of funny scenarios is greater than or equal to the number of scary scenarios, and the case where the number of scary scenarios is greater than the number of funny scenarios. In both cases, it assigns the undecided videos in a way that satisfies the condition.

The program also handles the case where there are no funny or scary scenarios, in which case it assigns all undecided videos as funny or scary.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
