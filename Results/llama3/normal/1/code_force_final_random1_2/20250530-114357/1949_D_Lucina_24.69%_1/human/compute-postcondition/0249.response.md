To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n`, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the value of `i` is appended to `sb`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, and `sb` contains all values of `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `nx` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` if the character is not '?', otherwise `nx` has been appended with either 'S' or 'F' depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, and the string `nx` is being printed.**
