Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and all strings x, x is a string of length n, i is 3, j is 3, sa is a list containing all values of i where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, sb is a list containing all values of i where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, and if a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then the value of i is appended to sb, and the length of sa is less than the length of sb, and sb contains all values of i from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0. nx is a string containing the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx if the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx is not '?'. Otherwise, nx is either 'S' or 'F', depending on whether i or j is in the first n // 4 elements of sb. If i or j is in the first n // 4 elements of sb, then nx is 'S', otherwise nx is 'F'. nx is either appended with the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx or with either 'S' or 'F', depending on whether i or j is in the first n // 4 elements of sb. If i is in sb[:n // 4] or j is in sb[:n // 4], then nx is appended with 'S', otherwise nx is appended with 'F'.***
