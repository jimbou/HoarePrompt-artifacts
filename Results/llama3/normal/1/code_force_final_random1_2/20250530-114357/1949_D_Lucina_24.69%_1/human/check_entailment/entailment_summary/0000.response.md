Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly identifies the positions that have only 'F' or only 'S' characters and replaces unknown characters based on the presence of 'F' and 'S' characters in the input strings. The program also ensures that the modified strings satisfy the condition that no matter in which order the scenarios are played, the player will never see more than \lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.

Correctness: **True**
