Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is 1 or 2, the value at index j is 1 or 2 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise the value at index j is 0, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is 1 or 2, the value at index i is 1 or 2 if the character at index i-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index i is 1, the value at index j is 1 or 2 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index j is 1, and the value at index k is 1 if the character at index k-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index k is 0, xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', i is 1, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', j is 3, and n is greater than 2. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', then the value at index i of a is 2 or 3, the value at index j of a is 2 or 3, and the value at index k of a is 1 or 2 if the character at index k-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise the value at index k of a is 0. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then the value at index 1 of b is 2, the value at index i of b is 2, the value at index j of b is 2, and the value at index k of b is 1 if the character at index k-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index k of b is 1.***
