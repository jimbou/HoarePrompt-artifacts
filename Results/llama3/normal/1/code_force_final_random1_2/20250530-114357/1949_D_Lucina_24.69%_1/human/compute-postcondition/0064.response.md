Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 24 and greater than or equal to 3, a is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`) plus 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', otherwise it is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), except for indices `i` and `j` which are incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', b is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `1` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`) plus 2 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', otherwise it is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), except for index `3` which is incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', xx is a list containing an empty string, string `x`, and string `x`, x is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', i is 3, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', j is 3.***
