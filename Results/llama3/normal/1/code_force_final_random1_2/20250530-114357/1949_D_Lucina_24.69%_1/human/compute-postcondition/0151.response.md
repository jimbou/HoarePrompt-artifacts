Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in all strings `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of all strings `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index 1 is equal to the number of 'S' characters in all strings `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of all strings `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all strings `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 2, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is `n`, `sa` is a list containing all values of `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, and if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then the current value of `i` has been appended to `sa`, and the length of `sa` is now greater than or equal to the length of `sb` by `n` if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `sb` is a list containing all values of `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, `nx` is a string of length `n`. For each index `j` in range(1, `n+1`), if the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then the character at index `j-1` of `nx` is the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then the character at index `j-1` of `nx` is 'F' if `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`. Otherwise, the character at index `j-1` of `nx` is 'S'.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `nx` is a string of length `n`, where each character is determined by the character at the corresponding index in the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character in `xx` is not '?', then the character in `nx` is the same. If the character in `xx` is '?', then the character in `nx` is 'F' if `i` or the index is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, otherwise it is 'S'. The other variables remain unchanged.
