Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is 2, the value at index j is 2, the value at index k is 1 if the character at index k-1 of string x is 'F', otherwise the value at index k is 0, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 1 is 1, and the value at index k is 1 if the character at index k-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise the value at index k is 0, xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', i is 1, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', j is 2, and n is greater than 1**

In this output state, the values of `a[i]` and `a[j]` have been incremented by 1, resulting in 2. The rest of the values in list `a` remain the same, with 1 at index `k` if the character at index `k-1` of string `x` is 'F', and 0 otherwise. List `b` remains unchanged, with 1 at index 1 and 1 at index `k` if the character at index `k-1` of string `x` is 'S', and 0 otherwise. The other variables, including `xx`, `x`, `i`, `j`, `n`, and the contents of stdin, remain unchanged.
