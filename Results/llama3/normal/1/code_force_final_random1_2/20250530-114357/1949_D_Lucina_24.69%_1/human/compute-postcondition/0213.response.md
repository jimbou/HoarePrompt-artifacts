To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 24.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `j` is 2, we can increment it by 1 to make it 3.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and all strings x, x is a string of length n, i is 1, j is 3, sa is a list containing all values of i where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, sb is a list containing all values of i where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0, and if a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then the value of i is appended to sb, and the length of sa is less than the length of sb, and sb contains all values of i from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0. If the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx is not '?', then nx is a string containing the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx. If the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx is '?', then nx is a string containing either 'S' or 'F'. If i is in the first quarter of the list sb or j is in the first quarter of the list sb, then nx is 'S'. Otherwise, nx is 'F'.**
