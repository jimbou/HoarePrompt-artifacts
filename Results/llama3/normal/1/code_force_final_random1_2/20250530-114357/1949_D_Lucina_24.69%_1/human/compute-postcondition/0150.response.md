Postcondition: **The value of `nx` is updated based on the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character is not '?', `nx` is set to that character. If the character is '?', `nx` is set to 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, otherwise it is set to 'S'. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', `nx` is appended with that character. If the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', `nx` is appended with 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, otherwise it is appended with 'S'.**
