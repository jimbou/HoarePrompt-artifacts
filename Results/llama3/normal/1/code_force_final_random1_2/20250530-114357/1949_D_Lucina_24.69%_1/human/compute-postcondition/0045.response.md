The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 and greater than or equal to `n-1`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 24 and greater than or equal to `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is equal to the number of 'F' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `1` is equal to the number of 'S' characters in string `x` plus the number of times the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S' for `j` in range(1, `n+1`), `xx` is a list containing an empty string, string `x`, and string `x`, `x` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `i` is 3, stdin contains `n-2` inputs: strings of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or '?', `j` is `n`.**
