Output State: **a is the sum of the digits of the original value of num, num is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 'a' will hold the sum of all the digits of the original value of 'num', and 'num' will be reduced to 0. This is because the loop continues to remove the last digit of 'num' and add it to 'a' until 'num' becomes 0.
