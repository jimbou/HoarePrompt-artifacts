Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while num != 0:
    a = a + num % 10
    num = int(num / 10)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is the last digit of the original value of num, num is the original value of num with the last digit removed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a is the last digit of the original value of num plus the last digit of the original value of num with the last digit removed, num is the original value of num with the last two digits removed and num currently must not be equal to 0
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is the last digit of the original value of num plus the last digit of the original value of num with the last digit removed plus the last digit of the original value of num with the last digit removed, num is the original value of num with the last three digits removed and num is not equal to 0 and num had at least 2 digits


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
