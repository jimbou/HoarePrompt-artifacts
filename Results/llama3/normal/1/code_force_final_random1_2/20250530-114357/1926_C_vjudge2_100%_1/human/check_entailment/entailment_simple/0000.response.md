Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a precomputation approach to calculate the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in an array A.

The program then reads the number of test cases t and for each test case, it reads an integer n and prints the sum of the digits for the numbers from 1 to n, which is stored in A[n-1].

The function func_1 is used to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number. It works by repeatedly taking the last digit of the number (num % 10), adding it to the sum (a), and removing the last digit from the number (num = int(num / 10)). This process continues until the number becomes 0.

The program's approach is correct because it precomputes the sum of the digits for all possible numbers and stores them in an array, allowing it to quickly retrieve the sum for any given number. The function func_1 correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
