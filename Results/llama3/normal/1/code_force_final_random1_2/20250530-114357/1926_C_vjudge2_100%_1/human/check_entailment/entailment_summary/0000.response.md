Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and storing them in an array A. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the precomputed sum for the given number n.

The function func_1 is used to calculate the sum of the digits of a given integer. It works by repeatedly taking the last digit of the number (num % 10), adding it to the sum (a), and removing the last digit from the number (num = int(num / 10)). This process continues until the number becomes 0.

The main part of the program first precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in the array A. Then, it reads the number of test cases (t) and for each test case, it reads the number n and prints the precomputed sum A[n - 1].

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the function func_1.

Correctness: **True**
