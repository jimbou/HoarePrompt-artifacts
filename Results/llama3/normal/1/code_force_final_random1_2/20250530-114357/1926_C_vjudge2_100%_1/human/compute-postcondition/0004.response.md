Output State: **a is the last digit of the original value of num plus the last digit of the original value of num with the last digit removed, num is the original value of num with the last two digits removed and num currently must not be equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `a` is the sum of the last digit of the original value of `num` and the last digit of the original value of `num` with the last digit removed. The value of `num` is the original value of `num` with the last two digits removed. Note that `num` is still not equal to 0, as it was not equal to 0 in the initial state.
