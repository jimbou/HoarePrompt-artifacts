Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a precomputation approach to store the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 in an array A.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program defines an empty list A to store the cumulative sum of the digits.
2. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the cumulative sum.
3. The program then iterates over the range from 1 to 200,000 (inclusive) using a for loop. For each number `i` in this range:
   a. It calls the function `func_1(i)` to calculate the sum of the digits of `i`.
   b. It adds the result of `func_1(i)` to the `sum` variable.
   c. It appends the updated `sum` value to the list A.
4. After precomputing the cumulative sum for all numbers up to 200,000, the program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
5. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from the input and prints the value of A at index `n-1`. This is because the list A is 0-indexed, but the problem statement uses 1-based indexing.

The function `func_1(num)` calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num` by repeatedly taking the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`), adding it to the sum `a`, and removing the last digit from `num` (using `int(num / 10)`).

Given the problem constraints and the provided example inputs and outputs, the program's logic and implementation appear to be correct. The precomputation approach allows the program to efficiently handle a large number of test cases within the given time limit.

Correctness: **True**
