Output State: **a is the last digit of the original value of num plus the last digit of the original value of num with the last digit removed plus the last digit of the original value of num with the last digit removed, num is the original value of num with the last three digits removed and num is not equal to 0 and num had at least 2 digits**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been incremented by the last digit of the original value of `num` with the last digit removed, which is the same as the last digit of the original value of `num` with the last two digits removed. The value of `num` has been updated to be the original value of `num` with the last three digits removed. The other conditions from the initial state, that `num` is not equal to 0 and had at least 2 digits, remain valid.
