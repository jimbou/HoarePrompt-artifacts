The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line adds the remainder of `num` divided by 10 to `a`. Since `num` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, the remainder of `num` divided by 10 is the last digit of `num`. The second line updates `num` to be the integer division of `num` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `num`.

Output State: **a is the last digit of the original value of num, num is the original value of num with the last digit removed**
