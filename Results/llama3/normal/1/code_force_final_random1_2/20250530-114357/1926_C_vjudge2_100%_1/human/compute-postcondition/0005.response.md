The only variable in the loop head is variable num, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable num.  If num is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, num is the original value of num with the last two digits removed and num currently must not be equal to 0. For the loop to be executed one more time num must not be equal to 0 and num must have had at least 2 digits.
State: **a is the last digit of the original value of num plus the last digit of the original value of num with the last digit removed, num is the original value of num with the last two digits removed and num currently must not be equal to 0 and num must have had at least 2 digits**
