Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `num` remains the same as in the initial state, which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). The code only introduces a new variable `a` and assigns it the value 0. The value of `num` is not affected by the code, so it retains its original range.
