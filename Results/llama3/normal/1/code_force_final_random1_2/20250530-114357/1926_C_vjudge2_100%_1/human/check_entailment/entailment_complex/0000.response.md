Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first calculates the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 200,000 and stores these sums in an array A. This is done using the function func_1, which correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer.

2. Then, for each test case, the program reads an integer n and prints the nth element of the array A (at index n-1, since array indices start at 0). This is correct because the nth element of A is the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to n.

3. The function func_1 correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer. It does this by repeatedly taking the last digit of the number (num % 10), adding it to the sum (a), and removing the last digit from the number (num = int(num / 10)).

4. The time complexity of the program is O(1) for each test case, since it simply looks up the answer in the precomputed array A. This is well within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

5. The space complexity of the program is O(1), since it uses a fixed amount of space to store the array A.

Correctness: **True**
