To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is `num != 0`.

Given that `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, we can see that `num` is already guaranteed to be non-zero. The range of `num` ensures that it is at least 1, which means it cannot be 0.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `num` or `a` to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is 0**
