The variable in the loop head is variable num, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable num.  If num is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, num is the original value of num with the last digit removed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of num needed to have more than one digit and num currently must not be equal to 0.
State: **a is the last digit of the original value of num, num is the original value of num with the last digit removed and num currently must not be equal to 0**
