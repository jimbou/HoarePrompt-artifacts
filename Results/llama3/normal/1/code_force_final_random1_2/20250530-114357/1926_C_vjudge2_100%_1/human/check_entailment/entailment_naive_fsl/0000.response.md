Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a precomputation approach to store the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200000 in an array A. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the corresponding value from the array.

The function func_1 correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number by using a while loop to extract each digit and add it to the sum.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where n is 1 or 200000. The time complexity of the program is O(1) for each test case, which is well within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
