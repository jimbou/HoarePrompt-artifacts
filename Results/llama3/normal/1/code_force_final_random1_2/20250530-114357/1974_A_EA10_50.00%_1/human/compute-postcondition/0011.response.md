Postcondition: ***a is an integer that must be at least 2, i is 1, x is an integer between 0 and 99, y is an integer between 0 and 99, if m is less than a, then z is an integer between 0 and 50 + (x - m + 14) // 15 and stdin contains a-4 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). Otherwise, the values of x, y, z, m and stdin remain unchanged.***
