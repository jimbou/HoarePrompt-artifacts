Output State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `z` is an integer between 0 and 50, `m` is an integer between -395 and 0, `z` is increased by the integer division of `(x - m + 14)` by 15, stdin contains a-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). The current value of m is less than a.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding the result of the integer division of `(x - m + 14)` by 15. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a-1 pairs of integers x and y, and the current value of m is still less than a.
