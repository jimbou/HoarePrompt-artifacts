Output State: **a is an integer that must be at least 2, i is 1, x is an integer between 0 and 99, y is an integer between 0 and 99, z is an integer between 0 and 50, m is an integer between -395 and 0, stdin contains a-3 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

The code block reads a pair of integers x and y from stdin, calculates z as the integer division of y+1 by 2, and then calculates m as 15 times z minus 4 times y. The values of x, y, z, and m are updated accordingly. The value of a remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of i also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. Stdin now contains a-3 pairs of integers x and y, as one pair has been read.
