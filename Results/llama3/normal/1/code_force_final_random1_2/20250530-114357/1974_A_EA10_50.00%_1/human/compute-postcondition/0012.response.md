Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `a` is an integer that must be at least 2.
* `i` is 1.
* `x` is an integer between 0 and 99.
* `y` is an integer between 0 and 99.
* If `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is an integer between 0 and 50 + (x - m + 14) // 15.
* `stdin` contains `a-4` pairs of integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99).

The print statement is `print(z)`. To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the value of `z`.

Since `m` is not defined in the precondition, we cannot determine its value. However, we can consider two cases:

1. If `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is an integer between 0 and 50 + (x - m + 14) // 15. In this case, the value of `z` depends on the values of `x` and `m`.
2. If `m` is not less than `a`, then the value of `z` remains unchanged. However, since `z` is not defined in this case, we cannot determine its value.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be either:

* An integer between 0 and 50 + (x - m + 14) // 15, where x is an integer between 0 and 99, and m is an integer less than a.
* An undefined value (since z is not defined in this case).

Output: **an integer between 0 and 50 + (x - m + 14) // 15 (where x is an integer between 0 and 99, and m is an integer less than a), or an undefined value**
