Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 10^4, i is a-1, x is an integer between 0 and 99, y is an integer between 0 and 99, z is an integer between 0 and 50 + (x - m + 14) // 15 if m is less than a, otherwise z is an integer between 0 and 50, m is an integer between -395 and 0, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `a` remains unchanged, `i` has reached its maximum value of `a-1`, `x` and `y` are still integers between 0 and 99, `z` has been updated according to the loop's logic and can be either between 0 and 50 or between 0 and 50 plus the integer division of `(x - m + 14)` by 15 if `m` is less than `a`, `m` is still an integer between -395 and 0, and there are no more pairs of integers left in the stdin.
