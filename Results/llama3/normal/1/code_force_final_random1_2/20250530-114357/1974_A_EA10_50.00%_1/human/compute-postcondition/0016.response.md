Output State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `z` is an integer between 0 and 50 increased by (x - m + 14) // 15, `m` is an integer, stdin contains a-6 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(x - m + 14) // 15` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `a-5` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, but one pair has been read and used to update `z`.
