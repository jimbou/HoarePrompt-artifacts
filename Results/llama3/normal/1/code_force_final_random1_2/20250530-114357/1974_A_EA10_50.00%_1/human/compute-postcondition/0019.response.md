Output: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `z` is an integer between 0 and 50, `m` is an integer, stdin contains a-5 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If `m` is less than `a`, `z` is increased by (x - m + 14) // 15 and stdin contains a-6 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), and the value of `z` is being printed**
