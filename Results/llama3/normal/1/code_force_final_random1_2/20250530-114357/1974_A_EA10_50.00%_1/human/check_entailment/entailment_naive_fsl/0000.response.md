Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

For example, when the input is (x, y) = (16, 0), the program will output 2, but the correct answer should be 1. This is because 16 1x1 icons can fit in one screen, and there are no 2x2 icons.

The issue with the program is that it calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons first, and then adds the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. However, this approach does not consider the case where the 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space of the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons.

To fix this issue, the program should calculate the total number of cells needed for all icons, and then divide it by the total number of cells in one screen (15) to get the minimum number of screens needed.
