To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(a):`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `a` remains unchanged, but since `i` is now 2, `a` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, if `m` is less than `a`, then `z` is an integer between 0 and 50 + (x - m + 14) // 15 and `stdin` contains `a-4` pairs of integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99). Otherwise, the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, `m` and `stdin` remain unchanged, and the value of `z` is being printed**
