Output State: **a is an integer that must be at least 3, i is 2, x is an integer between 0 and 99, y is an integer between 0 and 99, z is an integer between 0 and 50, m is an integer, stdin contains a-5 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

The code first reads a pair of integers from stdin, assigning them to x and y. This reduces the number of pairs in stdin by 1. Then, it calculates z as the integer division of y+1 by 2, which will be an integer between 0 and 50. Finally, it calculates m as 15 times z minus 4 times y, which will be an integer. The values of a and i remain unchanged.
