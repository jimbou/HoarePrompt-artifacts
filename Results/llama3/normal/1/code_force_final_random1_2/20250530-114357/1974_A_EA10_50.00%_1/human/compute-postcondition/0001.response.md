To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust `a` to be at least 1 and `i` to be 0 (since the loop starts from 0).

State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains `a` pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**
