Output State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, `z` is an integer between 0 and 50 + (x - m + 14) // 15, `m` is an integer between -395 and 0, stdin contains a-4 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99)**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(x - m + 14) // 15` to its previous value. The values of `a`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `m` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `a-4` pairs of integers `x` and `y` instead of `a-3` pairs, as one pair has been read and processed.
