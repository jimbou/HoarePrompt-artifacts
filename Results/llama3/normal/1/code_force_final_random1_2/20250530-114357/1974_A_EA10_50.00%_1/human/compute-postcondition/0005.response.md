Postcondition: ***a is an integer that must be at least 1, i is 0, x is an integer between 0 and 99, y is an integer between 0 and 99, z is an integer between 0 and 50, m is an integer between -395 and 0, stdin contains a-1 pairs of integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If m is less than a, z is increased by the integer division of (x - m + 14) by 15.***
