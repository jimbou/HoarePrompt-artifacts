Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, i is equal to -1, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in s, B is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in s, l is 0, and r is the length of B.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program executes based on the first character of string `s`. If the first character is '>', the value of `l` is incremented by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. If the first character is '<', the program prints a value based on the values of `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the program prints a value calculated using the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' and '<' characters in `s`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the program prints a value calculated using the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' and '<' characters in `s`, and the index of the first '>' character in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program executes based on the first character of string `s`. If the first character is '>', the value of `l` is incremented by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. If the first character is '<', the program prints a value based on the values of `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the program prints a value calculated using the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' and '<' characters in `s`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the program prints a value calculated using the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' and '<' characters in `s`, and the index of the first '>' character in `s`. In both cases, the variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i`. The value of `r` is decremented by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string that starts with '>', `l` is incremented by 1 or 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`, `r` is decremented by 1 or 2. If `s[i]` is '>', then if `l` is less than `r`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `l` is incremented by 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `r` is decremented by 1, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is `b - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `x` is less than 0, then no changes are made to the variables, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` (where `a` is `A[l]`, `b` is `b - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and `i` is incremented by 1). If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the difference between `n` and `i` is printed, which is a value greater than 0. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r <= 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, where `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r <= 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and `n` is greater than `i`. If `s[i]` is not '>', then if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the value of `i` incremented by 1 is printed. Otherwise, `a` is the value of A at index `l` - 1 plus the product of `i` minus `idx_A` at index `l` - 1 and `l`, and `b` is the value of B at index `r` minus `B[r - l]` minus (`idx_B[r - l]` - `i`) * (`r` - `l`) plus (`idx_B[r]` - `i`) * `l` if `r` - `l` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `b` is the value of B at index `r` plus (`idx_B[r]` - `i`) * `l`, and this is printed: `a` * 2 + `b` * 2 + `i` + 1. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` equals 0, then this is printed: `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and this is printed: `2 * a + 2 * b + (n - i)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
