Output: **s is a string that starts with '>', l is incremented by 1, i is incremented by 1, n is greater than i, r is decremented by 2, a is the value of A at index l - 1 plus the product of i minus idx_A at index l - 1 and l, if r - l is greater than or equal to 0, b is the value of B at index r minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) plus (idx_B[r] - i) * l. Otherwise, b is the value of B at index r plus (idx_B[r] - i) * l, and this is printed: a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, where a is the value of A at index l - 1 plus the product of i minus idx_A at index l - 1 and l, and b is the value of B at index r minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) plus (idx_B[r] - i) * l if r - l is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise b is the value of B at index r plus (idx_B[r] - i) * l**
