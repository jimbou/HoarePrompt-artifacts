The code prints the difference between the length of the string `s` and the current index `i`. Since `n` is the length of the string `s` and `i` is equal to 0, the difference will be equal to the length of the string `s`. The `end=' '` argument in the print function means that a space will be printed after the value, rather than a newline.

Output: **n (the length of the string s)**
