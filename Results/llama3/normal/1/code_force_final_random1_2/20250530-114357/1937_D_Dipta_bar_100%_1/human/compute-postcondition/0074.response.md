Output State: **The value of `l` is incremented by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.**

In natural language, this means that the value of `l` has increased by 1, but the values of `r`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `n`, `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between these variables also remain the same as in the initial state.
