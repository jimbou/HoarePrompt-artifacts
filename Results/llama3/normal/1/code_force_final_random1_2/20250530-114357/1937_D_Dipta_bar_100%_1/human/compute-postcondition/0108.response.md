Postcondition: ***The values of `l`, `r`, `i`, `n`, and the string `s` remain unchanged. `a` is set to the element at index `l` in list `A`, `x` is set to the difference between `r` and the sum of `l` and 2, and `b` is set to the element at index `r-1` in list `B`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is further updated by subtracting `B[x]` and `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from it.***
