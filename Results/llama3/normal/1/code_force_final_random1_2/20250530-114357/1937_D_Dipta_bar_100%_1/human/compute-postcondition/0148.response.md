Output State: **`s` is a string that starts with '>', if x is greater than or equal to 0, then l is incremented by 1, i is incremented by 1, n is greater than i, r is decremented by 1, a is A[l], x is r - (l + 2), and b is b - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1). If x is less than 0, then no changes are made to the variables.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by adding the product of `(idx_B[r - 1] - i)` and `(l + 1)` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still dependent on the condition `x >= 0`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, the values of `l`, `i`, `n`, `r`, `a`, and `x` are updated accordingly. If `x` is less than 0, no changes are made to any of the variables.
