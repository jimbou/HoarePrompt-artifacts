Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is a list and is not empty and contains an additional element 1, and `A` is a list with an additional element. If `idx_A` is empty, the additional element in `A` is 0. Otherwise, the additional element in `A` is x + (1 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A), where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (1 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A).**

In this output state, the value of `idx_A` has been updated to include the current index `i`, which is 1. The value of `A` has also been updated to include an additional element, which is calculated based on the previous values of `A` and `idx_A`. The other variables, `s` and `n`, remain unchanged.
