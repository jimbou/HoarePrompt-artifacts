Postcondition: ***`s` is a string that starts with '>', `l` is incremented by 1 or 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`, `r` is decremented by 1 or 2. If `s[i]` is '>', then if `l` is less than `r`, then if `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `l` is incremented by 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `r` is decremented by 1, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is `b - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `x` is less than 0, then no changes are made to the variables, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` (where `a` is `A[l]`, `b` is `b - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, and `i` is incremented by 1). If `l` is not less than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the difference between `n` and `i` is printed, which is a value greater than 0. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r <= 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, where `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r <= 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and `n` is greater than `i`. If `s[i]` is not '>', then if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the value of `i` incremented by 1 is printed. Otherwise, `a` is the value of A at index `l` - 1 plus the product of `i` minus `idx_A` at index `l` - 1 and `l`, and `b` is the value of B at index `r` minus `B[r - l]` minus (`idx_B[r - l]` - `i`) * (`r` - `l`) plus (`idx_B[r]` - `i`) * `l` if `r` - `l` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `b` is the value of B at index `r` plus (`idx_B[r]` - `i`) * `l`, and this is printed: `a` * 2 + `b` * 2 + `i` + 1. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` equals 0, then this is printed: `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and this is printed: `2 * a + 2 * b + (n - i)`.***
