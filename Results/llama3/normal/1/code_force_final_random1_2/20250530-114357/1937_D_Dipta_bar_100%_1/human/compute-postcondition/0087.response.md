Based on the given precondition, let's break down the variables and their values:

* `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', with the first character being '<'.
* `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0.
* `i` is 0.
* `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
* `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`.
* `j` is equal to `n`.
* `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in `s`.
* `B` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in `s`.
* `l` is greater than 0.
* `r` is the second last element of `B`.
* `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
* `b` is equal to either `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, or `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` otherwise.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')`

We can see that the expression inside the print statement involves the variables `a`, `b`, and `i`. Let's substitute the values of these variables based on the precondition:

* `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] * l`.
* `b` is equal to either `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, or `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` otherwise. Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to either `B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + idx_B[r] * l` or `B[r] + idx_B[r] * l`.
* `i` is 0.

Substituting these values into the print statement, we get:

`print((A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] * l) * 2 + (B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + idx_B[r] * l) * 2 + 0 + 1, end=' ')`

Simplifying this expression, we get:

`print(2 * (A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] * l) + 2 * (B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + idx_B[r] * l) + 1, end=' ')`

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a value that is a function of the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' and '<' characters in the string `s`.

Output: **2 * (A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] * l) + 2 * (B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + idx_B[r] * l) + 1 (where A, B, idx_A, idx_B, l, and r are the values defined in the precondition)**
