Postcondition: **The program executes based on the first character of string `s`, with `n` greater than `i`, and `i` incremented by 1. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the program prints `i + 1` if `l` is 0, otherwise it prints `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where `a` and `b` are calculated based on the values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, and `i`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the program prints `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` if `r` is 0, otherwise it prints `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, where `a` is assigned the value of `B[r]`, and `b` is calculated based on the values of `A`, `idx_A`, `l`, `r`, and `i`. In both cases, the value of `r` is decremented by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.**
