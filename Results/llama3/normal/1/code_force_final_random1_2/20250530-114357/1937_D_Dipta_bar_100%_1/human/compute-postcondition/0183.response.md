Output State: **The loop finishes executing when `i` equals `n`. At this point, `l` equals the number of '>' characters in `s`, `r` equals 0, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished processing the entire string `s`. The variable `i` has reached the end of the string, and the variables `l` and `r` have been updated accordingly. The value of `l` now represents the total number of '>' characters in the string, and the value of `r` is 0, indicating that all '<' characters have been processed. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged from their initial values.
