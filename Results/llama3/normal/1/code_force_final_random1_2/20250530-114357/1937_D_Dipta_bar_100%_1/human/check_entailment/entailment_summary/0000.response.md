Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules of the pinball movement and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program uses two arrays, A and B, to store the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' and '<' characters in the string s, respectively. It then uses two pointers, l and r, to iterate through the string from both ends, maintaining the number of '>' and '<' characters encountered.

At each position, the program calculates the cumulative sum based on the current index, the number of previous indices, and the difference between the current index and the previous index. It considers all possible cases, including when l is less than r, l is equal to r, and l is greater than r.

The program correctly handles the boundary cases, such as when the pinball is placed on the first or last cell of the grid, and when the string s consists of only '>' or only '<' characters.

The execution summary provided confirms that the program produces the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
