Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list**

The code assigns the length of string `s` to variable `n`, and initializes two empty lists `A` and `idx_A`. The value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
