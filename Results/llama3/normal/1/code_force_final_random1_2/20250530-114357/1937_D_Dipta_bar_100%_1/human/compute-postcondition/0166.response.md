Output State: **s is a string that starts with '>', l is incremented by 1, i is incremented by 1, n is greater than i, r is decremented by 2, a is the value of A at index l - 1 plus the product of i minus idx_A at index l - 1 and l, b is the value of B at index r minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)**

The code snippet modifies the values of `b` by subtracting `B[r - l]` and `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.
