Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', the first character of s is '<', n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, i is 0, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in s, B is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in s, l is greater than 0, the current value of l is less than or equal to the current value of r, r is the second last element of B, a is equal to A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, and b is equal to B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l).**

In this final state, the value of `b` has been updated by subtracting `B[r - l]` and `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
