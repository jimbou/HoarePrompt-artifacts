Postcondition: ***s is a string that starts with '>'. If x is greater than or equal to 0, then l is incremented by 1, i is incremented by 1, n is greater than i, r is decremented by 1, a is A[l], x is r - (l + 2), and b is b - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1). If x is less than 0, then no changes are made to the variables.***
