Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 1. If `idx_B` is empty, `B` is a list containing at least one element which is 0. Otherwise, `B` is a list with an additional element `x` which is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in `s`.***
