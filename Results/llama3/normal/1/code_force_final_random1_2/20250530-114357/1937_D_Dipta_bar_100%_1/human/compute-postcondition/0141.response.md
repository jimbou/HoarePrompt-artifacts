Postcondition: **The program executes based on the first character of string `s`, with `n` greater than `i`, and `i` incremented by 1. If `r` equals 0, the program prints `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`. Otherwise, `a` is assigned the value of `B[r]`, and if `l - r - 1` is greater than 0, `b` is calculated as `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and the program prints `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`. In both cases, the value of `r` is decremented by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.**
