Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, i is 0, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in s, B is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in s, l is 0, r is the second last element of B, a is the value of B at index r, and b is the value of A at index l-1.**

The code assigns the value of `B[r]` to `a` and the value of `A[l - 1]` to `b`. Since `r` is the second last element of `B` and `l` is 0, `a` becomes the second last element of `B` and `b` becomes the last element of `A`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
