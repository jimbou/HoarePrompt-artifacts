To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 1. To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 1**
