Postcondition: **The program executes based on the first character of string `s` and the value of `r`. If `r` is 0, the program executes based on the first character of string `s`. If the first character is '>', the value of `l` is incremented by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. If the first character is '<', the program prints a value based on the values of `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the program prints a value calculated using the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' and '<' characters in `s`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the program prints a value calculated using the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' and '<' characters in `s`, and the index of the first '>' character in `s`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i`, and the difference between `n` and `i` is printed. If `r` is not 0, `a` is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, `b` is A[l - 1] if l - r <= 0, otherwise `b` is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r, `l` is incremented by 1 if the first character of string s is '>', `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, and this is printed: a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), where a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1] if l - r <= 0, otherwise b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r, and n is greater than i.**
