Output: **The value of `r` is decremented by 1, the program still executes based on the first character of string `s`, `n` is greater than `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is assigned the value of `B[r]`, and if `l - r - 1 > 0`, `b` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1]` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus the product of `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2])` and `(l - r - 1)`, and `b` is incremented by the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `(r + 1)`, and this is printed: `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`**
