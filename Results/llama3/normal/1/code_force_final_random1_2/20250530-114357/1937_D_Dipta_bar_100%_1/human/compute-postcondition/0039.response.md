Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 1, `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in `s` and the value of `i`, and if `idx_B` is not empty, `B` is a list with an additional element `x` which is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, otherwise `B` is a list containing at least one element which is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `idx_B` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is equal to `n - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. If `idx_B` is not empty, the value of `B` has been updated to include an additional element `x`, which is calculated based on the last element of `B`, the last element of `idx_B`, the value of `i`, and the length of `idx_B`. If `idx_B` is empty, the value of `B` remains a list containing at least one element which is 0.
