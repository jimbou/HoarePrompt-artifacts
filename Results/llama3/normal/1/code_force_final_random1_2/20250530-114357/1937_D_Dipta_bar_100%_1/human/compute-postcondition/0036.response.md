Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 1, `B` is a list containing at least one element which is 0**

In this output state, the code has appended a 0 to the list `B`, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still consists of characters '<' and '>', `n` is still at least 1, `i` is still equal to `n - 2`, `idx_A` still contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` still contains the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, and `j` is still 1.
