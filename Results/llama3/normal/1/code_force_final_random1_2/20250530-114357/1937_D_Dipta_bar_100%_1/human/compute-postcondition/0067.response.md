Output State: **a is equal to B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is equal to A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r), s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, i is 0, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in s, B is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in s, l is equal to r, and r is the length of B and is larger than 0. The current value of l is greater than r**

The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 1]` and `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its initial value `A[l - 1]`. No other variables are affected by the code.
