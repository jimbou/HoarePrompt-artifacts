Output State: **s is a string that starts with '>', l is incremented by 1, i is incremented by 1, n is greater than i, r is decremented by 1, a is A[l], x is r - (l + 2), b is b - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)**

In this output state, the values of `s`, `l`, `i`, `n`, `r`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only variable affected by the code is `b`. The first line of the code subtracts the value of `B[x]` from `b`, and the second line further subtracts the product of `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1])` and `(x + 1)` from `b`. The resulting value of `b` is the initial value of `b` minus these two subtractions.
