Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, i is 0, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in s, B is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in s, l is 0, r is the length of B, a is A[0], and b is the last element of B plus (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1). If r - 2 is greater than or equal to 0, then b is updated by subtracting B[x] and (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) from its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of b has been updated by adding (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1) to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.
