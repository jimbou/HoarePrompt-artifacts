Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is equal to `n`, `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in `s`, `B` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in `s`, `l` is 0, and `r` is the second last element of `B`. The first character of `s` is '<'. If `l` is 0, then the value of `i + 1` which is 1 is being printed. If `l` is greater than 0, then a is equal to A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l. If r - l is greater than or equal to 0, then b is equal to B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l. Otherwise, b is equal to B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l. , and this is printed: a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l and b is either B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l or B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l depending on whether r - l is greater than or equal to 0 or not)***
