The code prints the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`. 

Here's a breakdown of the variables involved in the expression:

- `a` is the value of `A` at index `l - 1` plus the product of `i` minus `idx_A` at index `l - 1` and `l`. 
- `b` is the value of `B` at index `r` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `b` is the value of `B` at index `r` plus `(idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, and `i` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated result.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is the value of A at index l - 1 plus the product of i minus idx_A at index l - 1 and l, b is the value of B at index r minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) plus (idx_B[r] - i) * l if r - l is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise b is the value of B at index r plus (idx_B[r] - i) * l, and i is incremented by 1)**
