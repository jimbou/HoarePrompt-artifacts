Output State: **`s` is a string that starts with '>', `l` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `r` is decremented by 2, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` still starts with '>', `l` and `i` have been incremented by 1, `n` is still greater than `i`, `r` has been decremented by 2, `a` is still equal to `B[r]`, and `b` has been updated to include the additional term `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. The value of `b` depends on whether `l - r - 1` is greater than 0 or not.
