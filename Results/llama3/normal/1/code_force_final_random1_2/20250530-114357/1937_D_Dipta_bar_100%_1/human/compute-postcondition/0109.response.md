Output State: **`l`, `r`, `i`, `n`, and the string `s` remain unchanged. `a` is set to the element at index `l` in list `A`, `x` is set to the difference between `r` and the sum of `l` and 2, and `b` is set to the element at index `r-1` in list `B` plus `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is further updated by subtracting `B[x]` and `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from it.**

In this output state, the values of `l`, `r`, `i`, `n`, and the string `s` are unchanged from their initial state. The value of `a` is still the element at index `l` in list `A`. The value of `x` is still the difference between `r` and the sum of `l` and 2. The value of `b` has been updated to be the element at index `r-1` in list `B` plus `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is further updated by subtracting `B[x]` and `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from it.
