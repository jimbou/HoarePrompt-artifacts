Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules of the pinball movement and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program first calculates the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in the string `s` from left to right, and the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in `s` from right to left. It then iterates through the string from both ends, maintaining two pointers `l` and `r` to track the number of '>' and '<' characters encountered, respectively.

At each position, the program calculates the cumulative sum based on the current index, the number of previous indices, and the difference between the current index and the previous index. It considers all possible cases, including when `l` is less than `r`, `l` is equal to `r`, and `l` is greater than `r`.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the pinball is placed on the first or last cell of the grid, and when the grid contains only '>' or '<' characters.

Overall, the program correctly implements the rules of the pinball movement and calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

Correctness: **True**
