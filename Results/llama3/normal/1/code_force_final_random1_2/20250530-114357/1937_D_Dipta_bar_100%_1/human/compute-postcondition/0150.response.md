Output: **`s` is a string that starts with '>', if x is greater than or equal to 0, then l is incremented by 1, i is incremented by 1, n is greater than i, r is decremented by 1, a is A[l], x is r - (l + 2), and b is b - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1). If x is less than 0, then no changes are made to the variables, and this is printed: a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is A[l], b is b - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1), and i is incremented by 1)**
