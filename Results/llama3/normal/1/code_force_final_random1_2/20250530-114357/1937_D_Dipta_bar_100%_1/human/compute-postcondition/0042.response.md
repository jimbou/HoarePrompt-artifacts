Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 2. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in `s` and the value of `i`, and if `idx_B` is not empty, `B` is a list with an additional element `x` which is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, otherwise `B` is a list containing at least one element which is 0. If `s[i]` is not '<', then no changes are made to `idx_B` and `B`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `i` has been updated to `n - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `idx_B` and `B` are still dependent on the value of `s[i]`, which is now `s[n - 3]`.
