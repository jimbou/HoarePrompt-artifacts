Output State: **`s` is a string that starts with '>', `l` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`, `r` is decremented by 2**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1 from its initial state, where it was already decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `s` still being a string that starts with '>', `l` and `i` still being incremented by 1, and `n` still being greater than `i`.
