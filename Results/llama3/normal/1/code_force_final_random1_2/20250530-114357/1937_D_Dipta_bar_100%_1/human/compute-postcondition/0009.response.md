Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', `idx_A` is a list and is not empty and contains an additional element 0, and `A` is a list with an additional element x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A).***
