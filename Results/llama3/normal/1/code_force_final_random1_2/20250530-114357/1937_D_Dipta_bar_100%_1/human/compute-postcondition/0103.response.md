Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is equal to `n`, `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in `s`, `B` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in `s`, `l` is 0, and `r` is the second last element of `B`. The first character of `s` is '<'. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then if `l` is 0, the value of `i + 1` which is 1 is printed. If `l` is greater than 0, then `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. If `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is equal to `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Then, `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed. If `l` is greater than `r`, then if `r` is 0, the value of `n - 2x` is printed, where `x` is the index of the first '>' character in `s`. Otherwise, `a` is the value of `B` at index `r`, and `b` is the value of `A` at index `l-1` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is updated to be the value of `A` at index `l-1` minus `A[l - r - 2]` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`. Then, `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is printed.***
