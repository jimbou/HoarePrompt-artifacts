Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 1, i is equal to n - 1 - j, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, B is a list where the last element is B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B), idx_B is a list, j is 0. The current value of s[i] is '<'. The length of idx_B is not equal to 0**

The code calculates the value of `x` by adding the last element of `B` to the product of the difference between the last element of `idx_B` and `i`, and the length of `idx_B`. This value is then appended to `B`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
