Postcondition: **The program prints a value based on the string s and its indices. If l is less than r, the program prints the value of a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, where a is the first element of A, b is the last element of B plus (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1), and i is the current index. If r - 2 is greater than or equal to 0, b is updated by subtracting B[x] and (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) from its original value. If l is not less than r, the program prints the value of a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), where a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r, and if l - r > 0, b is updated to A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r). If r is 0, the program prints the value of n - i.**
