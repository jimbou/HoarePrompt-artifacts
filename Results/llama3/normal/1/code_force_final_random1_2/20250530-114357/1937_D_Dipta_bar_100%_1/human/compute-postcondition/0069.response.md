Output State: **`a` is equal to B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, `b` is equal to A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r, `s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is equal to `n`, `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in `s`, `B` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in `s`, `l` is equal to `r`, and `r` is the length of `B` and is larger than 0. If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is updated to A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r), otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` is updated by adding the product of `i - idx_A[l - 1]` and `r` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between variables are still valid, including the relationship between `l` and `r`, and the conditional update of `b` based on `l - r > 0`.
