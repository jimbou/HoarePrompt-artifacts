Output State: **A has one more element than before, s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and is greater than 1, i is 2, x is the last element of A plus (i - the last element of idx_A) times the length of idx_A, idx_A has one more element than before which is the index of the newly added element in A.**

Explanation: The first line calculates the value of `x` by adding the last element of `A` to the product of `(i - the last element of idx_A)` and the length of `idx_A`. The second line appends this calculated value `x` to the end of list `A`. As a result, `A` has one more element than before. The value of `x` is the last element of `A` plus `(i - the last element of idx_A)` times the length of `idx_A`. The length of `idx_A` also increases by 1, as it now includes the index of the newly added element in `A`. The values of `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
