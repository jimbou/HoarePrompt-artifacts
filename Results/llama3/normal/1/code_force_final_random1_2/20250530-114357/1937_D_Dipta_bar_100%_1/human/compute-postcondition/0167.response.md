Postcondition: ***s is a string that starts with '>', l is incremented by 1, i is incremented by 1, n is greater than i, r is decremented by 2, a is the value of A at index l - 1 plus the product of i minus idx_A at index l - 1 and l, if r - l is greater than or equal to 0, b is the value of B at index r minus B[r - l] minus (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l). Otherwise, b is the value of B at index r***
