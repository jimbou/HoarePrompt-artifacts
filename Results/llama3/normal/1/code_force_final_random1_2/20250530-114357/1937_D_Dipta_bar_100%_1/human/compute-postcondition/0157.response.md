The code prints the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`. Let's break down the values of the variables involved:

*   `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. This means `a` is the value at index `r - 1` in list `B`, plus the product of the difference between the index `idx_B[r - 1]` and the current index `i`, and the value of `r`.
*   `b` has two possible values depending on the condition `l - r <= 0`:
    *   If `l - r <= 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. This means `b` is the value at index `l - 1` in list `A`, plus the product of the difference between the current index `i` and the index `idx_A[l - 1]`, and the value of `r`.
    *   If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. This means `b` is the difference between the values at indices `l - 1` and `l - r - 1` in list `A`, minus the product of the difference between the indices `idx_A[l - 1]` and `idx_A[l - r - 1]`, and the difference `l - r`, plus the product of the difference between the current index `i` and the index `idx_A[l - 1]`, and the value of `r`.
*   `n - i` is the difference between the value of `n` and the current index `i`.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `l`, `r`, `i`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.

Output: **a \* 2 + b \* 2 + (n - i) (where a is B\[r - 1\] + (idx\_B\[r - 1\] - i) \* r, b is A\[l - 1\] + (i - idx\_A\[l - 1\]) \* r if l - r <= 0, otherwise b is A\[l - 1\] - A\[l - r - 1\] - (idx\_A\[l - 1\] - idx\_A\[l - r - 1\]) \* (l - r) + (i - idx\_A\[l - 1\]) \* r, and n - i is the difference between the value of n and the current index i)**
