Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `A` is a list containing a single element 0, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0, the current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', and the current length of `idx_A` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` remains the same, consisting of '<' and '>' characters, and its length `n` is still greater than 0. The list `A` now contains a single element, which is 0. The list `idx_A` is still empty. The index `i` is still 0, and the character at this index in string `s` is still '>'. The length of `idx_A` is still 0.
