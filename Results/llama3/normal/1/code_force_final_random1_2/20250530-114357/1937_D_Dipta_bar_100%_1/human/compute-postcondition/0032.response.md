Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 0, `idx_B` is a list containing the index `i` where `s[i]` is '<', and `B` is a list where the last element is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` if `idx_B` is not empty, otherwise `B` is a list containing 0.**

In this output state, the value of `idx_B` has been updated to include the index `i` where `s[i]` is '<'. The value of `B` has also been updated accordingly, taking into account the new index `i` in `idx_B`. The other variables remain unchanged.
