Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is at least 2, i is equal to n - 3, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, j is 2, idx_B is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in s and the value of i, B is a list with an additional element x which is equal to B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)**

In this output state, the value of `s`, `n`, `i`, `idx_A`, `A`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `idx_B` is updated to include the index `i` because `s[i]` is '<'. The value of `B` is updated by appending a new element `x`, which is calculated based on the last element of `B`, the last index in `idx_B`, the value of `i`, and the length of `idx_B`.
