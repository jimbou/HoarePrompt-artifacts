Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, i is n, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, where each element is calculated as the previous element plus the difference between the current index and the previous index times the number of previous indices, B is an empty list, idx_B is an empty list.**

The code initializes two new lists, B and idx_B, and assigns them empty values. This does not affect the values of the existing variables s, n, i, idx_A, and A.
