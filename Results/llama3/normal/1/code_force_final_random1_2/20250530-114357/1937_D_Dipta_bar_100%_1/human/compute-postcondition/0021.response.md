Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '>', then `idx_A` has one more element than before which is the index of the newly added element in `A`, `A` has one more element than before, and `x` is the last element of `A` plus `(i - the last element of `idx_A`) times the length of `idx_A`. If `s[i]` is not '>', then no changes are made to `idx_A`, `A`, or `x`.***
