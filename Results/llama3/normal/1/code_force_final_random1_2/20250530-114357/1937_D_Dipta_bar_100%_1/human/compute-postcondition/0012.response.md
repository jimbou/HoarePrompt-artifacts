Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and is greater than 0, i is 1, idx_A is a list and is not empty and contains an additional element 0, A is a list with two additional elements x and x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A), where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A).**

In this final state, the string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged. The index `i` is still 1. The list `idx_A` still contains an additional element 0 and is not empty. The list `A` has been modified to include two new elements: `x` and `x + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. The value of `x` is calculated based on the previous value of `A` and the difference between the current index `i` and the last element of `idx_A`, multiplied by the length of `idx_A`.
