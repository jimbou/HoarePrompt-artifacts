Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, i is n, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, where each element is calculated as the previous element plus the difference between the current index and the previous index times the number of previous indices.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the output state will have the following properties:

* The string `s` remains unchanged, consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
* The variable `n` remains unchanged, representing the length of the string `s`.
* The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over the entire string.
* The list `idx_A` will contain the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`.
* The list `A` will contain the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`. Each element in `A` is calculated by adding the difference between the current index and the previous index times the number of previous indices to the previous element in `A`. This represents the total "distance" between the '>' characters in the string.
