Output State: **a is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r), l is incremented by 1 if the first character of string s is '>', i is incremented by 1, n is greater than i**

In this final state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code snippet. The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `A[l - r - 1]` and `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its initial value `A[l - 1]`. The value of `l` is incremented by 1 if the first character of string `s` is '>', and the value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains greater than `i`.
