Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 2. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in `s` and the value of `i`, and `B` is a list with an additional element 0. If `s[i]` is not '<', then no changes are made to `idx_B` and `B` is a list with an additional element 0.**

In this output state, the code has appended a new element 0 to the list `B`, regardless of the value of `s[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` still contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` and the value of `i`. If `s[i]` is not '<', then `idx_B` is not affected. The list `B` now has an additional element 0, which is appended to the end of the list.
