Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list containing 0, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0. The current value of `s[i]` is '<'.**

The code appends 0 to the list `B`, which was initially empty. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `B` now contains a single element, 0. The other variables retain their initial values and properties.
