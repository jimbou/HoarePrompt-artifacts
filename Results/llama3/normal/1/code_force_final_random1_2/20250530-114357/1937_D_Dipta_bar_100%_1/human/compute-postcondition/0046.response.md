Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 2, `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in `s` and the value of `i`, and `B` is a list with an additional element `x` which is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` if `idx_B` is not empty, otherwise `B` is a list with an additional element 0.**

In this output state, the value of `idx_B` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, and the value of `B` has been updated accordingly based on the value of `idx_B`. The other variables remain unchanged.
