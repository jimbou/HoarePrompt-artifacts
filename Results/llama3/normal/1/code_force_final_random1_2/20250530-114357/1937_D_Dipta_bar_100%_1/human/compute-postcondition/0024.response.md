To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is equal to `n` before the loop starts, we can adjust `i` to be equal to `n`, which is at least 1. We also need to adjust `j` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0**
