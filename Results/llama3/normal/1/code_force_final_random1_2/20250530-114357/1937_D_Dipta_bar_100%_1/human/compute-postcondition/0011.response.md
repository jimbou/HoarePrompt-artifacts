Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 1, if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', `idx_A` is a list and is not empty and contains an additional element 0, and `A` is a list with an additional element 0.**

In this output state, the code has appended a new element 0 to the end of list `A`. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still consists of characters '<' and '>', and its length `n` is still greater than 0. The value of `i` is still 1. The list `idx_A` is still not empty and contains an additional element 0. The list `A` now has an additional element 0 at the end.
