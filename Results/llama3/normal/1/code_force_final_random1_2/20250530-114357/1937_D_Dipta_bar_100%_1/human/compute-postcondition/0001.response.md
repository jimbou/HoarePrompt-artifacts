According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of s and must be greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
