Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 1**

The code updates the value of `i` to `n - 1 - j`, where `j` is 1. Since `j` is 1, the value of `i` becomes `n - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
