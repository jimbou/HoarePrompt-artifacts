Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If the current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', `idx_A` is a list and is not empty and contains an additional element 1, and `A` is a list with an additional element. If `idx_A` is empty, the additional element in `A` is 0. Otherwise, the additional element in `A` is x + (1 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A), where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (1 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A). If the current character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', no changes are made.***
