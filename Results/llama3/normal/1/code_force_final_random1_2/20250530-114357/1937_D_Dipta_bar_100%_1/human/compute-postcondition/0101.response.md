Output: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, i is 0, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in s, B is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in s, l is 0, r is the second last element of B, a is the value of B at index r, and b is the value of A at index l-1 plus (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1). If l - r - 1 > 0, then b is updated to be the value of A at index l-1 minus A[l - r - 2] minus (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)., and this is printed: a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)**
