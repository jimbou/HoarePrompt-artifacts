Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, i is 0, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in s, B is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in s, l is 0, r is the length of B, a is A[0], x is r - 2, and b is the last element of B.**

The code snippet assigns values to the variables `a`, `x`, and `b` based on the existing variables `A`, `l`, `r`, and `B`. The variable `a` is assigned the value of `A[l]`, which is the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s` at index `l`. The variable `x` is assigned the value of `r - (l + 2)`, which is the difference between the length of `B` and the current index `l` plus 2. The variable `b` is assigned the value of the last element of `B`, which is the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in `s`. The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `idx_A`, `j`, `idx_B`, and `r` remain unchanged.
