Output: **2 times the value of a (where a is B[r] and r is decremented by 2), plus 2 times the value of b (where b is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1) if l - r - 1 > 0, otherwise b is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)), plus the difference between n and i (where n is greater than i)**
