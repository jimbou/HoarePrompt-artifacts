Postcondition: **The value of `r` is decremented by 1, the program still executes based on the first character of string `s`, `n` is greater than `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. If `l` is 0, then `i + 1` is printed. Otherwise, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1]` plus the product of `i - idx_A[l - 1]` and `l`. If `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is equal to `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus the product of `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` and `(r - l)` plus the product of `(idx_B[r] - i)` and `l`. The value of `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` is printed, where `a` is `A[l - 1]` plus the product of `i - idx_A[l - 1]` and `l`, and `b` is `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus the product of `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` and `(r - l)` plus the product of `(idx_B[r] - i)` and `l`, and `i` is the incremented value of `i`.**
