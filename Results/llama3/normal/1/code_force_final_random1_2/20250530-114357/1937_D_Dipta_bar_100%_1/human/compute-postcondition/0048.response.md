Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is equal to -1, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is equal to `n`. `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in `s`, and `B` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in `s`, where each element is calculated as the previous element plus the difference between the current index and the previous index times the number of previous indices.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length `n` of the string remains the same, and the index `i` becomes -1. The list `idx_A` still contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, and the list `A` still contains the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`. The loop counter `j` becomes equal to the length `n` of the string. The list `idx_B` now contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s`, and the list `B` contains the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in `s`, where each element is calculated as the previous element plus the difference between the current index and the previous index times the number of previous indices.
