Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, i is 0, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in s, B is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in s, l is 0, r is the length of B, a is A[0], x is greater than or equal to 0, and b is the value of b after subtracting B[x] and (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) from its original value.**

The code modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `B[x]` and `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from its original value. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and all other variables retain their original values.
