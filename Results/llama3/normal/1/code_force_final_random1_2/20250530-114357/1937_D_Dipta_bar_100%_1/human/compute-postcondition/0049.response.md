Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, i is equal to -1, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in s, B is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in s, l is 0, and r is the length of B.**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `s`, `n`, `i`, `idx_A`, `A`, `j`, `idx_B`, or `B`. It only introduces two new variables, `l` and `r`, and assigns them the values 0 and the length of `B`, respectively. The values of `l` and `r` are calculated based on the existing variables, but they do not affect the values of any other variables.
