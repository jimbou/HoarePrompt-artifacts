Output State: **`s` is a string that starts with '>', `l` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `r` is decremented by 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r <= 0`, otherwise `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r**.

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the additional term `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the condition `l - r > 0` is still relevant, and the value of `b` depends on this condition.
