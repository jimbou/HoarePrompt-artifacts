Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is equal to `n`, `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in `s`, `B` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in `s`, `l` is 0, and `r` is the second last element of `B`. The first character of `s` is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be the second last element of `B`, which is one less than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
