Output State: **`a` is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, `b` is A[l - 1] if l - r <= 0, otherwise `b` is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r, `l` is incremented by 1 if the first character of string s is '>', `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i`**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by adding the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `r` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `l` and `i` are still dependent on the first character of string `s` and the initial values of `l` and `i`, respectively.
