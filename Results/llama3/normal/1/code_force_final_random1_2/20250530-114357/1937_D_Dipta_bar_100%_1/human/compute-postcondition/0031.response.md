Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 0. The current value of `s[i]` is '<'. If `idx_B` is empty, `B` is a list containing 0 and `idx_B` is an empty list. Otherwise, `B` is a list where the last element is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` and `idx_B` is a list.***
