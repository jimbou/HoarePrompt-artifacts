The code prints the result of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`, where `a` is the value of `A[l - 1]` plus the product of `i - idx_A[l - 1]` and `l`, `b` is the value of `B[r]` minus `B[r - l]` minus the product of `(idx_B[r - l] - i)` and `(r - l)` plus the product of `(idx_B[r] - i)` and `l`, and `i` is the incremented value of `i`.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l, b is B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l, and i is the incremented value of i)**
