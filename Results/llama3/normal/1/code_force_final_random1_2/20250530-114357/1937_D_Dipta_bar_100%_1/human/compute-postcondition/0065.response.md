Output State: **a is equal to B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, b is equal to A[l - 1], s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, i is 0, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in s, B is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in s, l is equal to r, and r is the length of B and is larger than 0.**

In this output state, the variables a and b have been assigned new values based on the given expressions. The value of a is calculated by adding the last element of list B (B[r - 1]) to the product of the difference between the last index of '<' characters (idx_B[r - 1]) and the current index i, multiplied by the length of list B (r). The value of b is simply the last element of list A (A[l - 1]). All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
