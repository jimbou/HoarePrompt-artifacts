Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `idx_A` has one more element than before which is the index of the newly added element in `A`, `A` has one more element than before, `x` is the last element of `A` plus `(i - the last element of `idx_A`) times the length of `idx_A`**

In this output state, the value of `idx_A` has been updated by appending the value of `i` which is 2. The length of `idx_A` and `A` has increased by 1. The value of `x` has also been updated based on the new values of `A` and `idx_A`. The values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged.
