Postcondition: **The program executes based on the first character of string `s`. If the first character is '>', the value of `l` is incremented by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. If the first character is '<', the program prints a value based on the values of `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the program prints a value calculated using the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' and '<' characters in `s`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the program prints a value calculated using the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' and '<' characters in `s`, and the index of the first '>' character in `s`.**
