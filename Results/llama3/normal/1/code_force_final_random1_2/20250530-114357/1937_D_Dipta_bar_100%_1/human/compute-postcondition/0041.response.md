The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 2, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 2. If `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in `s` and the value of `i`, and if `idx_B` is not empty, `B` is a list with an additional element `x` which is equal to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, otherwise `B` is a list containing at least one element which is 0. If `s[i]` is not '<', then no changes are made to `idx_B` and `B`.**
