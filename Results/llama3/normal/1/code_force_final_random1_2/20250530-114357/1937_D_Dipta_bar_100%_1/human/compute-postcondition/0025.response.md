Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is at least 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - j`, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been updated to `n - 1 - j`, which is a new expression based on the initial values of `n` and `j`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their initial values are still valid.
