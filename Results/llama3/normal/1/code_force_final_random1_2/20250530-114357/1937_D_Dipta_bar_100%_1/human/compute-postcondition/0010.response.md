To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head variables, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `s`, `idx_A`, and `A`, are not part of the loop head and are not affected by the loop iteration.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 1, if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', `idx_A` is a list and is not empty and contains an additional element 0, and `A` is a list with an additional element x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A).**
