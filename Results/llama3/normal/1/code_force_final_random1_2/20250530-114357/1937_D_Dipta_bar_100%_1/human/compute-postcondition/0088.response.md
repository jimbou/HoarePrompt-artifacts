Output: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', the first character of s is '<', n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, i is 0, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in s, B is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in s, l is greater than 0, r is the second last element of B, a is equal to A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l. If r - l is greater than or equal to 0, then b is equal to B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l. Otherwise, b is equal to B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l. , and this is printed: a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 (where a is A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l and b is either B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l or B[r] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l depending on whether r - l is greater than or equal to 0 or not)**
