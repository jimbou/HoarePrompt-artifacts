Output State: **s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and is greater than 0, A is a list with an additional element x, idx_A is a list and is not empty, i is 0, and the current character at index i in string s is '>', x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)**

The code calculates the value of x by adding the last element of list A to the product of the difference between the current index i and the last element of list idx_A, and the length of list idx_A. This value is then appended to list A. The value of x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A). The length of list A increases by 1. The value of i remains unchanged as 0, and the current character at index i in string s remains '>'. The length of string s, n, remains unchanged.
