Postcondition: ***s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, i is 0, idx_A is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in s, A is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters in s, j is equal to n, idx_B is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in s, B is a list containing the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters in s, l is equal to r, and r is the length of B. If r is 0, then the value of n - i which is the length of s minus the current index i which is equal to n is being printed. If r is larger than 0, then `a` is equal to B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, `b` is equal to A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r, and if `l - r > 0`, then `b` is updated to A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r). The value of the expression a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i) is printed.***
