Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if len(idx_A) == 0:
            A.append(0)
        else:
            x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
            A.append(x)
        idx_A.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', `idx_A` is a list and is not empty and contains an additional element 0, and `A` is a list with an additional element x, where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If the current character at index `i` in string `s` is '>', `idx_A` is a list and is not empty and contains an additional element 1, and `A` is a list with an additional element. If `idx_A` is empty, the additional element in `A` is 0. Otherwise, the additional element in `A` is x + (1 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A), where x is equal to A[len(A) - 2] + (1 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A). If the current character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '>', then `idx_A` has one more element than before which is the index of the newly added element in `A`, `A` has one more element than before, and `x` is the last element of `A` plus `(i - the last element of `idx_A`) times the length of `idx_A`. If `s[i]` is not '>', then no changes are made to `idx_A`, `A`, or `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
