    #State: The loop finishes executing when `i` equals `n`. At this point, `l` equals the number of '>' characters in `s`, `r` equals 0, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' as input and prints the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' and '>' characters in `s` at each position, considering the number of previous indices and the difference between the current index and the previous index. The function iterates through the string from both ends, maintaining two pointers `l` and `r` to track the number of '>' and '<' characters encountered, respectively. At each position, it calculates the cumulative sum based on the current index, the number of previous indices, and the difference between the current index and the previous index. The function prints the calculated cumulative sum at each position, considering all possible cases, including when `l` is less than `r`, `l` is equal to `r`, and `l` is greater than `r`.
