Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, tem is the product of the last element of arr and 1, i is the last index of arr**

The code multiplies the value of `tem` by the last element of `arr` and appends the result to `ans`. The value of `tem` is updated to be the product of the last element of `arr` and 1. The value of `i` remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The list `arr` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
