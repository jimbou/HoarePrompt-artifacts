Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding some permutation to the array. However, the provided program does not implement any logic to solve this problem. It only contains some general-purpose functions for reading input and sorting arrays, but it does not use these functions to solve the problem.

A correct solution would involve sorting the array, then iterating over the sorted array to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation. The provided program does not implement this logic, so it is incorrect.
