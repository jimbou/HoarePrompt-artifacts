To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from the second last index of `arr` down to the first index (0).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second last index of `arr`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

The state of `arr` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `ans` and `tem` is not directly related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, and the product of the last element of arr, the second last element of arr and 1, tem is the product of the last element of arr, the second last element of arr and 1, i is the third last index of arr**

Note that we cannot determine the exact values of `ans` and `tem` without knowing the contents of `arr`, but we can infer that `i` needs to be decremented by 1 for the loop to execute again.
