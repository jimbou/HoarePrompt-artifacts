Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, and the product of the last element of arr, the second last element of arr and 1, tem is the product of the last element of arr, the second last element of arr and 1, i is the second last index of arr**

The code multiplies the current value of `tem` by the element at index `i` in `arr` and assigns the result back to `tem`. Since `tem` was initially the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, and `i` is the second last index of `arr`, `tem` becomes the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr`, and 1. The code then appends this new value of `tem` to the list `ans`. As a result, `ans` now contains the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, and the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr`, and 1. The value of `arr` and `i` remains unchanged.
