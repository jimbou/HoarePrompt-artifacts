To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `arr` has at least 1 element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `arr` to have at least 1 element, and `i` should be the last index of `arr` (since the loop iterates in reverse order). The states of `ans` and `tem` are not relevant to the loop execution, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is the last index of `arr`**
