This function calculates the cumulative product of a list of non-negative integers and returns the result as a new list. The function takes a list of non-negative integers as input, multiplies each element by the cumulative product of all previous elements, and returns a new list containing these cumulative products. The input list remains unchanged. The function returns a list of the same length as the input list, where each element is the product of all elements up to that point in the input list.
