Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a list containing the product of the last element of arr and 1, the product of the last element of arr, the second last element of arr and 1, the product of the last element of arr, the second last element of arr, the third last element of arr and 1, tem is the product of the last element of arr, the second last element of arr, the third last element of arr and 1, i is the third last index of arr**

The code multiplies the current value of `tem` by the element at index `i` in `arr` and appends the result to `ans`. Since `tem` is initially the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr`, and 1, and `i` is the third last index of `arr`, the new value of `tem` becomes the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr`, the third last element of `arr`, and 1. This new value is then appended to `ans`, which now contains three products: the product of the last element of `arr` and 1, the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr`, and 1, and the product of the last element of `arr`, the second last element of `arr`, the third last element of `arr`, and 1.
