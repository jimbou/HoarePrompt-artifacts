Postcondition: ***The command is a list of strings split by space from the input, object is '.B', '.Q', or '.S', elements dictionary, points, and allPlayers dictionary are modified as necessary, time is increased by 1, t is greater than time, stdin is empty. If the length of the command is 3, then obj is '.B', '.Q', or '.S', com is a string, el is a string, command is a list of strings split by space from the input, object is '.B', '.Q', or '.S', elements dictionary, points, and allPlayers dictionary are modified as necessary, time is increased by 1, t is greater than time, stdin is empty. If el is '.Q', then allPlayers[obj] is True. If el is '.S', then points[0] is increased by 10 if obj is '.B', points[1] is increased by 10 if obj is '.Q' or '.S', and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is the current time and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal for the current team, and team is 1 if obj is '.B', team is 0 if obj is '.Q' or '.S'. If the length of the command is not 3, then if obj is '.B', elements[obj] is updated to the value of nxt. Otherwise, if obj is a player and the next position is '.B', the player is assigned the value of obj if obj is a player, otherwise it is assigned the value of the player at the next position, and this is printed: "[time] [player] ELIMINATED". If com is 'T', allPlayers[obj] is set to False, and if goalIn(pos) is not -1, team is assigned the value of goalIn(pos), points[team] is increased by 1, and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL'. If com is not 'T', if obj is a player, elements[obj] is updated to the value of nxt. In all cases, elements, points, and allPlayers dictionaries (except for the changes mentioned above), time, and t remain unchanged, stdin remains empty.***
