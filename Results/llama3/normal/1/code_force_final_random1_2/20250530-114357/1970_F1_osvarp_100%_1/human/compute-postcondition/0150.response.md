Postcondition: **The program updates the game state based on the command and object. If the object is '.B' and is a player, it updates the player's position and sets their status to eliminated. If the object is '.B' and is not a player, it checks if the next position is a player and eliminates them if so. If the command is 'T' and the position is within the goal area, it prints a goal message and eliminates the player. The game state is updated accordingly, with the elements dictionary, points, and allPlayers dictionary being modified as necessary.**
