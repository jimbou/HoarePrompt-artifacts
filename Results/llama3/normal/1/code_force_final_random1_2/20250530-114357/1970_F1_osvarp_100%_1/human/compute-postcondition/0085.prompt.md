Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an odd integer between 3 and 99, m is an odd integer between 3 and 99, grid is a list with three elements: the first element is a list of m pairs of characters, the second element is a list of m pairs of characters, and the third element is a list of m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with m+1 key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and line[ind] maps to (i, ind) for each ind in range(m), points is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, stdin contains n-3 lines each with m pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a line with an integer t, i is 2, line is a list with m elements, ind is m-1, allPlayers is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: line[ind] maps to False for each player, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (i, ind) for each 'G' in line. If line[ind] is not '..', then elements[line[ind]] is updated to (i, ind). If line[ind] is a player, then allPlayers[line[ind]] is set to False. If line[ind][1] is 'G', then tmp is 1 and goal[1] contains (i, ind). If line[ind] is not a player, then tmp is 0 if line[ind][0] is 'B', otherwise tmp is 1.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with three elements: the first element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, the second element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, and the third element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with `m+1` key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and `line[ind]` maps to (2, 0) if `line[ind]` is a player, otherwise `line[ind]` maps to (i, ind) for each ind in range(m), `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each with `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a line with an integer t, `i` is 2, `line` is a list with `m` elements that must have at least 1 element, `ind` is 0, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: `line[ind]` maps to False for each player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (i, ind) for each 'G' in line. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to False. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains (i, ind). If `line[ind]` is not a player, then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1, `elements[line[ind]]` is (2, 0), and `line[ind][1]` is 'G'. If `line[ind]` is '..', then no changes are made to `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, or `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with three elements: the first element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, the second element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, and the third element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with `m+1` key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and `line[ind]` maps to (i, ind) for each ind in range(m), `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each with `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a line with an integer t, `i` is 2, `line` is a list with `m` elements that must have at least 2 elements, `ind` is 1, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: `line[ind]` maps to False for each player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (i, ind) for each 'G' in line. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to False. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains (i, ind). If `line[ind]` is not a player, then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If `line[ind]` is not a player and `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1, `elements[line[ind]]` is (2, 0), and `line[ind][1]` is 'G'. If `line[ind]` is '..', then no changes are made to `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, or `tmp`. The value of `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to (i, ind) which is (2, 1). If `line[ind]` is a player, then `tmp` is 0. If `line[ind]` is not a player, then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. `goal[tmp]` contains (i, ind).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with three elements: the first element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, the second element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, and the third element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with `m+1` key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and `line[ind]` maps to (i, ind) for each ind in range(m), `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each with `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a line with an integer t, `i` is 2, `line` is a list with `m` elements that must have at least 2 elements, `ind` is 2, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: `line[ind]` maps to False for each player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (i, ind) for each 'G' in line. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to False and `tmp` is 0. If `line[ind]` is not a player, then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal[tmp]` contains (i, ind). `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to (i, ind) which is (2, 2).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
