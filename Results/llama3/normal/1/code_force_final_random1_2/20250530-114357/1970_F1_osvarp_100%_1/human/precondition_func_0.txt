stdin contains at least 3 inputs: first a line with two integers n and m, then n lines each with m pairs of characters separated by spaces, and finally a line with an integer t. The integers n and m are odd and 3 <= n, m <= 99. The pairs of characters are either ".." or a pair of characters representing a position on the field. The integer t is non-negative and less than or equal to 10000.
