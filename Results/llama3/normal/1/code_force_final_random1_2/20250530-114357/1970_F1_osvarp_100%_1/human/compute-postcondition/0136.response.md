Output State: **`n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with `n` elements: each element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with `m*n+1` key-value pairs: `line[ind]` maps to `(i, ind)` for each `ind` in range(`m`) and each `i` in range(`n`), and '.B' maps to `nxt`, `points` is a list with two elements: if `pos` is within the goal area, then `points` is `[1, 0]`, otherwise `points` is `[0, 0]`, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list with `m` elements, `ind` is `m-1`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: `line[ind]` maps to `False` for each player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: `(i, ind)` for each 'G' in `line`, `obj` is an element of `comand`, `com` is an element of `comand`, `pos` is a tuple of two integers, `nxt` is a tuple of two integers, `mov[com][0]` is an integer, `mov[com][1]` is an integer, `time` is 1, `player` is `obj` if `obj` is a player, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, if `obj` is '.B' and is a player, then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, if `obj` is '.B' and is a player and is within the goal area, then '[time] [player] ELIMINATED' is printed where `time` is 1 and `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, if `com` is 'T', then if `pos` is within the goal area, then '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' is printed where `time` is 1 and `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`, which is not -1 since `pos` is within the goal area.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `points`, `t`, `i`, `line`, `ind`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `obj`, `com`, `pos`, `nxt`, `mov[com][0]`, and `mov[com][1]` remain the same. The value of `player` is updated to `obj` if `obj` is a player, otherwise it is updated to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj` is '.B' and is a player, then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is '.B' and is a player and is within the goal area, then a message is printed indicating that the player is eliminated. If `com` is 'T', then if `pos` is within the goal area, then a message is printed indicating that a goal is scored.
