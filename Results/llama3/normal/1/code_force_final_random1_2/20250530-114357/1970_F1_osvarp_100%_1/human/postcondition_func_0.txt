Simulates a game with two teams, processing commands from standard input and updating the game state accordingly. The game starts with an initial configuration of players and goals, and the simulation runs for a specified number of turns. During each turn, the function processes a command, which can move a player, eliminate a player, score a goal, or catch the golden snitch. The function updates the game state, including player positions, scores, and game status, and prints messages to indicate significant events, such as eliminations, goals, and the final score.
