The code prints a string indicating a goal scored at a specific time. The time is represented by the variable `time`, which is 0. The team that scored the goal is represented by the variable `team`, which is the value returned by the function `goalIn(pos)`.

Since `pos` is within the goal area, `goalIn(pos)` returns a value that is not -1, indicating the team that scored the goal. The team name is retrieved from the dictionary `GoalName` using the team value as the key.

Output: **0 [team name] GOAL (where team name is the name of the team that scored the goal, retrieved from the GoalName dictionary)**
