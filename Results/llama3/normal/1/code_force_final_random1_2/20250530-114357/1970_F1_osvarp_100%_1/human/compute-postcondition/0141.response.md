The code prints a formatted string indicating that a goal has been scored. The string includes the current time, which is 1, and the name of the team that scored the goal, which is determined by the function `goalIn(pos)` and stored in the variable `team`. The `GoalName` dictionary is used to map the team value to its corresponding name.

Output: **1 [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where team is the value returned by goalIn(pos) and GoalName[team] is the name of the team that scored the goal)**
