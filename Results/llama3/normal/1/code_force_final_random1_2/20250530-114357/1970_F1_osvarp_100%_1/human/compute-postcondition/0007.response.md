Output State: **`n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with one element which is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and `line[ind]` maps to (`i`, `ind`), `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair: `line[ind]` maps to False, `goal` is a list of two empty lists, `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines each with `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a line with an integer `t`, `i` is 0, `line` is a list with at least 1 element, `ind` is 0, and the current value of `line[ind]` is a player.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `goal`, `points`, `i`, `line`, `ind` remain the same as in the initial state. The `allPlayers` dictionary now has one key-value pair where the key is the current value of `line[ind]` (which is a player) and the value is False. The stdin still contains `n-1` lines of `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces and a line with an integer `t`.
