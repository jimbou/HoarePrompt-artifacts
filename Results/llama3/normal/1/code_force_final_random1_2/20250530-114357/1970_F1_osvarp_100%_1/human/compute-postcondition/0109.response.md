Output State: **`n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with `n` elements: each element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with `m*n+1` key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and `line[ind]` maps to (`i`, `ind`) for each `ind` in range(`m`) and each `i` in range(`n`), `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list with `m` elements, `ind` is `m-1`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: `line[ind]` maps to False for each player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (`i`, `ind`) for each 'G' in `line`, `obj` is an element of `comand`, `com` is 'T', `pos` is a tuple of two integers, `nxt` is a tuple of two integers, `mov['T'][0]` is an integer, `mov['T'][1]` is an integer, `time` is 0, and `allPlayers[obj]` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `allPlayers[obj]` has been updated to False. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
