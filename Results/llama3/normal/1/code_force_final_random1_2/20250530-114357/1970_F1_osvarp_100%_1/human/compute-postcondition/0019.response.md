Postcondition: ***`n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with one element which is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with three key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1), `line[ind]` maps to (i, ind), and `line[ind]` maps to (0, 1), `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, stdin contains `n-1` lines each with `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a line with an integer t, `i` is 0, `line` is a list with at least 2 elements, `ind` is 1. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair: `line[ind]` maps to False. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one element: (i, ind), and `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary and `goal` is a list of two empty lists. If `line[ind]` is not a player, then `allPlayers` is either a dictionary with one key-value pair: `line[ind]` maps to False if `line[ind]` is a player, or an empty dictionary. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one element: (i, ind). Otherwise, `tmp` is 0, `goal` is a list of two empty lists, and `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary.***
