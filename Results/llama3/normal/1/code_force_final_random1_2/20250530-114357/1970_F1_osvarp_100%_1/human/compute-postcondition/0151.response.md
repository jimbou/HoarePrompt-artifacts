Postcondition: ***The program updates the game state based on the command and object. If the command is a list with 3 elements, then the game state is updated accordingly with the elements dictionary, points, and allPlayers dictionary being modified as necessary. If the command is not a list with 3 elements, then the game state is updated based on the command and object. If the object is '.B' and is a player, it updates the player's position and sets their status to eliminated. If the object is '.B' and is not a player, it checks if the next position is a player and eliminates them if so. If the command is 'T' and the position is within the goal area, it prints a goal message and eliminates the player. If the object is '.Q', then points is a list with two elements: 10 and 0, otherwise if the object is '.S', then the first element is 20 and the second element is 0. The game state is updated accordingly, with the elements dictionary, points, and allPlayers dictionary being modified as necessary.***
