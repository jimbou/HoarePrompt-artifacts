Output State: **n is an odd integer between 3 and 99, m is an odd integer between 3 and 99, grid is a list with one element which is a list of m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with m+1 key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and line[ind] maps to (i, ind) for each ind in range(m), points is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, stdin contains n-1 lines each with m pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a line with an integer t, i is 0, line is a list with m elements, ind is m-1. If line[ind] is a player, then allPlayers is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: line[ind] maps to False for each player. If line[ind][1] is 'G', then goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (i, ind) for each 'G' in line, and tmp is 1. Otherwise, goal is a list of two empty lists, and tmp is 0.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all m elements in the line. The elements dictionary now contains m+1 key-value pairs, including the initial '.B' mapping to (-1, -1) and each line[ind] mapping to (i, ind) for each ind in range(m). The allPlayers dictionary contains one or more key-value pairs for each player in the line, and the goal list contains one or more elements for each 'G' in the line. The tmp variable is 1 if there is at least one 'G' in the line, and 0 otherwise. The other variables remain unchanged.
