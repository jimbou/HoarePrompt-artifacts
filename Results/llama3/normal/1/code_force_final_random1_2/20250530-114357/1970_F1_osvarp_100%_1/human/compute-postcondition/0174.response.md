Postcondition: **The command is split into two strings, obj and com. If obj is '.B' and there is a player at the next position or if obj is a player and the next position is '.B', then the player is assigned the value of obj if obj is a player, otherwise it is assigned the value of the player at the next position, and this is printed: "[time] [player] ELIMINATED". Otherwise, if com is 'T', allPlayers[obj] is set to False, and if goalIn(pos) is not -1, team is assigned the value of goalIn(pos), points[team] is increased by 1, and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL'. If com is not 'T', if obj is a player, elements[obj] is updated to the value of nxt. Otherwise, no changes are made. In all cases, elements, points, and allPlayers dictionaries (except for the changes mentioned above), time, and t remain unchanged, stdin remains empty.**
