Postcondition: ***`n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with three elements: the first element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, the second element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, and the third element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with `m+1` key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and `line[ind]` maps to (i, ind) for each ind in range(m), `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, `stdin` contains `n-3` lines each with `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a line with an integer t, `i` is 2, `line` is a list with `m` elements that must have at least 2 elements, `ind` is 2, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: `line[ind]` maps to False for each player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (i, ind) for each 'G' in line. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[tmp]` contains (i, ind). Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to (i, ind) which is (2, 2).***
