Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when a player scores in the wrong goal (a red player scores in the red goal, or a blue player scores in the blue goal). According to the problem description, in this case, the other team should win a point. However, the program does not check for this condition and does not update the score accordingly.

For example, if the input is:

    3 5
    
    .. .. R0 .. ..
    
    RG .. .Q .. BG
    
    .. .. B0 .. ..
    
    5
    
    R0 D
    
    R0 C .Q
    
    R0 L
    
    R0 L
    
    R0 T

The program will output:

    4 BLUE GOAL
    FINAL SCORE: 0 1

However, the correct output should be:

    4 RED GOAL
    FINAL SCORE: 1 0

Because the red player R0 scored in the red goal, the blue team should win a point.
