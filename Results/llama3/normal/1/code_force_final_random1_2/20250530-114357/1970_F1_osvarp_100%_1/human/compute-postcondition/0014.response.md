The only object in the loop head is variable  ind and line, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable ind and line. If ind is less than the length of line, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, ind is 0, line is a list with at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again ind must be 1 and line must have at least 2 elements.
State: **n is an odd integer between 3 and 99, m is an odd integer between 3 and 99, grid is a list with one element which is a list of m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and line[ind] maps to (i, ind), points is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, stdin contains n-1 lines each with m pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a line with an integer t, i is 0, line is a list with at least 2 elements, ind is 1. If line[ind] is a player, then allPlayers is a dictionary with one key-value pair: line[ind] maps to False. If line[ind][1] is 'G', then goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one element: (i, ind), and tmp is 1. Otherwise, allPlayers is an empty dictionary and goal is a list of two empty lists.**
