#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains at least 3 inputs: first a line with two integers n and m, then n lines each with m pairs of characters separated by spaces, and finally a line with an integer t.

    #State: The loop executes until time equals t. The game state is updated based on the commands and objects. The elements dictionary, points, and allPlayers dictionary are modified as necessary. The time variable is increased by 1 after each iteration. The stdin is empty after the loop finishes. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.

    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the final points values after the loop finishes)

#Overall this is what the function does:Simulates a game with two teams, processing commands from standard input and updating the game state accordingly. The game starts with an initial configuration of players and goals, and the simulation runs for a specified number of turns. During each turn, the function processes a command, which can move a player, eliminate a player, score a goal, or catch the golden snitch. The function updates the game state, including player positions, scores, and game status, and prints messages to indicate significant events, such as eliminations, goals, and the final score.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pos is a position on the field and goal is a list of two lists, where each sublist contains the positions of the goals of a team (0 for red team and 1 for blue team).
    res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
    return res
    #The program returns the value of `res`, which is 0 if `pos` is in the red team's goal, 1 if `pos` is in the blue team's goal, and -1 otherwise.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the team goal status of a given position on the field. It checks if the position is in the red team's goal, the blue team's goal, or neither, and returns a corresponding value (0 for red, 1 for blue, and -1 for neither).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: el is a string of length 2, where the first character is either 'B', 'R', or '.', and the second character is either a digit from 0 to 9 or 'G' or 'Q'.
    res = (el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'
    return res
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the first character of the string 'el' is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function evaluates a given 2-character string 'el' and returns True if the first character is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', otherwise it returns False.
