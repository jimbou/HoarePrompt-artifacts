Output State: **n is an odd integer between 3 and 99, m is an odd integer between 3 and 99, grid is a list with one element which is a list of m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and line[ind] maps to (i, ind), allPlayers is an empty dictionary, points is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, stdin contains n-1 lines each with m pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a line with an integer t, i is 0, line is a list with at least 1 element, ind is 0, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one element: (i, ind), tmp is 1**

The code snippet has the following effects on the program state:

- The variable `tmp` is assigned a value based on the first character of `line[ind]`. Since `line[ind][0]` is not 'B', `tmp` becomes 1.
- The `goal` list is modified by appending the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list at index `tmp`. Since `tmp` is 1, the second list in `goal` now contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.
