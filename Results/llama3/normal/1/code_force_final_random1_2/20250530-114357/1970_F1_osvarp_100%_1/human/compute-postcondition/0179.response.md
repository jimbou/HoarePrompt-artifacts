The `print` statement will print the final score of the game, which consists of two points values, `points[0]` and `points[1]`.

Since the precondition states that the loop executes until time equals t, and the game state is updated based on the commands and objects, it can be inferred that the points values are updated during the loop.

However, the exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not provided in the precondition. Therefore, the output can only be described in terms of the variables.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the final points values after the loop finishes)**
