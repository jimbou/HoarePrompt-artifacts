Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with `n` elements: each element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with `m*n+1` key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and line[ind] maps to (i, ind) for each ind in range(m) and each i in range(n), `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, `t` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list with `m` elements, `ind` is `m-1`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: line[ind] maps to False for each player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (i, ind) for each 'G' in line, stdin contains no input, elements[line[ind]] is updated to (i, ind) which is (n-1, m-1).
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with `n` elements: each element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with `m*n+1` key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and line[ind] maps to (i, ind) for each ind in range(m) and each i in range(n), `points` is a list with two elements: if `el` is '.S', then the first element is 10 and the second element is 0, otherwise if `el` is '.Q', then the first element is 0 and the second element is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list with `m` elements, `ind` is `m-1`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: line[ind] maps to True for the player '.Q' and line[ind] maps to False for each other player if `el` is '.Q', otherwise line[ind] maps to False for each player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (i, ind) for each 'G' in line, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `el` is the third element of `comand`, `comand` is a list with 3 elements, elements[line[ind]] is updated to (i, ind) which is (n-1, m-1), time is 0, and if `el` is '.S', then "0 [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH" is printed. If `comand` is not a list with 3 elements, then `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with `n` elements: each element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with `m*n+1` key-value pairs: `line[ind]` maps to (`i`, `ind`) for each `ind` in range(`m`) and each `i` in range(`n`), and '.B' maps to `nxt`, `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list with `m` elements, `ind` is `m-1`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: `line[ind]` maps to False for each player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (`i`, `ind`) for each 'G' in `line`, `obj` is '.B', `com` is an element of `comand`, `pos` is a tuple of two integers, `nxt` is a tuple of two integers, `mov[com][0]` is an integer, `mov[com][1]` is an integer, `time` is 0. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])`, then `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` and this is printed: '[time] [player] ELIMINATED' where time is 0 and player is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', then `points` is a list with two elements: if `pos` is within the goal area, then `points` is [1, 0], otherwise `points` is [0, 0], and if `pos` is within the goal area, then a message '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' is printed where time is 0 and team is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`, which is not -1 since `pos` is within the goal area. If `com` is not 'T', then `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0. If `obj` is a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Additionally, either `obj` is not '.B' or it is '.B' but `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False, and either `obj` is not a player or it is a player but `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The program updates the game state based on the command and object. If the command is a list with 3 elements, then the game state is updated accordingly with the elements dictionary, points, and allPlayers dictionary being modified as necessary. If the command is not a list with 3 elements, then the game state is updated based on the command and object. If the object is '.B' and is a player, it updates the player's position and sets their status to eliminated. If the object is '.B' and is not a player, it checks if the next position is a player and eliminates them if so. If the command is 'T' and the position is within the goal area, it prints a goal message and eliminates the player. If the object is '.Q', then points is a list with two elements: 10 and 0, otherwise if the object is '.S', then the first element is 20 and the second element is 0. The game state is updated accordingly, with the elements dictionary, points, and allPlayers dictionary being modified as necessary.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The command is a list of strings split by space from the input, object is '.B', '.Q', or '.S', elements dictionary, points, and allPlayers dictionary are modified as necessary, time is increased by 1, t is greater than time, stdin is empty. If the length of the command is 3, then obj is '.B', '.Q', or '.S', com is a string, el is a string, command is a list of strings split by space from the input, object is '.B', '.Q', or '.S', elements dictionary, points, and allPlayers dictionary are modified as necessary, time is increased by 1, t is greater than time, stdin is empty. If el is '.Q', then allPlayers[obj] is True. If el is '.S', then points[0] is increased by 10 if obj is '.B', points[1] is increased by 10 if obj is '.Q' or '.S', and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' where time is the current time and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal for the current team, and team is 1 if obj is '.B', team is 0 if obj is '.Q' or '.S'. If the length of the command is not 3, then if obj is '.B', elements[obj] is updated to the value of nxt. Otherwise, if obj is a player and the next position is '.B', the player is assigned the value of obj if obj is a player, otherwise it is assigned the value of the player at the next position, and this is printed: "[time] [player] ELIMINATED". If com is 'T', allPlayers[obj] is set to False, and if goalIn(pos) is not -1, team is assigned the value of goalIn(pos), points[team] is increased by 1, and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL'. If com is not 'T', if obj is a player, elements[obj] is updated to the value of nxt. In all cases, elements, points, and allPlayers dictionaries (except for the changes mentioned above), time, and t remain unchanged, stdin remains empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
