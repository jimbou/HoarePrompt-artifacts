Output State: **n is an odd integer between 3 and 99, m is an odd integer between 3 and 99, grid is a list with three elements: the first element is a list of m pairs of characters, the second element is a list of m pairs of characters, and the third element is a list of m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with m+1 key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and line[ind] maps to (i, ind) for each ind in range(m), points is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, stdin contains n-4 lines each with m pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a line with an integer t, i is 2, line is a list with m elements that must have at least 2 elements, ind is 1, allPlayers is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: line[ind] maps to False for each player, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (i, ind) for each 'G' in line. If line[ind] is a player, then allPlayers[line[ind]] is set to False. If line[ind][1] is 'G', then tmp is 1 and goal[1] contains (i, ind). If line[ind] is not a player, then tmp is 0 if line[ind][0] is 'B', otherwise tmp is 1. If line[ind] is not a player and line[ind][1] is 'G', then tmp is 1, elements[line[ind]] is (2, 0), and line[ind][1] is 'G'. If line[ind] is '..', then no changes are made to elements, allPlayers, goal, or tmp. The value of elements[line[ind]] is updated to (i, ind) which is (2, 1). tmp is 0 if line[ind][0] is 'B', otherwise tmp is 1. goal[tmp] contains (i, ind).**
