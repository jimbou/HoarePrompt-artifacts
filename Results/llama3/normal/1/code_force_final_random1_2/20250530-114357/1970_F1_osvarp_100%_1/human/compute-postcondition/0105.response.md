The code prints a formatted string indicating that a player has been eliminated at a certain time. The time is given by the value of `time`, which is 0. The player is either `obj` if `obj` is a player or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `obj` is not a player.

Output: **0 [player] ELIMINATED (where player is either obj if obj is a player or grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] if obj is not a player)**
