Postcondition: ***n is an odd integer between 3 and 99, m is an odd integer between 3 and 99, grid is a list with n elements: each element is a list of m pairs of characters, elements is a dictionary with m*n+1 key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and line[ind] maps to (i, ind) for each ind in range(m) and each i in range(n). If com is 'T', then points is a list with two elements: if pos is within the goal area, then points is [1, 0], otherwise points is [0, 0], and if pos is within the goal area, then a message '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' is printed where time is 0 and team is the value returned by goalIn(pos), which is not -1 since pos is within the goal area. If com is not 'T', then points is a list with two elements: 0 and 0. If obj is a player, elements[obj] is updated to nxt. t must be greater than 0, i is n-1, line is a list with m elements, ind is m-1, allPlayers is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: line[ind] maps to False for each player, goal is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (i, ind) for each 'G' in line, obj is an element of comand, com is an element of comand, pos is a tuple of two integers, nxt is a tuple of two integers, mov[com][0] is an integer, mov[com][1] is an integer, time is 0. Additionally, either obj is not '.B' or it is '.B' but isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) is False, and either obj is not a player or it is a player but elements['.B'] is not equal to nxt.***
