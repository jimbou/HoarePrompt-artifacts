Postcondition: ***The command is split into two strings, obj and com, obj is assigned the value of the first element of the command list, com is assigned the value of the second element of the command list, pos is assigned the value of elements[obj], nxt is assigned a tuple containing the sum of pos[0] and mov[com][0], and the sum of pos[1] and mov[com][1]. If com is 'T', allPlayers[obj] is set to False, and if goalIn(pos) is not -1, team is assigned the value of goalIn(pos), points[team] is increased by 1, and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL'. If com is not 'T', if obj is a player, elements[obj] is updated to the value of nxt. Otherwise, no changes are made. In all cases, elements, points, and allPlayers dictionaries (except for the changes mentioned above), time, and t remain unchanged, stdin remains empty.***
