Output State: **`el` is a string of length 2, where the first character is either 'B', 'R', or '.', and the second character is either a digit from 0 to 9 or 'G' or 'Q', `res` is `True` if the first character of `el` is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', otherwise `res` is `False`.**

In this output state, the value of `el` remains the same as in the initial state, but a new variable `res` is introduced. The value of `res` is determined by the condition `(el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'`. This means that if the first character of `el` is either 'B' or 'R', and the second character is not 'G', then `res` is `True`. Otherwise, `res` is `False`.
