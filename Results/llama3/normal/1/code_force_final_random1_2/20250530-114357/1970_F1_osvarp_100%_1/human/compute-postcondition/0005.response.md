Output State: **`n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with one element which is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and `line[ind]` maps to (`i`, `ind`), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list of two empty lists, `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, `stdin` contains `n-1` lines each with `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a line with an integer `t`, `i` is 0, `line` is a list with at least 1 element, `ind` is 0, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, `points`, `stdin`, `i`, `line`, and `ind` remain unchanged. The `elements` dictionary now has an additional key-value pair where the key is the current value of `line[ind]` (which is not '..') and the value is a tuple containing the current value of `i` (which is 0) and the current value of `ind` (which is 0).
