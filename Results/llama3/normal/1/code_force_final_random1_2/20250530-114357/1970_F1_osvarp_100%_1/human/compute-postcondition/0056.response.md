Output State: **`n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with two elements: the first element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, and the second element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with `m+1` key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and `line[ind]` maps to (i, ind) for each ind in range(m), `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, `stdin` contains `n-2` lines each with `m` pairs of characters separated by spaces, and a line with an integer t, `i` is 1, `line` is a list with `m` elements, `ind` is `m-1`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: `line[ind]` maps to False for each player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (i, ind) for each 'G' in line. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `elements[line[ind]]` is updated to (i, ind). If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to False. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains (i, ind). If `line[ind]` is not a player, then `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The loop iterates over each element in the `line` list, which has `m` elements.
*   For each element `line[ind]` that is not '..', the `elements` dictionary is updated to map `line[ind]` to the tuple `(i, ind)`.
*   If `line[ind]` is a player, the `allPlayers` dictionary is updated to set `line[ind]` to False.
*   If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', the `tmp` variable is set to 1 and the `goal[1]` list is updated to contain the tuple `(i, ind)`.
*   If `line[ind]` is not a player, the `tmp` variable is set to 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise it is set to 1.
*   The `ind` variable is updated to `m-1` after the loop finishes executing.
*   The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
