Postcondition: **`n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with `n` elements: each element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with `m*n+1` key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and line[ind] maps to (i, ind) for each ind in range(m) and each i in range(n), `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list with `m` elements, `ind` is `m-1`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: line[ind] maps to False for each player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (i, ind) for each 'G' in line, `comand` is a list with 3 elements, elements[line[ind]] is updated to (i, ind) which is (n-1, m-1), time is 0.**
