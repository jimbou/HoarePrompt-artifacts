Output State: **`n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with `n` elements: each element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with `m*n+1` key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and `line[ind]` maps to (`i`, `ind`) for each `ind` in range(`m`) and each `i` in range(`n`), `points` is a list with two elements: 1 and 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list with `m` elements, `ind` is `m-1`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: `line[ind]` maps to False for each player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (`i`, `ind`) for each 'G' in `line`, `obj` is an element of `comand`, `com` is 'T', `pos` is a tuple of two integers, `nxt` is a tuple of two integers, `mov['T'][0]` is an integer, `mov['T'][1]` is an integer, `time` is 0, `allPlayers[obj]` is False, and `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`, which is not -1 since `pos` is within the goal area, and this is printed: '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' where time is 0 and team is the value returned by goalIn(pos) which is not -1 since pos is within the goal area.**

The code increments the value of `points[team]` by 1. Since `team` is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`, which is not -1 since `pos` is within the goal area, `points[team]` is incremented to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
