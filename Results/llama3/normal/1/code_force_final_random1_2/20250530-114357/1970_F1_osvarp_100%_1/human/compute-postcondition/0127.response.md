Output State: **`n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with `n` elements: each element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with `m*n+1` key-value pairs: '.B' maps to (-1, -1) and line[ind] maps to (i, ind) for each ind in range(m) and each i in range(n), `points` is a list with two elements: if `el` is '.S', then the first element is 10 and the second element is 0, otherwise if `el` is '.Q', then the first element is 0 and the second element is 0, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list with `m` elements, `ind` is `m-1`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: line[ind] maps to True for the player '.Q' and line[ind] maps to False for each other player if `el` is '.Q', otherwise line[ind] maps to False for each player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (i, ind) for each 'G' in line, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `el` is the third element of `comand`, `comand` is a list with 3 elements, elements[line[ind]] is updated to (i, ind) which is (n-1, m-1), time is 1, and if `el` is '.S', then "0 [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH" is printed. If `comand` is not a list with 3 elements, then `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an odd integer between 3 and 99, `grid` is a list with `n` elements: each element is a list of `m` pairs of characters, `elements` is a dictionary with `m*n+1` key-value pairs: `line[ind]` maps to (`i`, `ind`) for each `ind` in range(`m`) and each `i` in range(`n`), and '.B' maps to `nxt`, `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list with `m` elements, `ind` is `m-1`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one or more key-value pairs: `line[ind]` maps to False for each player, `goal` is a list of two lists where the first list is empty and the second list contains one or more elements: (`i`, `ind`) for each 'G' in `line`, `obj` is '.B', `com` is an element of `comand`, `pos` is a tuple of two integers, `nxt` is a tuple of two integers, `mov[com][0]` is an integer, `mov[com][1]` is an integer, `time` is 1. If `obj` is '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])`, then `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` and this is printed: '[time] [player] ELIMINATED' where time is 1 and player is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', then `points` is a list with two elements: if `pos` is within the goal area, then `points` is [1, 0], otherwise `points` is [0, 0], and if `pos` is within the goal area, then a message '[time] [GoalName[team]] GOAL' is printed where time is 1 and team is the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`, which is not -1 since `pos` is within the goal area. If `com` is not 'T', then `points` is a list with two elements: 0 and 0. If `obj` is a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. Additionally, either `obj` is not '.B' or it is '.B' but `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False, and either `obj` is not a player or it is a player but `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.**

The output state is the same as the initial state, except that `comand` is now a list with 3 elements, and `obj`, `com`, and `el` are updated accordingly. The values of the other variables are not affected.
