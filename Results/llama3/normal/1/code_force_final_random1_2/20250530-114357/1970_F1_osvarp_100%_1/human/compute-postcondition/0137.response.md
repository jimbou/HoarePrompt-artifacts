The code prints a formatted string indicating that a player has been eliminated. The string includes the current time, which is 1, and the name of the player, which is the value of the `player` variable.

Since `obj` is '.B' and is a player, and `obj` is within the goal area, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Therefore, the `player` variable holds the value of the element at position `nxt` in the `grid` list.

Output: **1 [grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]] ELIMINATED (where grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]] is the value of the player at position nxt in the grid)**
