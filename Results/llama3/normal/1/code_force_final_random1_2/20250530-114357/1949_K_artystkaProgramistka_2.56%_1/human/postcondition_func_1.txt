This function takes a list of positive integers and three positive integers (na, nb, nc) as input, where the sum of na, nb, and nc equals the length of the list. It sorts the list in descending order and distributes the numbers into three groups (group_a, group_b, group_c) with na, nb, and nc elements respectively. The function then checks if the sums of the elements in each group satisfy a certain condition (func_1). If the condition is met, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
