Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is an empty list, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists with `na`, `nb`, and `nc` elements respectively, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` respectively, and `num` is the last number in the original list. The current value of `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` satisfies the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)`.**
