Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a sorted list of `n-1` positive integers in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists with one more element, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are updated accordingly, `num` is the third number in the original list, and the function `distribute_number(num)` has been executed.**

In this output state, the function `distribute_number(num)` has been executed, which means that the number `num` has been distributed among the groups `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. The exact distribution is not specified, but it is assumed that the function has updated the counts `na`, `nb`, and `nc` accordingly. The sums `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` have also been updated to reflect the new distribution of numbers. The other variables remain unchanged.
