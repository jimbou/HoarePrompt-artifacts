Output State: **n is a positive integer, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na + nb + nc = n, numbers is a sorted list of n positive integers in descending order, group_a, group_b, and group_c are empty lists, and sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are 0.**

The code sorts the list of numbers in descending order, and initializes three empty groups and their corresponding sums to 0. The values of n, na, nb, and nc remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
