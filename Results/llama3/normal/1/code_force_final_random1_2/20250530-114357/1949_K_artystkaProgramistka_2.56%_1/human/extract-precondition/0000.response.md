Precondition: **num is a positive integer, group_a, group_b, and group_c are lists of positive integers, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na + nb + nc = len(group_a) + len(group_b) + len(group_c), and sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are non-negative integers representing the sums of the numbers in group_a, group_b, and group_c respectively.**
