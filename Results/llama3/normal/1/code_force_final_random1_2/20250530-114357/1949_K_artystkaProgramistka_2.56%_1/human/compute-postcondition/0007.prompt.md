Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that na + nb + nc = n, numbers is a sorted list of n positive integers in descending order, group_a, group_b, and group_c are empty lists, and sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are 0.
Code of the loop:
for num in numbers:
    distribute_number(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a sorted list of `n-1` positive integers in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists with one more element, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are updated accordingly, `num` is the second number in the original list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a sorted list of `n-1` positive integers in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists with one more element, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are updated accordingly, `num` is the third number in the original list, and the function `distribute_number(num)` has been executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a sorted list of `n-3` positive integers in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists with one more element, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are updated accordingly, `num` is the fifth number in the original list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
