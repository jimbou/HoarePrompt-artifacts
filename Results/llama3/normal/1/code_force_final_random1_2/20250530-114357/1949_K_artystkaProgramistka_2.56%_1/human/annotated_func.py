#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are positive integers representing the sides of a triangle.
    return a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a
    #The program returns True if the sum of the lengths of any two sides of the triangle is greater than the length of the third side, and False otherwise.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether three positive integers can form a valid triangle by checking if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side, returning True if the condition is met and False otherwise.

        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES' and three lists: group_a with na elements, group_b with nb elements, and group_c with nc elements, where na + nb + nc = n. The sums of the elements in these lists, sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c, satisfy the condition func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c).
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns string 'NO'

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of positive integers and three positive integers (na, nb, nc) as input, where the sum of na, nb, and nc equals the length of the list. It sorts the list in descending order and distributes the numbers into three groups (group_a, group_b, group_c) with na, nb, and nc elements respectively. The function then checks if the sums of the elements in each group satisfy a certain condition (func_1). If the condition is met, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
