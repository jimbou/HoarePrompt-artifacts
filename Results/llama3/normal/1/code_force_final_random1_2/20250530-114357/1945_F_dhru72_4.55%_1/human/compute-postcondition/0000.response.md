Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). The second line contains a list of n integers (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9) representing the magic powers of the mushrooms. The third line contains a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n, T is a type variable.**

In this output state, the code defines a type variable T, which can be used to represent any type. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines: an integer n, a list of n integers representing the magic powers of the mushrooms, and a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n.
