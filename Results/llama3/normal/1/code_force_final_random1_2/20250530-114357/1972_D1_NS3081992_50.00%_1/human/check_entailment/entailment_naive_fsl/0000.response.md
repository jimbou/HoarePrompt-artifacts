Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.

The program uses a brute force approach, iterating over all possible values of a and b, and checking if the conditions are met. However, this approach is not efficient and does not correctly handle all cases.

For example, when n = 10 and m = 8, the program returns 14, but the correct answer is 15. The pair (10, 2) is not counted by the program, but it satisfies the conditions.

A correct solution would involve using a more efficient algorithm, such as using the properties of greatest common divisors (GCDs) to reduce the number of pairs that need to be checked.
