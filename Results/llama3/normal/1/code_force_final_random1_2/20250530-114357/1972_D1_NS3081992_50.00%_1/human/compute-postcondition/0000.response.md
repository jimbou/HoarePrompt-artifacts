The only variables in the loop head are the variable `_` and the function `func_10()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of `func_10()`. If `func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `func_10()` returns a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 0 and `_` is now 0 (since it's the first iteration).

State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0**
