Output State: **The program returns the original value of ans plus the sum of the integer divisions of (n + k) by k squared for k from 1 to the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, minus 1.**

In this output state, 'ans' is the original value of 'ans' plus the sum of the integer divisions of (n + k) by k squared for k from 1 to the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, minus 1. The value of 'n' is a positive integer, and 'i' is the smallest integer greater than the square root of 'n'.
