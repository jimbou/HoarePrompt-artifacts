The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and the result of `func_10()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of `func_10()`. If the result of `func_10()` is greater than 0 the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, the result of `func_10()` is greater than 0, _ is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the result of `func_10()` must be greater than 1 and _ is 1.
State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, and the standard output contains the result of `func_15()` as a string followed by a newline character.**
