Output State: **The loop finishes executing after `func_10()` number of iterations, `_` is `func_10()` - 1, and the standard output contains `func_10()` number of results of `func_15()` as strings followed by newline characters.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will continue to execute until it has iterated `func_10()` number of times. After each iteration, the result of `func_15()` is printed to the standard output followed by a newline character. Once the loop finishes executing, the variable `_` will be equal to `func_10()` - 1, and the standard output will contain `func_10()` number of results of `func_15()` as strings followed by newline characters.
