This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key `da` in a dictionary `d`, where the rank is determined by recursively processing the associated list of integers and updating the `rank` list accordingly. The function takes as input a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. If the list associated with `da` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updates the `processing` list, and recursively calls `func_12` to calculate the minimum rank. The function returns the minimum rank plus one, which is stored in the `rank` list.
