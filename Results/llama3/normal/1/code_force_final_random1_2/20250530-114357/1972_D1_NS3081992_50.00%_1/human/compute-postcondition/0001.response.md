Output State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, and the standard output contains the result of `func_15()` as a string followed by a newline character.**

In this output state, the values of `func_10()` and `_` remain unchanged. The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the result of `func_15()` as a string to the standard output, followed by a newline character. The result of `func_15()` is not specified in the initial state, so it is not possible to determine its exact value. However, it is known that the result is written to the standard output as a string.
