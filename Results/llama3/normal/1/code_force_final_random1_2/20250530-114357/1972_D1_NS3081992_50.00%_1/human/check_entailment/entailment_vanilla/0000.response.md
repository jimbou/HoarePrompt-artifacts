Reasoning:

The problem asks us to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The given program uses a different approach to solve the problem. It uses the fact that the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions is equal to the number of divisors of n + i, where i ranges from 1 to sqrt(n + i).

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program:

1.  The program defines several functions for reading input, but only `func_7` and `func_15` are used in the main function `func_16`.
2.  `func_15` calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions. It uses a loop to iterate over all possible values of i such that i \* i ≤ n + i. For each i, it calculates the number of divisors of n + i and adds it to the answer.
3.  `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case.

The program is correct because it uses the correct mathematical formula to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions. The formula is based on the fact that the number of ordered pairs (a, b) is equal to the number of divisors of n + i, where i ranges from 1 to sqrt(n + i).

However, the program can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm to calculate the number of divisors of n + i. The current implementation has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n + i)), which can be improved to O(log(n + i)) using a more efficient algorithm.

Correctness: **True**
