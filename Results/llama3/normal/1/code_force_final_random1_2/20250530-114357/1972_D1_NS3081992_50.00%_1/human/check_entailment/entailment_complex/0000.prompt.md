Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, processing is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in d, da is an integer representing a key in d, and rank is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in d.

    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns integer 1.
    #State: *`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `da` is an integer representing a key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, and `tmp` is an integer equal to 10 to the power of 9. The list of integers associated with the key `da` in `d` has more than one element.
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer and each value is a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `da` is an integer representing a key in `d`, `rank` is a list of integers of the same length as the number of keys in `d`, `tmp` is an integer equal to 10 to the power of 9, and the list of integers associated with the key `da` in `d` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, `di` is the last element in the list of integers associated with the key `da` in `d`. If the value at index `di - 1` in `processing` is 0, then `tmp` is updated to the minimum of 10 to the power of 9 and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns tmp + 1, where tmp is an integer equal to 10 to the power of 9 or the minimum of 10 to the power of 9 and the result of func_12(d, processing, di, rank) if the value at index di - 1 in processing is 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key `da` in a dictionary `d`, where the rank is determined by recursively processing the associated list of integers and updating the `rank` list accordingly. The function takes as input a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. If the list associated with `da` has only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, updates the `processing` list, and recursively calls `func_12` to calculate the minimum rank. The function returns the minimum rank plus one, which is stored in the `rank` list.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.

    #State: a and b are positive integers, and b is not equal to 0
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns a tuple containing three values: y, x - a // b * y, and g. Here, y is the second return value of func_13(b, a % b), x is the first return value of func_13(b, a % b), a // b is the integer division of a by b, and g is the third return value of func_13(b, a % b).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b, along with the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, it returns 1, 0, and a. Otherwise, it recursively calls another function to compute the GCD and coefficients.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n and m are non-negative integers, and k is an integer. The length of list a is equal to n.
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer, m is a non-negative integer, the length of list a is equal to n. k is decreased by the sum of m - a[i] for all i where a[i] is less than m.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1.
    #State: *a is a list of integers, n is a non-negative integer, m is a non-negative integer, the length of list a is equal to n. k is decreased by the sum of m - a[i] for all i where a[i] is less than m. k is less than 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function evaluates a list of integers against a threshold value and returns an indication of whether a cumulative adjustment to a counter variable remains non-negative. It takes a list of integers, a non-negative integer length, a non-negative integer threshold, and an integer counter as input. The function iterates through the list, subtracting the difference between the threshold and each element from the counter if the element is less than the threshold. If the counter remains non-negative after all adjustments, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the input list.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, and the values of n and m are previously calculated by function func_7().
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, i is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, ans is the original value of ans plus the sum of the integer divisions of (n + k) by k squared for k from 1 to the smallest integer greater than the square root of n.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the original value of ans plus the sum of the integer divisions of (n + k) by k squared for k from 1 to the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, minus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the sum of integer divisions of (n + k) by k squared for k from 1 to the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, minus 1, where n is a previously calculated positive integer.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function func_10() returns a positive integer and the function func_15() returns a string.
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The loop finishes executing after `func_10()` number of iterations, `_` is `func_10()` - 1, and the standard output contains `func_10()` number of results of `func_15()` as strings followed by newline characters.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function writes a specified number of strings to the standard output, each followed by a newline character. The number of strings written is determined by the return value of `func_10()`, and the content of each string is determined by the return value of `func_15()`. The function does not return any value, but modifies the standard output.
