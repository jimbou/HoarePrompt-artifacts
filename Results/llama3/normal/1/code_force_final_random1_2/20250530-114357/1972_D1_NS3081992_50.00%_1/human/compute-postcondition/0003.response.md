Output State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, and the standard output contains the result of `func_15()` as a string followed by a newline character, and then another result of `func_15()` as a string followed by a newline character.**

In this output state, the values of `func_10()` and `_` remain unchanged. The standard output, however, is updated to include another result of `func_15()` as a string followed by a newline character, in addition to the previous result of `func_15()` as a string followed by a newline character.
