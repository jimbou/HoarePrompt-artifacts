Output State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, and the standard output contains the result of `func_15()` as a string followed by a newline character, and then another result of `func_15()` as a string followed by a newline character, and then another result of `func_15()` as a string followed by a newline character, and then another result of `func_15()` as a string followed by a newline character.**

The code writes the result of `func_15()` as a string followed by a newline character to the standard output. Since the standard output already contains the result of `func_15()` as a string followed by a newline character three times, the new output will be appended to the existing output, resulting in a total of four results of `func_15()` as strings followed by newline characters. The values of `func_10()` and `_` remain unchanged.
