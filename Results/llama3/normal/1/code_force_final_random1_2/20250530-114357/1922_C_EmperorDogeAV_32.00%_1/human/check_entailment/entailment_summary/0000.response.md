Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities. The program first calculates the closest city for each city and stores the distances in the `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` lists. Then, it calculates the prefix sums of these distances to efficiently calculate the total distance between any two cities.

The program handles the cases where the source city is less than the destination city and vice versa correctly by using the `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` lists respectively.

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the closest city for each city and returns the list of distances. The program also correctly handles the edge cases where the source city is the first city or the destination city is the last city.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all the edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
