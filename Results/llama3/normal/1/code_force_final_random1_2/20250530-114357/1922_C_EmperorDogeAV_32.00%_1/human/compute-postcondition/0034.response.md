Functionality: This function takes a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order and a non-negative integer n as input, where n is less than the length of the list. It returns a list of length n-1, where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between two consecutive elements in the input list. The function compares the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the input list and sets the corresponding element in the output list to 1 if the difference between the current element and the next element is less than the difference between the current element and the previous element, otherwise it sets the element to the absolute difference between the current element and the next element.
