The code changes the value of the variable `forward` to the value of `cities[i + 1]`. The value of `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, and `n` is at least `i + 2`. The list `cities` is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order. Therefore, the value of `forward` is the (i+1)th element of `cities`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `prog_cities` is a list of length `n - 1`, `back` is the (i-1)th element of `cities` if `i > 0`, otherwise `back` is -99999999, and `forward` is the (i+1)th element of `cities`.**
