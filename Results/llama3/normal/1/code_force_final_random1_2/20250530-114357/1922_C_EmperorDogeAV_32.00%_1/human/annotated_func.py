    #State: cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities), prog_cities is a list of length n - 1. For each i from 0 to n - 2, if the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the (i-1)th element of cities, the ith element of prog_cities is 1. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list of length n - 1, where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between two consecutive elements in the list 'cities', depending on the comparison of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in 'cities'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order and an integer n as input, and returns a list of length n-1. Each element in the returned list is either 1 or the absolute difference between two consecutive elements in the input list, depending on whether the absolute difference between the current element and its next element is less than the absolute difference between the current element and its previous element. If the condition is met, the element is 1; otherwise, it is the absolute difference between the current element and its next element.
