Output State: **cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of zeros with length n - 1, i is 0, back is -99999999, forward is 99999999**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to the variables `back` and `forward`. The first line sets `back` to -99999999, and the second line sets `forward` to 99999999. These assignments do not affect the values of the other variables in the initial state.

The initial state variables `cities`, `n`, `prog_cities`, and `i` remain unchanged, as there are no operations or assignments that modify their values in the given code snippet. Therefore, the final output state includes the updated values of `back` and `forward`, along with the unchanged values of the other variables.
