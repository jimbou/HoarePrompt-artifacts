Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities), prog_cities is a list of zeros with length n - 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    back = -99999999
    forward = 99999999
    if i > 0:
        back = cities[i - 1]
    if i < n - 1:
        forward = cities[i + 1]
    if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
        prog_cities[i] = 1
    else:
        prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cities` is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, then if `i` is greater than 0, `back` is a distinct non-negative integer in ascending order and `forward` is the `(i+2)th` element of `cities`. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `forward` is the 1st element of `cities`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1`, then no changes are made. The list `prog_cities` has a length of `n - 1`. If the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, then the `i-th` element of `prog_cities` is 1 and the rest are 0. Otherwise, the `i-th` element of `prog_cities` is the absolute difference between the `(i+1)th` element of `cities` and the `i-th` element of `cities`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cities` is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `prog_cities` is a list of length `n - 1`. If `i < n - 1`, `back` is the `(i-1)`th element of `cities` if `i > 0`, otherwise `back` is -99999999, and `forward` is the `(i+1)`th element of `cities`. If `i >= n - 1`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The `i`th element of `prog_cities` is 1 if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, otherwise it is the absolute difference between the `(i+1)`th element of `cities` and the `i`th element of `cities`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least i + 2, i is either 1 or greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of length n - 1. If the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the (i-1)th element of cities, the ith element of prog_cities is 1. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities. If i is greater than 0, back is the i-1th element of cities, otherwise back remains -99999999. If i is less than n - 1, forward is the i+1th element of cities, otherwise forward remains 99999999.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
