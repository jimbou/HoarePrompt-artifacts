Output State: **cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list with i-th element as 1 and the rest as 0, if i is less than n - 1, then if i is greater than 0, back is a distinct non-negative integer in ascending order and forward is the (i+2)th element of cities. Otherwise, i is 0 and forward is the 1st element of cities. If i is not less than n - 1, then no changes are made. The current value of forward is closer to cities[i] than the current value of back is to cities[i].**

In this output state, the value of prog_cities[i] has been updated to 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list prog_cities now has a 1 at the i-th index, and the rest of the elements are still 0. The other conditions and relationships between the variables, such as the order of the cities list and the relationship between forward and back, are still valid.
