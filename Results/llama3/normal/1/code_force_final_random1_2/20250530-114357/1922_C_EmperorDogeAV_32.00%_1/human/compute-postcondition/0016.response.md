Output State: **cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least i + 2, i is either 0 or greater than 0, back is the i-1th element of cities, forward is 99999999, and prog_cities is a list of length n - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `back` has been updated to the i-1th element of `cities`, which is a distinct non-negative integer. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
