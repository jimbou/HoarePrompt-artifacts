Postcondition: ***cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least i + 2, i is either 0 or greater than 0, prog_cities is a list of length n - 1. If i < n - 1, back is the (i-1)th element of cities if i > 0, otherwise back is -99999999, and forward is the (i+1)th element of cities. If i >= n - 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
