Output State: **cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of zeros with length n - 1. The current value of i is less than n - 1. If i is greater than 0, back is a distinct non-negative integer in ascending order and forward is the (i+2)th element of cities. Otherwise, i is 0 and forward is the 1st element of cities.**

In this output state, the value of forward has been updated to be the (i+2)th element of cities if i is greater than 0, or the 1st element of cities if i is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
