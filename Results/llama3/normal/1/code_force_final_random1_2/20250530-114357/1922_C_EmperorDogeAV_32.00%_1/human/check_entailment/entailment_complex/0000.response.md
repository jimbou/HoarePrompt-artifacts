Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another. The function `func_1` calculates the minimum cost to travel to the next city for each city, and the main program uses this information to calculate the minimum cost to travel from one city to another.

The program first calculates the minimum cost to travel to the next city for each city in the forward direction, and then reverses the list of cities and calculates the minimum cost to travel to the next city in the backward direction. It then uses these two lists to calculate the minimum cost to travel from one city to another.

The program handles the case where the destination city is to the right of the source city by subtracting the prefix sum of the forward costs from the prefix sum of the backward costs. Similarly, it handles the case where the destination city is to the left of the source city by subtracting the prefix sum of the backward costs from the prefix sum of the forward costs.

The program assumes that the input is valid, i.e., the list of cities is in ascending order and the source and destination cities are distinct. It also assumes that the number of test cases, the number of cities, and the number of queries are all non-negative integers.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
