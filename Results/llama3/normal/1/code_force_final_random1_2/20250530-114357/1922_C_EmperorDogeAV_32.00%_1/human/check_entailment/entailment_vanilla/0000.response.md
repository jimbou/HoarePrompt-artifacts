Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. The program first calculates the closest city for each city and then calculates the prefix sum of the distances between cities in both forward and backward directions.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the closest city for each city. This function iterates through the list of cities and for each city, it checks if the next city is closer or the previous city is closer. If the next city is closer, it sets the distance to 1, otherwise, it sets the distance to the absolute difference between the current city and the next city.

The program then calculates the prefix sum of the distances between cities in both forward and backward directions using the `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` lists. These lists are used to store the cumulative sum of the distances between cities.

Finally, the program reads the queries and for each query, it checks if the destination city is greater than the source city. If it is, it calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel from the source city to the destination city by subtracting the prefix sum of the source city from the prefix sum of the destination city in the forward direction. If the destination city is less than the source city, it calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel from the source city to the destination city by subtracting the prefix sum of the source city from the prefix sum of the destination city in the backward direction.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all the edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
