Output State: **cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least i + 2, i is either 1 or greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of length n - 1, back is the i-1th element of cities, forward is 99999999.**

In this output state, the value of `back` has been updated to be the `i-1`th element of the `cities` list, which is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
