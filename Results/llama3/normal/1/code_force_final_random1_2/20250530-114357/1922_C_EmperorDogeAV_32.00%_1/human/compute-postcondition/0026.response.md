Postcondition: ***cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least i + 2, i is either 1 or greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of length n - 1. If i is greater than 0, back is the i-1th element of cities, otherwise back remains -99999999. forward is always 99999999.***
