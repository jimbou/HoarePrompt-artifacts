Output State: **cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least i + 2, i is either 0 or greater than 0, back is -99999999, forward is 99999999, and prog_cities is a list of length n - 1.**

The code snippet assigns new values to the variables `back` and `forward`, but does not modify the values of `cities`, `n`, `i`, or `prog_cities`. The new values of `back` and `forward` are -99999999 and 99999999, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial state.
