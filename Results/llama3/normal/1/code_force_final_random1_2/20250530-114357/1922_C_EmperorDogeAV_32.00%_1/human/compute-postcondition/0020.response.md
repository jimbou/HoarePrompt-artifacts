Output State: **`cities` is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `prog_cities` is a list of length `n - 1` where the `i`th element is 1, and if `i < n - 1`, `back` is the `(i-1)`th element of `cities` if `i > 0`, otherwise `back` is -99999999, and `forward` is the `(i+1)`th element of `cities`. If `i >= n - 1`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of cities remains unchanged, the value of n remains the same, and the value of i also remains the same. The list prog_cities has been updated such that its ith element is now 1. The values of back and forward remain the same as before, unless i is greater than or equal to n-1, in which case they remain unchanged.
