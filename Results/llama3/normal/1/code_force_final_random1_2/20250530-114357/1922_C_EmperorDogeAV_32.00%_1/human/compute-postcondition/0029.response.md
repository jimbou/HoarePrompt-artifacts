Output State: **`cities` is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `i` is either 1 or greater than 1, `prog_cities` is a list of length `n - 1` where the `i`th element is 1, if `i` is greater than 0, `back` is the `i-1`th element of `cities`, otherwise `back` remains -99999999, if `i` is less than `n - 1`, `forward` is the `i+1`th element of `cities`, otherwise `forward` remains 99999999.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of cities remains unchanged, the value of n and i also remains the same. The list prog_cities has been updated such that its ith element is now 1. The values of back and forward remain the same as they were before the execution of the code.
