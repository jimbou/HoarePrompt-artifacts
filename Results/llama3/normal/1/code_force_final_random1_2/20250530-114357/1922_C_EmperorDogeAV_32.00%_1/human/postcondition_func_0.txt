This function takes a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order and an integer n as input, and returns a list of length n-1. Each element in the returned list is either 1 or the absolute difference between two consecutive elements in the input list, depending on whether the absolute difference between the current element and its next element is less than the absolute difference between the current element and its previous element. If the condition is met, the element is 1; otherwise, it is the absolute difference between the current element and its next element.
