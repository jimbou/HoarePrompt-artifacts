Output State: **cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities), prog_cities is a list of zeros with length n - 1**

In this output state, the list `prog_cities` has been created with `n - 1` elements, all initialized to zero. The values of `cities` and `n` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The length of `prog_cities` is `n - 1`, which is a non-negative integer since `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n < len(cities)`.
