Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities. The function `func_1` calculates the minimum cost to travel from one city to the next city, and the main program uses this function to calculate the prefix sums of the minimum costs in both forward and backward directions. The program then uses these prefix sums to answer the queries.

The program correctly handles the case where the closest city is determined uniquely, and it also handles the case where the cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is unique.

The program also correctly calculates the minimum cost to travel from one city to another city, by using the prefix sums of the minimum costs in both forward and backward directions.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
