Output State: **cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least i + 2, i is either 1 or greater than 1, prog_cities is a list of length n - 1 where the ith element is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities, If i is greater than 0, back is the i-1th element of cities, otherwise back remains -99999999. If i is less than n - 1, forward is the i+1th element of cities, otherwise forward remains 99999999.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of cities remains unchanged, the value of n and i also remains the same. The list prog_cities has been updated where the ith element is now the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities. The values of back and forward also remain the same as they were before the execution of the code.
