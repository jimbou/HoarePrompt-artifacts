Postcondition: **cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of zeros with length n - 1. If i is less than n - 1, then if i is greater than 0, back is a distinct non-negative integer in ascending order and forward is the (i+2)th element of cities. Otherwise, i is 0 and forward is the 1st element of cities. If i is not less than n - 1, then no changes are made. The current value of forward is closer to cities[i] than the current value of back is to cities[i].**
