State: **`cities` is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `i` is either 1 or greater than 1, `prog_cities` is a list of length `n - 1`. If `i < n - 1`, `back` is the `i`th element of `cities` if `i > 0`, otherwise `back` is -99999999, and `forward` is the `(i+2)`th element of `cities`. If `i >= n - 1`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The `(i+1)`th element of `prog_cities` is 1 if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i+1]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i+1]` and `back`, otherwise it is the absolute difference between the `(i+2)`th element of `cities` and the `(i+1)`th element of `cities`.**
