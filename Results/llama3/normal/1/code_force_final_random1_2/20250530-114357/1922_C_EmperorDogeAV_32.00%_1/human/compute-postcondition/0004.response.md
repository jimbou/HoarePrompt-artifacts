The code assigns the value of `cities[i - 1]` to `back`. Since `i` is greater than 0, `i - 1` is a valid index for the list `cities`. The value of `cities[i - 1]` is a distinct non-negative integer in ascending order.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `prog_cities` is a list of zeros with length `n - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `back` is a distinct non-negative integer in ascending order, `forward` is 99999999**
