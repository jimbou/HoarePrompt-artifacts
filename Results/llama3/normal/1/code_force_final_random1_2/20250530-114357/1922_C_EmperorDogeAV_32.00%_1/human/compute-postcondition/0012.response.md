Output State: **`cities` is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2, `prog_cities` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n - 1` where the `i-th` element is the absolute difference between the `(i+1)th` element of `cities` and the `i-th` element of `cities`, `i` is either less than `n - 1` or not less than `n - 1`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, then if `i` is greater than 0, `back` is a distinct non-negative integer in ascending order and `forward` is the `(i+2)th` element of `cities`. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `forward` is the 1st element of `cities`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1`, then no changes are made. The absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`.**

In this output state, the value of `prog_cities[i]` has been updated to be the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `i`, `back`, and `forward` are still valid, and the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is still greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`.
