The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities), prog_cities is a list of zeros with length n - 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 2 and i is now 0. 
State: **cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of zeros with length n - 1, i is 0**
