Postcondition: **`cities` is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `n` is at least 2. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, then if `i` is greater than 0, `back` is a distinct non-negative integer in ascending order and `forward` is the `(i+2)th` element of `cities`. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `forward` is the 1st element of `cities`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1`, then no changes are made. The list `prog_cities` has a length of `n - 1`. If the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, then the `i-th` element of `prog_cities` is 1 and the rest are 0. Otherwise, the `i-th` element of `prog_cities` is the absolute difference between the `(i+1)th` element of `cities` and the `i-th` element of `cities`.**
