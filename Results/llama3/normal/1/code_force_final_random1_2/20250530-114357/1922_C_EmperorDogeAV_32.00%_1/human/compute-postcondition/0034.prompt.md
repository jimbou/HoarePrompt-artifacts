You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities).
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        
        forward = 99999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(cities), prog_cities is a list of length n - 1. For each i from 0 to n - 2, if the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities is less than the absolute difference between the ith element of cities and the (i-1)th element of cities, the ith element of prog_cities is 1. Otherwise, the ith element of prog_cities is the absolute difference between the (i+1)th element of cities and the ith element of cities.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list of length n - 1, where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between two consecutive elements in the list 'cities', depending on the comparison of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in 'cities'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of length n - 1, where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between two consecutive elements in the list 'cities', depending on the comparison of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in 'cities'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
