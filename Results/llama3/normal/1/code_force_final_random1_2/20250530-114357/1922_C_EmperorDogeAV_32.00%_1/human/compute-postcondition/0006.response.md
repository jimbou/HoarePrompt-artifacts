Postcondition: **cities is a list of distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, n is at least 2, prog_cities is a list of zeros with length n - 1. The current value of i is less than n - 1. If i is greater than 0, back is a distinct non-negative integer in ascending order and forward is 99999999. Otherwise, i is 0**
