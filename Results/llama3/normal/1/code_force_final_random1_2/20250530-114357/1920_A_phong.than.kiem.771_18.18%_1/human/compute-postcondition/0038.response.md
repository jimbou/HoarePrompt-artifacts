The only object in the loop head is variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list. So for the loop to be executed, `num` must not be empty, which means `t` must be 3.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` and is not empty, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `count_num` is 0**
