You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) and then n lines each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` and has at least `n` elements, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `i` is the last element in the list. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, `count_num` is increased by 1.
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns the integer 0.
    #State: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` and has at least `n` elements, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `i` is the last element in the list. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, `count_num` is increased by 1. Additionally, `start` is less than or equal to `end`
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num`, where `end` is an integer, `start` is an integer and is less than or equal to `end`, and `count_num` is the number of elements in the list `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` inclusive, or 0 if `count_num` is greater than or equal to `end - start + 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the integer 0.

Case_2: The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num`, where `end` is an integer, `start` is an integer and is less than or equal to `end`, and `count_num` is the number of elements in the list `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` inclusive, or 0 if `count_num` is greater than or equal to `end - start + 1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
