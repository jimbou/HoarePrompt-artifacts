Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 0, `num` is a list containing the value of `v`, `stdin` contains n-2 lines each containing two integers a and x, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer and its current value is 3. If `t` was previously 2, then the value of `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` was previously 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` was set to `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been appended to the list `num`, which was initially empty. The number of lines in `stdin` has decreased by 1, as one line has been read to obtain the value of `v`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. The conditions related to `t`, `end`, `start`, and `v` also remain the same, as they were not affected by the code.
