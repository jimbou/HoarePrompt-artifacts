State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 0, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains n-3 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-2 lines, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer. If `t` is 2, then the value of `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` was 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` was set to `v`.**
