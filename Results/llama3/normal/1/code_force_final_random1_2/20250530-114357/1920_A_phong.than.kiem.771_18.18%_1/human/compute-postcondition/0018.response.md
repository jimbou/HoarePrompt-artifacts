Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 0, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains n-4 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-3 lines, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `start` is equal to `v`. If `t` is 2, then the value of `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `start` is updated to be equal to `v`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still between 2 and 100 inclusive and greater than 0. The list `num` still contains the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains empty. The number of lines in `stdin` is still n-4 if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-3. The value of `i` is still 1. The value of `t` is still equal to the first integer from the input, and the value of `v` is still equal to the second integer from the input. If `t` is 2, the value of `end` is either equal to `v` or remains 1000000000.0.
