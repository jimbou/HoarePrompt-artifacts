Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` and is not empty, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `count_num` is 0. The current value of `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end` and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement.
