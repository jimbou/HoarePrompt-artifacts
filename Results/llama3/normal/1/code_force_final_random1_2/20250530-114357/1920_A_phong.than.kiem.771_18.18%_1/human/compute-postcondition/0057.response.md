Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and returns the number of integers within a specified range that are not present in a given list of integers. The function first reads an integer n, followed by n lines of input, each containing two integers t and v. It uses this input to determine a range [start, end] and a list of integers num. The function then counts the number of integers in num that are within the range [start, end] and returns the difference between the total number of integers in the range and the count, or 0 if the count is greater than or equal to the total number of integers in the range. If the start of the range is greater than the end, the function returns 0.**
