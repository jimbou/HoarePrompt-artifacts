Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 0, `start` is equal to `v`, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains n-1 lines each containing two integers a and x, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer with a current value of 1, `v` is an integer and the value of `start` is less than the value of `v` is no longer valid since `start` is now equal to `v`**.

In this output state, the value of `start` has been updated to be equal to `v`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the value of `start` is less than the value of `v` is no longer valid since `start` is now equal to `v`.
