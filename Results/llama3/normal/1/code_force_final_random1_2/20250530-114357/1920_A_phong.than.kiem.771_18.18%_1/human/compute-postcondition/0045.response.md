Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` and has at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `i` is the second element in the list and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and moves on to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `num`, `stdin`, `t`, `v`, `start`, `end`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
