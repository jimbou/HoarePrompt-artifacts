Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` and is not empty, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `count_num` is 1. `i` is larger or equal to `start` and `i` is smaller or equal to `end`.**

In this output state, the value of `count_num` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0. The list `num` still contains the values of `v` and is not empty. The `stdin` still contains 0 lines. The value of `i` is still equal to `n`. The value of `t` is still an integer equal to 3. The value of `v` is still an integer equal to the last integer from the input. The values of `start` and `end` are still integers. The condition that `i` is larger or equal to `start` and `i` is smaller or equal to `end` is still valid.
