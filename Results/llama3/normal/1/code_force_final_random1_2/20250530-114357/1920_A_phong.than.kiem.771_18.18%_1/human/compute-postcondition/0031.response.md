Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 1, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains n-6 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-5 lines, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `end` is equal to `v`, If `t` is 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is not 1, then no changes are made to `start`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `end` is updated to be equal to `v`, which is the second integer from the input. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still between 2 and 100 inclusive and greater than 1. The list `num` still contains the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains empty. The `stdin` still contains n-6 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-5 lines. The value of `i` is still 2. The value of `t` is still the first integer from the input. The value of `v` is still the second integer from the input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is not 1, then no changes are made to `start`.
