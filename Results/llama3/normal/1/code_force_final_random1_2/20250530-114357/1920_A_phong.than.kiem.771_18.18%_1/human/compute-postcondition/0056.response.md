Output State: **The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1 minus `count_num`, where `end` is an integer, `start` is an integer and is less than or equal to `end`, and `count_num` is the number of elements in the list `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` inclusive, or 0 if `count_num` is greater than or equal to `end - start + 1`.**
