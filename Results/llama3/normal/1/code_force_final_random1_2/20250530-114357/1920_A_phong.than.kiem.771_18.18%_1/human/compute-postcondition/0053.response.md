Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` and has at least `n` elements, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `i` is the last element in the list. The current value of `start` is greater than the current value of `end`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, `count_num` is increased by 1.***
