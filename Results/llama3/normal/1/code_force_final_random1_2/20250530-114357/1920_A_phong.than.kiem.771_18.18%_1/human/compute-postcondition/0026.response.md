The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 1, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains n-5 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-4 lines, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`.**
