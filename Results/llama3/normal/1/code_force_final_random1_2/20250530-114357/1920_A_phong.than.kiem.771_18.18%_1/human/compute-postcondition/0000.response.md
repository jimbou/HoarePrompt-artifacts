Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, start is -1, end is 1000000000.0, num is an empty list, stdin contains n lines each containing two integers a and x.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is between 2 and 100 inclusive, `n` becomes an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. The second line assigns -1 to `start`. The third line assigns 1000000000.0 to `end`. The fourth line assigns an empty list to `num`. No other variables are affected.
