Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 0, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains n-4 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-3 lines, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `end` is equal to `v`, If `t` is 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `end` has been updated to be equal to `v`, which is the second integer from the input. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `start` is still dependent on the value of `t` and `v`, as specified in the initial state.
