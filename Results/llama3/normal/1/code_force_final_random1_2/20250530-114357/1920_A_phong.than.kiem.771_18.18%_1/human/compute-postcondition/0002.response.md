Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains n-1 lines each containing two integers a and x, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `n` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the values of `start`, `end`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and it must be greater than 0. The `stdin` now contains `n-1` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `x`, because one line has been read and processed. The variables `t` and `v` are assigned the values of the two integers read from the input, which are now integers due to the `map(int, ...)` function.
