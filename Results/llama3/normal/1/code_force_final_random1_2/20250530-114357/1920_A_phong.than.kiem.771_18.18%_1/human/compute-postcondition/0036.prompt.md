Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, start is -1, end is 1000000000.0, num is an empty list, stdin contains n lines each containing two integers a and x.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if t == 1:
        if start < v:
            start = v
    if t == 2:
        if end > v:
            end = v
    if t == 3:
        num.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 0, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains n-2 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-1 lines, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer. If `t` is 2, then the value of `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` was 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` was set to `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 0, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains n-5 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-4 lines, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 1, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains n-6 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is not 3, otherwise it contains n-7 lines, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is not 1, then no changes are made to `start`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`. If `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`. If `t` is not 2, then no changes are made to `end`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
