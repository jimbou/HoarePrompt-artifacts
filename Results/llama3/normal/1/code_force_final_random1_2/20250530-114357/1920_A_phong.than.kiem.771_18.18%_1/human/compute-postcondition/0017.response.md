Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 0, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains n-4 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-3 lines, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If `t` is 2, then the value of `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` was 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` was set to `v`.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `v` have been updated to the integers from the input. The number of lines in `stdin` has decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
