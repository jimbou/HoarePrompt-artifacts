Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables have been updated accordingly. The value of `n` is now 0, indicating that the loop has completed. The list `num` contains all the values of `v` that were input when `t` was 3. The input stream `stdin` is now empty, as all the input lines have been processed. The variable `i` is equal to the initial value of `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The variables `t` and `v` hold the values of the last input integers. The variables `start` and `end` have been updated according to the input values, with `start` being set to the maximum value of `v` when `t` is 1, and `end` being set to the minimum value of `v` when `t` is 2.
