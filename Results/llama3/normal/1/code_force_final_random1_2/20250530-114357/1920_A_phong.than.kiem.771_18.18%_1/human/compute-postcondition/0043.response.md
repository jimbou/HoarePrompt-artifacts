Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` and is not empty, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, then we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, `i` is larger or equal to `start` and `i` is smaller or equal to `end`, and `count_num` is 1.***
