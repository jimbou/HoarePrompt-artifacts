Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` and has at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `i` is the second element in the list, `count_num` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count_num` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still between 2 and 100 inclusive and is equal to 0. The list `num` still contains the values of `v` and has at least 2 elements. The `stdin` still contains 0 lines. The value of `t` is still 3. The value of `v` is still the last integer from the input. The values of `start` and `end` are still integers. The value of `i` is still the second element in the list.
