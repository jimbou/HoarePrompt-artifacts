Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 1, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains n-7 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-6 lines, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is not 1, then no changes are made to `start`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`. If `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`. If `t` is not 2, then no changes are made to `end`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `n` remains the same, between 2 and 100 inclusive, and greater than 1. The list `num` now contains the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list. The number of lines in `stdin` has decreased by 1, so it now contains n-7 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-6 lines. The value of `i` remains 2. The values of `t` and `v` remain the same, equal to the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The values of `start` and `end` have been updated based on the value of `t`. If `t` is 1, `start` is set to `v` if it was less than `v`. If `t` is 2, `end` is set to `v` if it is greater than `v`.
