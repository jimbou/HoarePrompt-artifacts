Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`, and `count_num` is 0.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `count_num` and initialized it to 0. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions related to `t`, `start`, and `end` are still applicable, and the list `num` still contains the values of `v` if `t` is 3. The input from `stdin` is still empty, and the values of `n`, `i`, `t`, and `v` are unchanged.
