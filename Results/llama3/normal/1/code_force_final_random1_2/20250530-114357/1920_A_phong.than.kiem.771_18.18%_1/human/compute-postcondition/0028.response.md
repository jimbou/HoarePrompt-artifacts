Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 1, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains n-6 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-5 lines, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `start` is equal to `v`, If `t` is 2, then `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `start` is updated to be equal to `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still between 2 and 100 inclusive and greater than 1. The list `num` still contains the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains empty. The number of lines in `stdin` is still `n-6` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains `n-5`. The value of `i` is still 2. The value of `t` is still the first integer from the input, and the value of `v` is still the second integer from the input. If `t` is 2, the value of `end` is either equal to `v` or remains 1000000000.0, and if `end` is greater than `v`, it is set to `v`.
