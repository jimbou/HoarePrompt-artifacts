Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 1, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains n-6 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-5 lines, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, and the conditions related to `start` and `end` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `t` is now equal to the first integer from the input, and the value of `v` is equal to the second integer from the input. The list `num` contains the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list. The number of lines in `stdin` has decreased by 1, and the remaining lines contain two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise they remain the same.
