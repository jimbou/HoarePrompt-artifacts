Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is greater than 1, `num` is a list containing the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains n-6 lines each containing two integers a and x if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains n-5 lines, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input. If `start` was less than `v`, then `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`.***
