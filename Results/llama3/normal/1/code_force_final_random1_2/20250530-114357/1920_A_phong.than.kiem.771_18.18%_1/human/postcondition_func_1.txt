This function reads a line of input from the user, splits it into items based on a specified separator (either spaces or individual characters), and returns the items as a list. The list can contain either integers or strings/characters, depending on the value of the `to_int` parameter. If `to_int` is True, the function converts the items to integers before returning them. If `to_int` is False, the function returns the items as strings or characters. The function's output is determined by the values of the `space` and `to_int` parameters, which control how the input is split and what type of data is returned.
