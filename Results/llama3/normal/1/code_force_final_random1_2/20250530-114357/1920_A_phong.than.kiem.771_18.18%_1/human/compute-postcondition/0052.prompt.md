Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise it remains an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input. If `t` is 1, then if `start` was less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is either equal to the value of `v` or remains 1000000000.0. If `t` is 2 and `end` is greater than `v`, then `end` is set to `v`, and `count_num` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in num:
    if i < start or i > end:
        continue
    else:
        count_num += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` and is not empty, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, then we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, `i` is larger or equal to `start` and `i` is smaller or equal to `end`, and `count_num` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` and has at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `i` is the second element in the list. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the program skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, `count_num` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` and has at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `i` is the third element in the list. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `count_num` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
