According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is not empty, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `num` must have at least 2 elements and `i` is the second element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` and has at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `i` is the second element in the list**
