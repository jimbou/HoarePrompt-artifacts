Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and is equal to 0, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` and has at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `t` is an integer equal to 3, `v` is an integer equal to the last integer from the input, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `i` is the third element in the list and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we continue to the next iteration of the loop. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
