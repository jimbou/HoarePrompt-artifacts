Postcondition: ***`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference minus 1, then `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus half of the difference and `tmp` is a list containing half of the difference. In all other cases, `ans` is `x + y - 2` and `tmp` is an empty list.***
