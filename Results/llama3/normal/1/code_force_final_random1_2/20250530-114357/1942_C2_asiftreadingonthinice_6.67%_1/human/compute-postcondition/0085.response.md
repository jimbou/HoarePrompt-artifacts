Output State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` plus the sum of all the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to 2, plus the sum of half of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even and for which `y` is greater than half of the difference minus 1, plus 1, `tmp` is a list containing half of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even and for which `y` is greater than half of the difference minus 1, `y` is decreased by the sum of half of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even and for which `y` is greater than half of the difference minus 1 minus the number of such differences.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
