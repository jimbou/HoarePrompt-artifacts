Output State: **tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, i is equal to the length of a, ans is x + 2y plus the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are equal to 2, plus the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and greater than twice y plus 1, plus 1 if the difference between the first element of a and the last element of a plus n is equal to 2, otherwise ans is x + 2y plus the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are equal to 2, plus the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and greater than twice y plus 1, plus half of the difference between the ith element of a and the (i-1)th element of a if the difference between the first element of a, n, and the last element of a is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the ith element of a and the (i-1)th element of a minus 1, otherwise ans remains the same, tmp is a list containing half of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and greater than twice y plus 1, plus half of the difference between the first element of a, n, and the last element of a if the difference between the first element of a, n, and the last element of a is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the ith element of a and the (i-1)th element of a minus 1, otherwise tmp remains the same.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been increased by `y`. The value of `ans` now depends on the same conditions as before, but with `y` added to the sum. The other variables remain unchanged.
