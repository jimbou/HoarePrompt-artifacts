Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (x) is equal to the number of sides of the polygon (n). In this case, the program will output a negative number, which is incorrect.

For example, if the input is:

3
4 4 0
1 2 3 4

The program will output -1, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 0, because there are no more vertices to choose and no more triangles can be formed.

This is because the program does not handle the case where x is equal to n correctly. It assumes that there will always be more vertices to choose, which is not the case when x is equal to n.
