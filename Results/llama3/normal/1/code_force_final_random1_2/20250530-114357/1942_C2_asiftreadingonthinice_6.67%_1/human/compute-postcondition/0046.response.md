Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 2. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `y` is updated to its original value minus half of the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` minus 1, `tmp` is a list containing half of the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]`, and `ans` is updated to its original value plus half of the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
