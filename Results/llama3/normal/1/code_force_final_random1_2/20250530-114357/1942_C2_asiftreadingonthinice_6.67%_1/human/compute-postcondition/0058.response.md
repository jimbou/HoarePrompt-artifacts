Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference between the last two elements of `a` minus 1, then `ans` is increased by half of the difference between the last two elements of `a` and `tmp` is extended by the integer division of the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` by 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
