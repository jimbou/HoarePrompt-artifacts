The only variables in the loop head are variables  ii and tt, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable tt. If tt is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to tt is greater than 0 and ii is now 0. 
State: **`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0**
