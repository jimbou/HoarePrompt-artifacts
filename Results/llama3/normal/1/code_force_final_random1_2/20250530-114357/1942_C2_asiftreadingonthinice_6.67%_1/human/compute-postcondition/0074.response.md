Output State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1, `stdin` is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `tt`, `ii`, `i` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is increased by 1. The stdin remains empty.
