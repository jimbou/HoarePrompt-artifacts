Output State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is an integer increased by 1, `tmp` is a list**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is unknown, so the output state is: `ans` is an integer increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
