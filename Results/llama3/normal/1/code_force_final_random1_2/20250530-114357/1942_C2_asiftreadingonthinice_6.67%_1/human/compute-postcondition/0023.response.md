Output State: **tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, i is equal to the length of a, ans is x + y plus the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are equal to 2, plus the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and greater than twice y plus 1, plus 1, tmp is a list containing half of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and greater than twice y plus 1. The current value of n is such that the difference between the first element of a and the last element of a plus n is equal to 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: all variables keep their initial values except for `ans` which is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` now includes the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to 2, plus the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even and greater than twice `y` plus 1, plus 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
