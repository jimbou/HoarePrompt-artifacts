Functionality: This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the list consecutive, considering the constraints x and y, and prints the result for each test case. The function takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints the results directly to standard output.
