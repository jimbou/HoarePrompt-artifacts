Postcondition: ***`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is even and greater than twice `y` plus 1, then `y` is decreased by half of the difference between the third and second elements of `a` minus 1, `tmp` has one more element which is half of the difference between the third and second elements of `a`, and `ans` is increased by half of the difference between the third and second elements of `a`.***
