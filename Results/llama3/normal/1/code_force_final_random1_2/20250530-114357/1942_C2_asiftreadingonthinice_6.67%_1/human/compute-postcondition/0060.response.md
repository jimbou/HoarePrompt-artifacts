Output State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is equal to 2, then `ans` is increased by 1 plus `y`. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference between the last two elements of `a` minus 1, then `ans` is increased by half of the difference between the last two elements of `a` plus `y` and `tmp` is extended by the integer division of the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` by 2. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `y`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been increased by the value of `y`. The conditions that determine the value of `ans` are still the same, but the increase in `ans` now includes the value of `y`.
