Postcondition: ***n, x, y are integers, a is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, stdin is empty, tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, i is 3. If (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, then y is updated to its original value minus ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1), tmp is a list with one element equal to (a[3] - a[2]) // 2, and ans is an integer equal to its original value plus (a[3] - a[2]) // 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
