Postcondition: **`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is either `x + y`, `x + y - 1` plus half of the difference, or `x + y - 1`, and `tmp` is either a list containing half of the difference or an empty list. Otherwise, `ans` is either `x + y - 1`, `x + y - 2` plus half of the difference, or `x + y - 2`, and `tmp` is either a list containing half of the difference or an empty list. If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is decreased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `tmp` is a list containing half of the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]`.**
