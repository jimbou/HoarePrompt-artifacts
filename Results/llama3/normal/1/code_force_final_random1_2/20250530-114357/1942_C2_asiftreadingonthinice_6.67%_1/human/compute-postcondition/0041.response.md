Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 1. If the difference between the `i-th` element of `a` and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` is 2, then `ans` is `x` + `y` - 1. If the difference between the `i-th` element of `a` and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` is not equal to 2, then if the difference is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference minus 1, `y` is decreased by ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2) - 1, `ans` is increased by ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2), and `tmp` contains ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2). Otherwise, the values of `y`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.**
