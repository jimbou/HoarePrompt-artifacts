Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, ans is x + y - 2, tmp is an empty list, tt is greater than 1, ii is 1, i is equal to the length of a
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 1. If the difference between the `i-th` element of `a` and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` is 2, then `ans` is `x` + `y` - 1. If the difference between the `i-th` element of `a` and the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` is not equal to 2, then if the difference is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference minus 1, `y` is decreased by ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2) - 1, `ans` is increased by ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2), and `tmp` contains ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2). Otherwise, the values of `y`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 2. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `y` is updated to its original value minus half of the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` minus 1, `tmp` is a list containing half of the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]`, and `ans` is updated to its original value plus half of the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]`. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 3. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, then if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2` equals 0 and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to its original value minus `((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` is a list with one element equal to `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
