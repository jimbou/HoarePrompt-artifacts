Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is x + y - 2, tmp is an empty list, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference minus 1, then `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus half of the difference and `tmp` is a list containing half of the difference. In all other cases, `ans` is `x + y - 2` and `tmp` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is either `x + y`, `x + y - 1` plus half of the difference, or `x + y - 1`, and `tmp` is either a list containing half of the difference or an empty list. Otherwise, `ans` is either `x + y - 1`, `x + y - 2` plus half of the difference, or `x + y - 2`, and `tmp` is either a list containing half of the difference or an empty list. If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is decreased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `tmp` is a list containing half of the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is not 2, then if the difference is even and greater than twice `y` plus 1, `y` is decreased by half of the difference between the third and second elements of `a` minus 1, `tmp` has one more element which is half of the difference between the third and second elements of `a`, and `ans` is increased by half of the difference between the third and second elements of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
