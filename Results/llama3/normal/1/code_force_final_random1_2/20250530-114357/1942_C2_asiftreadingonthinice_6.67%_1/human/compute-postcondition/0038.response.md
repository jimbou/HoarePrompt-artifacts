Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty, the current value of `ans` is `x` + `y` - 2, `tmp` is an empty list, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 1, the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in list `a` is not equal to 2, the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in list `a` is even, and `y` is greater than half of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in list `a` minus 1.***
