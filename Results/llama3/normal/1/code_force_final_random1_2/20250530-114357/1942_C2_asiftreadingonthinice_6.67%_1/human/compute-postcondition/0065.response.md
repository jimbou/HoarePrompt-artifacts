To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(a)` is greater than 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `len(a)`. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, which means it's already at the end of the range. To ensure the loop executes, `i` should be adjusted to be within the range, and `a` should have at least 2 elements.

State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list**
