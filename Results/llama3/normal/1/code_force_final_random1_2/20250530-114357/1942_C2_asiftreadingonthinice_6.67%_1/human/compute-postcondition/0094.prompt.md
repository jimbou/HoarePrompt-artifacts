Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]
        ) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, i is equal to the length of a, ans is x + 2y plus the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are equal to 2, plus the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and greater than twice y plus 1, plus 1 if the difference between the first element of a and the last element of a plus n is equal to 2, otherwise ans is x + 2y plus the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are equal to 2, plus the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and greater than twice y plus 1, plus half of the difference between the ith element of a and the (i-1)th element of a if the difference between the first element of a, n, and the last element of a is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the ith element of a and the (i-1)th element of a minus 1, otherwise ans remains the same, tmp is a list containing half of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and greater than twice y plus 1, plus half of the difference between the first element of a, n, and the last element of a if the difference between the first element of a, n, and the last element of a is even and y is greater than half of the difference between the ith element of a and the (i-1)th element of a minus 1, otherwise tmp remains the same, and the minimum value between ans and n-2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is equal to 2, then `ans` is increased by 1 plus `y`. If the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference between the last two elements of `a` minus 1, then `ans` is increased by half of the difference between the last two elements of `a` plus `y` and `tmp` is extended by the integer division of the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` by 2. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `y`. The minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n, x, y are integers, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, tt is greater than 2, ii is 2, i is equal to the length of a, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the sum of all the differences between consecutive elements in a that are equal to 2, plus the sum of half of the differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and for which y is greater than half of the difference minus 1, plus y. If the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a is equal to 2, then ans is increased by 1. If the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a is even and y is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then y is decreased by half of this difference minus 1, ans is increased by half of this difference, and tmp is appended with half of this difference. Otherwise, the values of y, ans, and tmp remain unchanged, and the minimum value between ans and n-2 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
