Postcondition: **n, x, y are integers, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, tt is greater than 2, ii is 2, i is equal to the length of a, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the sum of all the differences between consecutive elements in a that are equal to 2, plus the sum of half of the differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and for which y is greater than half of the difference minus 1, tmp is a list containing half of the differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and for which y is greater than half of the difference minus 1, y is decreased by the sum of half of the differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and for which y is greater than half of the difference minus 1 minus the number of such differences. The current value of n, x, y, a, stdin, tt, ii, i, ans, tmp, and y are the same as in the precondition. Additionally, the difference between the first element of a and the last element of a, minus n, is equal to 2.**
