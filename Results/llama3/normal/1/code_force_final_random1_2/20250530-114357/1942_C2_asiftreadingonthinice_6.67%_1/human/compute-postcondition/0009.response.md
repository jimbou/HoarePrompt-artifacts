Postcondition: ***`tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `tmp` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is 1.***
