Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list. The difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is even and the current value of `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1. Additionally, the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is not equal to 2***
