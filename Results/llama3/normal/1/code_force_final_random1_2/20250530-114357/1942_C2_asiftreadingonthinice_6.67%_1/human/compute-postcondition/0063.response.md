The only variable in the loop head is `ii` and `tt`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ii` and `tt`. If `ii` is less than `tt`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 1, `tt` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `ii` must be increased by 1, so `ii` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `tt` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`**
