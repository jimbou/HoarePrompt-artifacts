Output: **n, x, y are integers, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, tt is greater than 2, ii is 2, i is equal to the length of a, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2 plus the sum of all the differences between consecutive elements in a that are equal to 2, plus the sum of half of the differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and for which y is greater than half of the difference minus 1, plus y. If the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a is equal to 2, then ans is increased by 1. If the difference between the first element of a, n and the last element of a is even and y is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then y is decreased by half of this difference minus 1, ans is increased by half of this difference, and tmp is appended with half of this difference. Otherwise, the values of y, ans, and tmp remain unchanged, and the minimum value between ans and n-2 is printed.**
