Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 3, `stdin` is empty. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `y` is decreased by half of the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` plus 1, `ans` is increased by half of the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]`, and `tmp` is extended by half of the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
