Output State: **tt is greater than 0, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer minus half of the difference between the ith element of a and the (i-1)th element of a minus 1, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, i is equal to the length of a, the current value of ans is x + y plus the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are equal to 2, plus the sum of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and greater than twice y plus 1, plus half of the difference between the ith element of a and the (i-1)th element of a, the current value of tmp is a list containing half of all differences between consecutive elements in a that are even and greater than twice y plus 1, plus half of the difference between the first element of a, n, and the last element of a.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `tt` remains greater than 0, and `ii` is still 0. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are unchanged, except for `y`, which is now decreased by half of the difference between the ith element of `a` and the (i-1)th element of `a`, minus 1. The list `a` remains sorted, and `stdin` is still empty. The value of `i` is still equal to the length of `a`. The value of `ans` has increased by half of the difference between the ith element of `a` and the (i-1)th element of `a`. The list `tmp` now includes half of the difference between the first element of `a`, `n`, and the last element of `a`, in addition to its previous contents.
