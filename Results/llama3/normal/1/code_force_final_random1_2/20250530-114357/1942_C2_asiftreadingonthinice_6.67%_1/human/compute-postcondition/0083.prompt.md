Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, x, y are integers, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin is empty, tt is greater than 2, ii is 2, i is equal to the length of a, ans is an integer equal to x + y - 2, tmp is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 1. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in list `a` is 2, then `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 1`. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `ans` is an integer equal to `x + y - 2` plus half of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a`, and `tmp` is a list containing half of the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `a`. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `tmp` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 2. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is decreased by `((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` is a list with one additional element `((a[2] - a[1]) // 2)`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `stdin`, `tt`, `ii`, `i` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is 3, `stdin` is empty. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is even and `y` is greater than half of this difference minus 1, then `y` is decreased by half of the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` plus 1, `ans` is increased by half of the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]`, and `tmp` is extended by half of the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]`. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
