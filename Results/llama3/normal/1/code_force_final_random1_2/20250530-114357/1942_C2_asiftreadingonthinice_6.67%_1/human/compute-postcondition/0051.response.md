Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is 3. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, then if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2` equals 0 and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to its original value minus `((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` is a list with one element equal to `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `ans` is an integer equal to its original value plus `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
