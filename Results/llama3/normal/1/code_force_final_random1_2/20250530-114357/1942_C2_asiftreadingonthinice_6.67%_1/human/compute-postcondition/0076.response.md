Postcondition: ***n, x, y are integers, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, stdin is empty, tt is greater than 2, ii is 2, i is 2. If (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1, then y is decreased by ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1), tmp is a list with one additional element ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2), ans is increased by (a[2] - a[1]) // 2. Otherwise, the values of n, x, y, a, stdin, tt, ii, i remain unchanged.***
