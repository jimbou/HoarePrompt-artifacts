Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is an integer and is increased by 1, `tmp` is a list of integers. The current value of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is equal to 2**

The value of `ans` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The condition `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is equal to 2 is still valid.
