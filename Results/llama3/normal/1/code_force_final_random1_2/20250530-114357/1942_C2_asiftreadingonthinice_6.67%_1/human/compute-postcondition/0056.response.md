Postcondition: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` is empty, `tt` is greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is an integer, `tmp` is a list of integers. The difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is not equal to 2. The current value of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even. The current value of `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.**
