To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):`

The objects in the loop head are:

* `_` (the loop variable)
* `sys.stdin.readline()` (the input function)
* `int()` (the conversion function)
* `range()` (the range function)

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input from `sys.stdin.readline()`. Since the loop has already executed once, we know that `sys.stdin.readline()` has returned a value greater than 0.

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the states as follows:

* `_` should be incremented by 1, since it is the loop variable.
* `sys.stdin.readline()` should still return a value greater than 0, since the loop will only execute if there is input.
* `int()` and `range()` are functions and do not have state, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`_` is 1, `sys.stdin.readline()` is greater than 0, and the function `solve()` has been executed.**

Note that the state of `solve()` is not changed, since it is not an object in the loop head.
