The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `sys.stdin.readline()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sys.stdin.readline()`. If `sys.stdin.readline()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple sets of inputs, each set consists of a line with two integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines, each containing two integers v and u, does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `sys.stdin.readline()` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple sets of inputs, each set consists of a line with two integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines, each containing two integers v and u, `_` is 0, `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than 0**
