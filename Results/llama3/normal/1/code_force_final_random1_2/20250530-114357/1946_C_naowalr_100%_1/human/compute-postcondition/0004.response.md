To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):`. The objects involved are `_` and `sys.stdin.readline()`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value returned by `int(sys.stdin.readline())` is greater than the current value of `_`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `sys.stdin.readline()` is greater than 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `_` by 1, so `_` becomes 2. Additionally, `sys.stdin.readline()` must still be greater than 0, but since it's already greater than 0, we don't need to change its state.

The state of the function `solve()` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **The function `solve()` has been executed twice, `_` is 2, and `sys.stdin.readline()` is greater than 0.**
