#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple sets of inputs, each set consists of a line with two integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines, each containing two integers v and u.
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: The function `solve()` has been executed `n` times, `_` is `n-1`, and `sys.stdin.readline()` is 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple sets of inputs from standard input, where each set consists of a line with two integers n and k, followed by n-1 lines, each containing two integers v and u, and performs some operation on each set of inputs, repeating this process until all sets have been processed.
