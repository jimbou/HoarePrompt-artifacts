The `print(math.ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2.

Since `k` is equal to the second integer in the string `s`, we can't determine the exact value of `k` without knowing the contents of `s`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `k`.

The `math.ceil` function returns the smallest integer not less than the given number. So, the output will be the smallest integer not less than the result of dividing `k` by 2.

Output: **the ceiling of k divided by 2 (where k is the second integer in the string s)**
