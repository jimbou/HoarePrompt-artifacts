Output: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is no longer valid, and the current value of `k` is equal to 4 times `n` minus 3, which is larger than 4 * `n` - 4, and the value of 2 * `n` - 1 is being printed**
