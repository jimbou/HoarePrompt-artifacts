Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `n` is equal to the first integer in the string `s`, `k` is equal to the second integer in the string `s`, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a string that represents the third line of the input.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the first and second integers in the string `s`, respectively. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
