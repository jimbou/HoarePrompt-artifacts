Based on the precondition, we know that `n` and `k` are integers, and `k` is equal to 4 * `n` - 2. We also know that `k` is larger than 4 * `n` - 4 and not equal to 4 * `n` - 3.

The print statement is `print(2 * n)`. To determine what will be printed, we need to find the value of `n`.

Since `k` is equal to 4 * `n` - 2, we can rearrange the equation to solve for `n`:

`k` = 4 * `n` - 2
`k` + 2 = 4 * `n`
(`k` + 2) / 4 = `n`

We know that `k` is larger than 4 * `n` - 4, so `k` + 2 is larger than 4 * `n` - 2. Therefore, (`k` + 2) / 4 is larger than `n` - 1/2.

We also know that `k` is not equal to 4 * `n` - 3, so `k` + 2 is not equal to 4 * `n` - 1. Therefore, (`k` + 2) / 4 is not equal to `n` - 1/4.

Since `n` is an integer, the only possible value for `n` is the smallest integer that satisfies the inequalities:

`n` > (`k` + 2) / 4 - 1/2
`n` â‰  (`k` + 2) / 4 - 1/4

The smallest integer that satisfies these inequalities is `n` = (`k` + 2) / 4.

Therefore, the print statement will print:

Output: **2 * ((k + 2) / 4)**
