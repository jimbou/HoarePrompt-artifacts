The code prints the value of `2 * n`, where `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the string `s`. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `2 * n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output twice the value of the first integer in the string `s`.

Output: **twice the value of the first integer in the string s**
