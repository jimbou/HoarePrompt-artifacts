#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000). Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2).
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)
        
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers, `n` is equal to the first integer in the string `s`, `k` is equal to the second integer in the string `s`, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a string that represents the last line of the input. If `k` is less than or equal to 4 times `n` minus 4, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 3, then 2 times `n` minus 1 is printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 2, then the value of 2 times `n` is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and each subsequent line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2). It then prints the result of a calculation based on the values of n and k. If k is less than or equal to 4n - 4, it prints the ceiling of k divided by 2. If k equals 4n - 3, it prints 2n - 1. If k equals 4n - 2, it prints 2n. The function repeats this process for each line of input, effectively processing a series of test cases.
