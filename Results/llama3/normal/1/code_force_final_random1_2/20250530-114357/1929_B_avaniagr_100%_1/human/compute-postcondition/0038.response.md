Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `n` is equal to the first integer in the string `s`, `k` is equal to the second integer in the string `s`, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a string that represents the last line of the input. If `k` is less than or equal to 4 times `n` minus 4, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 3, then 2 times `n` minus 1 is printed. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 2, then the value of 2 times `n` is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the last line of the input, and the loop prints the corresponding value based on the conditions. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as `t` and the input lines, remains unchanged.
