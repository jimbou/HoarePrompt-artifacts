Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is no longer valid**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are determined by the second line of input, which is split into two integers using the `split()` method. The first integer is assigned to `n` and the second integer is assigned to `k`. The value of `s` is no longer valid as it has been used to assign values to `n` and `k`. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, with the first line containing a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000).
