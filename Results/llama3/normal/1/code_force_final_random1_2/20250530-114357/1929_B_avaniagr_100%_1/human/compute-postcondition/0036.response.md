Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `n` is equal to the first integer in the string `s`, `k` is equal to the second integer in the string `s`, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a string that represents the third line of the input. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 3, then 2 * n - 1 is printed, where n is the first integer in the string `s`. If `k` equals 4 times `n` minus 2, then the value of 2 times `n` is being printed.***
