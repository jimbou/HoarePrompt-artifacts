Functionality: **The function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and each subsequent line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2). It then prints the result of a calculation based on the values of n and k. If k is less than or equal to 4n - 4, it prints the ceiling of k divided by 2. If k equals 4n - 3, it prints 2n - 1. If k equals 4n - 2, it prints 2n. The function repeats this process for each line of input, effectively processing a series of test cases.**
