Based on the precondition, the value of `n` is equal to the first integer in the string `s`, and the value of `k` is equal to the second integer in the string `s`. However, the print statement `print(2 * n - 1)` does not depend on the value of `k`. It only depends on the value of `n`.

Since the value of `n` is equal to the first integer in the string `s`, the print statement will print the value of 2 times the first integer in the string `s` minus 1.

Output: **2 times the first integer in the string s minus 1**
