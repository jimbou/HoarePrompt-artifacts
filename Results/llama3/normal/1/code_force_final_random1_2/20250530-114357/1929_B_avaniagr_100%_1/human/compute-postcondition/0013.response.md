Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is no longer valid, and `k` is larger than 4 * `n` - 4 and `k` is not equal to 4 * `n` - 3. If `k` is equal to 4 * `n` - 2, the value of 2 times `n` is being printed.***
