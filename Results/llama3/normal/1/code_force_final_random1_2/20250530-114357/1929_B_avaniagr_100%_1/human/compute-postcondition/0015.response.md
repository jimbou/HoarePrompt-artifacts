Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is no longer valid. If `k` is less than or equal to 4 times the value of `n` minus 4, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is being printed. If `k` is equal to 4 * `n` - 3, the value of 2 * `n` - 1 is being printed. If `k` is equal to 4 * `n` - 2, the value of 2 times `n` is being printed. For all other values of `k` larger than 4 * `n` - 4, no value is being printed.***
