The code prints the result of the expression `2 * n - 1`, where `n` is the first integer in the string `s`.

Since `n` is equal to the first integer in the string `s`, we can't determine its exact value without knowing the contents of `s`. However, we can describe its value using the given information.

Output: **2 * (the first integer in the string s) - 1**
