Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n to have at least k diagonals with at least one colored cell.

The program handles three cases:

1. If k is less than or equal to 4n - 4, it prints the ceiling of k divided by 2. This is because in this case, we can color cells in a way that each diagonal has at most two colored cells, so we need at least k/2 cells.

2. If k equals 4n - 3, it prints 2n - 1. This is because in this case, we need to color all cells in one row or column, and one more cell in the other row or column.

3. If k equals 4n - 2, it prints 2n. This is because in this case, we need to color all cells in two rows or columns.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored.

Correctness: **True**
