The only variable in the loop head is variable  s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string that represents the second line of the input. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `s` must be a string that represents the third line of the input.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `n` is equal to the first integer in the string `s`, `k` is equal to the second integer in the string `s`, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a string that represents the third line of the input.**
