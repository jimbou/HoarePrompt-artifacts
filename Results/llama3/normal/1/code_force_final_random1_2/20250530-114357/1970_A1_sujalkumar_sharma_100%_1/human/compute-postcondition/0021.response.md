Functionality: **Reorders a balanced parentheses sequence to a specific order.**

The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and returns a string consisting of the same characters in a specific order, maintaining the balanced parentheses sequence. The function reorders the characters based on their balance and position in the original string, resulting in a new string with the same characters in a different order.
