Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `prefix_balance` is a list containing `n` tuples ((0, 0, "(") or (0, 0, ")") and (new_balance, i, s[i])), `i` is `n-1`, `balance` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence. The length of `s` is still `n`. The `prefix_balance` list now contains `n` tuples, where each tuple represents the balance of the parentheses sequence up to a certain index `i`. The `i` variable has reached `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated over the entire string. Finally, the `balance` variable has returned to 0, indicating that the parentheses sequence is balanced.
