Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple ((0, 0, "(") or (0, 0, ")")), `balance` is -1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is ")"**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been updated to -1, as it was decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The string `s` is still a balanced parentheses sequence, and the character at index `i` is still ")". The value of `n` is still at least 1, and the `prefix_balance` list still contains one tuple.
