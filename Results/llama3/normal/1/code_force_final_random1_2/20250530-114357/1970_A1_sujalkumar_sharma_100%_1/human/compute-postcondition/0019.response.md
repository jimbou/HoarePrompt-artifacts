Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, prefix_balance is a sorted list containing n tuples ((new_balance, i, s[i])), result is a string consisting of the characters of s in a specific order, i is n-1, balance is 0.**

The code snippet sorts the prefix_balance list in ascending order based on the new_balance value and then in descending order based on the index i. After sorting, the result variable is assigned a string that consists of the characters of s in the order specified by the sorted prefix_balance list. The value of s, n, i, and balance remains unchanged.
