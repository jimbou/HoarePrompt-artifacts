Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balance` is a list containing one tuple ((0, 0, "(") or (0, 0, ")")), `balance` is 0, `i` is 0**

The code appends a tuple to the `prefix_balance` list. The tuple contains the current balance (0), the current index (0), and the character at the current index in the string `s`. Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the first character is either "(" or ")". Therefore, the tuple appended to `prefix_balance` is either (0, 0, "(") or (0, 0, ")"). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
