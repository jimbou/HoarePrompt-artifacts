Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, prefix_balance is an empty list, balance is 0**

The code initializes three new variables: `n`, `prefix_balance`, and `balance`. The first line assigns the length of the string `s` to `n`. The second line creates an empty list and assigns it to `prefix_balance`. The third line initializes `balance` to 0. The initial state of `s` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it.
