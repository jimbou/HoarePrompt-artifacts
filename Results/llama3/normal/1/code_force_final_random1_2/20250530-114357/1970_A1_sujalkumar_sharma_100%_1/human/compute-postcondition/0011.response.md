Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balance` is a list containing at least two tuples ((0, 0, "(") or (0, 0, ")") and (balance-1, i, s[i])), `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is "(", then `balance` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is ")", then `balance` is -2.**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence and `n` is at least 1 still holds. The `prefix_balance` list still contains at least two tuples, but the second tuple now has a balance value that is one less than its previous value. The value of `i` remains 1.
