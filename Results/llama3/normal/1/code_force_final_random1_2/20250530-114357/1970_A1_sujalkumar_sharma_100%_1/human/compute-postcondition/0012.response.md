Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balance` is a list containing at least two tuples ((0, 0, "(") or (0, 0, ")") and (new_balance, i, s[i])), `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is "(", then `new_balance` is `balance + 1`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is ")", then `new_balance` is `balance - 1`.***
