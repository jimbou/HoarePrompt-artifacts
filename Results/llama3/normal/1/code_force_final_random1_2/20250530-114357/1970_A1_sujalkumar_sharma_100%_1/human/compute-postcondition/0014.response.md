Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is at least 2, `prefix_balance` is a list containing at least three tuples ((0, 0, "(") or (0, 0, ")") and (new_balance, i, s[i]) and (balance, i, s[i])), `i` is 2, `balance` is the balance of the parentheses sequence up to index `i`**.

In this output state, the value of `balance` is the balance of the parentheses sequence up to index `i`, which is 2. The list `prefix_balance` now contains at least three tuples, including the newly appended tuple `(balance, i, s[i])`. The values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged.
