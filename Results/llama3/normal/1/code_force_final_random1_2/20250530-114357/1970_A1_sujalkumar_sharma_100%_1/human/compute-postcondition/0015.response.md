Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is at least 2, `prefix_balance` is a list containing at least three tuples ((0, 0, "(") or (0, 0, ")") and (new_balance, i, s[i]) and (balance, i, s[i])), `i` is 2, `balance` is the balance of the parentheses sequence up to index `i` plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `s` remains the same, the value of `n` is still at least 2, the list `prefix_balance` remains unchanged, the index `i` is still 2, and the balance of the parentheses sequence up to index `i` has increased by 1.
