Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balance` is a list containing at least two tuples ((0, 0, "(") or (0, 0, ")") and (balance + 1, i, s[i])), `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is "(", then `balance` is 2. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is ")", then `balance` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `prefix_balance` list still contains at least two tuples, but the second tuple now has an updated `balance` value, which is either 2 if the character at index `i` is "(" or 0 if the character at index `i` is ")".
