Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is at least 2, `prefix_balance` is a list containing at least three tuples ((0, 0, "(") or (0, 0, ")") and (new_balance, i, s[i]) and (balance, i, s[i])), `i` is 2, `balance` is the balance of the parentheses sequence up to index `i` minus 1**

The value of `balance` is decremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` is still a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is still at least 2, and `prefix_balance` still contains at least three tuples. The value of `i` is still 2. The balance of the parentheses sequence up to index `i` is now `balance - 1`.
