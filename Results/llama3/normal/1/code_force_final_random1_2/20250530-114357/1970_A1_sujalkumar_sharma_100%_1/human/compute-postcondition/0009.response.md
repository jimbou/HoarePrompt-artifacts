Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balance` is a list containing at least two tuples ((0, 0, "(") or (0, 0, ")") and (balance, i, s[i])), `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is "(", then `balance` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is ")", then `balance` is -1.**

In this output state, the list `prefix_balance` has been updated to include a new tuple containing the current balance, index `i`, and the character at index `i` in string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
