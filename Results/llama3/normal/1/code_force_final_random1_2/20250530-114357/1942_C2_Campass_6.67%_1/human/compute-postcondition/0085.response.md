Postcondition: **t is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than x, stdin contains t - x - 1 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 1, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is an empty list, i is the last element of val, sx is 0, the current value of c is 1, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is printed, i is 1**
