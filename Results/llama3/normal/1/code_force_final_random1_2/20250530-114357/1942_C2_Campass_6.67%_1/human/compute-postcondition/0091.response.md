Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than x, stdin contains t - x - 1 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 2, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing one element which is l[1] - l[0] - 1, i is 2, sx is 1, c is l[2] - l[1] - 1, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is printed, If c is 1, sx is 1 and the current value of c is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of sx has been incremented by 1, so sx is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of t is still greater than 0 and is x less than its original value, and the original value of t must be greater than x. The stdin still contains t - x - 1 inputs, each input being a test case consisting of two lines. The values of n, x, y, l, val, i, c, and cons remain the same as before.
