Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is `x` less than its original value, stdin contains `t - x` inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, `n` is an integer, `x` is at least 1, `y` is `y - c`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n + the first element of the list appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing `x - 1` elements, where even numbers come first, then odd numbers, `i` is either even or odd, `sx` is `sx + i`, `c` is `i // 2`, and `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated to be equal to `i // 2`, which means it is now half of the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `x`, `n`, `y`, `l`, `val`, `i`, `sx`, and `cons` are still valid.
