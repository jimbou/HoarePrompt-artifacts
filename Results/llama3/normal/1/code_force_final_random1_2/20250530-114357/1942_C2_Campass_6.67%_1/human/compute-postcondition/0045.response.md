Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value, `stdin` contains `t - 2` inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, `n` is an integer, `x` is at least 1, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n +` the first element of the list appended to the end, `val` is an empty list, `i` is 1, the current value of `c` is 1, `sx` is 0, `y` is `y -` sum of all integer divisions of all elements in `val` by 2, and `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`, and the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2` is being printed.**
