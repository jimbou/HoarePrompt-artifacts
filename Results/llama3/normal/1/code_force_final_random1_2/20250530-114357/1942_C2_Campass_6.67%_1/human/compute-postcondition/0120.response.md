Output: **the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 (where n is an integer, x is at least 1, sx is the number of times c is 1 plus 2 times y if y is less than c, otherwise sx is the number of times c is 1 plus the sum of all elements in val, c is the integer division of the last element in the list by 2, and y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2)**
