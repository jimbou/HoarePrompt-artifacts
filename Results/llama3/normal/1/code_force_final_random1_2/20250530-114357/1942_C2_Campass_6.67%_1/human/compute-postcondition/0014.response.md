The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer, x is greater than 2, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing three elements which are the difference between the second element and the first element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element and the second element of l minus 1 and the difference between the third element and the second element of l minus 1, i is 3, c is the difference between the third element and the second element of l minus 1. If c is 1 then sx is 2, otherwise sx is 1.**
