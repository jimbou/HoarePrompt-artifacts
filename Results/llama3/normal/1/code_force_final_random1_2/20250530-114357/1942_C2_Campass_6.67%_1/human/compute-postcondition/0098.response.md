Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than x, stdin contains t - x - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 2, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing three elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1, l[2] - l[1] - 1 and l[3] - l[2] - 1, i is 3, sx is 2 if c is 1, otherwise sx is 1, c is l[3] - l[2] - 1, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is printed**.

In this output state, the value of `val` has been updated to include the new element `c`, which is equal to `l[3] - l[2] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t - x - 2` inputs, each consisting of two lines. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `l`, `i`, `sx`, `c`, and `cons` are still valid and unchanged.
