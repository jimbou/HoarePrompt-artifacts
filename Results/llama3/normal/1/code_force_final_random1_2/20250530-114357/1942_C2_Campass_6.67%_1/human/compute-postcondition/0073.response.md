Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is `x` less than its original value, `stdin` contains `t - x` inputs, `n` is an integer, `x` is at least 1, `y` is `y - c - c`, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n +` the first element of the list appended to the end, `val` is a sorted list containing `x - 1` elements, where even numbers come first, then odd numbers, `i` is the `(k+1)`-th element in the list, `sx` is `sx + i + i + 2 * (y - c - c)` if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise `sx` is `sx + i + i`, `c` is `i // 2`, and `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx + 2 * (y - c - c) - 2` if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2**.

The code only updates the value of `c`, which is now equal to `i // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
