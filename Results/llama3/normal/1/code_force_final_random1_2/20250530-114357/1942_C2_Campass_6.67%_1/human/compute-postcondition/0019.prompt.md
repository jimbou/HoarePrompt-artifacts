Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    if c == 1:
        sx += 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer, x is greater than 0, y is an integer, if c is 1 then sx is 1, otherwise sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing two elements which are the difference between the second element and the first element of l minus 1 and c, i is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer, x is greater than 1, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing three elements which are the difference between the second element and the first element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element and the second element of l minus 1 and the difference between the third element and the second element of l minus 1, i is 2, c is the difference between the third element and the second element of l minus 1. If c is 1 then sx is 2, otherwise sx is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer, x is greater than 2, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing four elements which are the difference between the second element and the first element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element and the second element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element and the second element of l minus 1 and the difference between the fourth element and the third element of l minus 1, i is 3, c is the difference between the fourth element and the third element of l minus 1, If c is 1 then sx is 3, otherwise sx is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
