Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer, x is greater than 1, y is an integer, if c is 1 then sx is 1, otherwise sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing two elements which are the difference between the second element and the first element of l minus 1 and c, i is 2, c is the difference between the third element and the second element of l minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated to be the difference between the third element and the second element of `l` minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
