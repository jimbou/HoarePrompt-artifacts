Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than x, stdin contains t - x - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 2, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing two elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1 and l[2] - l[1] - 1, i is 3, sx is 2 if c is 1, otherwise sx is 1, c is l[3] - l[2] - 1, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is printed**

In this output state, the value of sx has been incremented by 1. If c is 1, sx is now 2; otherwise, sx is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
