Output State: **`t` is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value, `stdin` contains `t - 2` inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, `n` is an integer, `x` is at least 2, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n +` the first element of the list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing `c` and `c`, `i` is 3, `c` is either `l[2] - l[1] - 1` or not 1, if `c` is 1 then `sx` is 3, otherwise `sx` is 2, `y` is `y -` sum of all integer divisions of all elements in `val` by 2, and `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`, and the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2` is being printed, and `c` is now equal to `l[3] - l[2] - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `sx` has been incremented by 1. If `c` was 1, then `sx` is now 3; otherwise, `sx` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
