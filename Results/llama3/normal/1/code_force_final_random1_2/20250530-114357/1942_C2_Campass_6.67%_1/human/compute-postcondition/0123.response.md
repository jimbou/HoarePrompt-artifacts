Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It then calculates the minimum number of consecutive integers that can be formed using the given integers and the additional integer y, and prints this minimum number for each test case. The function continues to process test cases until the input is exhausted.**
