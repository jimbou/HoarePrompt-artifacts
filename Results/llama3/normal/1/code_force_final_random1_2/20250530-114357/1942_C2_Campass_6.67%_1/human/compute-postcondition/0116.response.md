Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than x, n is an integer, x is at least 1, y is y - c - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2 - c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least 3 elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1, l[2] - l[1] - 1, ..., l[x] - l[x - 1] - 1, l[x + 1] - l[x] - 1, i is the third element in the list, sx is the number of times c is 1 plus 2 times y if y is less than c, otherwise sx is the number of times c is 1 plus i, c is the integer division of the third element in the list by 2 which is equal to the integer division of i by 2, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is printed, val is a list that must have at least 3 elements, stdin contains 0 inputs. If y is less than c, then the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
