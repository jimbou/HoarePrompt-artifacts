Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer, x is greater than 2, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing four elements which are the difference between the second element and the first element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element and the second element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element and the second element of l minus 1 and the difference between the fourth element and the third element of l minus 1, i is 3, c is the difference between the fourth element and the third element of l minus 1, If c is 1 then sx is 3, otherwise sx is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `val` has been updated by appending the value of `c` to the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
