Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value, stdin contains t - x inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 1, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing x elements, where even numbers come first, then odd numbers, i is the first element of val, sx is sx + y * 2 if y is less than c, otherwise sx remains the same, c is i // 2, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2.***
