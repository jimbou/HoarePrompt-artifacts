Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer, x is 0, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing at least 1 element which are the difference between the second element and the first element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element and the second element of l minus 1, the difference between the fourth element and the third element of l minus 1, and so on until the difference between the last element and the second last element of l minus 1, sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x), i is the first element of val, c is the difference between the last element and the second last element of l minus 1, If c is 1 then sx is x, otherwise sx is x - 1, c is the integer division of i by 2. If y is less than c, then sx is sx + 2y, otherwise sx remains unchanged, sx is sx + i, y is y - c.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of t remains unchanged, still greater than 0 and one less than its original value. The stdin still contains t - 2 inputs, each input being a test case consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The values of n, x, and y remain unchanged. The list l remains a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end. The list val remains a sorted list containing at least 1 element which are the differences between consecutive elements of l minus 1, sorted by the key (1 - x & 1, x). The value of i remains the first element of val. The value of c remains the difference between the last element and the second last element of l minus 1. The value of sx is updated to sx + i. The value of y is updated to y - c.
