Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is an empty list, i is out of range of val, c is the integer division of the last element of val by 2, sx is 0, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    if c == 1:
        sx += 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value, `stdin` contains `t - 2` inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, `n` is an integer, `x` is at least 1, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n +` the first element of the list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing `c`, `i` is 1, `c` is either 1 or not 1, `sx` is 1 if `c` is 1, `y` is `y -` sum of all integer divisions of all elements in `val` by 2, and `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`, and the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value, `stdin` contains `t - 2` inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, `n` is an integer, `x` is at least 1, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n +` the first element of the list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing `c` and `c`, `i` is 2, `c` is either `l[2] - l[1] - 1` or not 1, if `c` is 1 then `sx` is 2, otherwise `sx` is 1, `y` is `y -` sum of all integer divisions of all elements in `val` by 2, and `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`, and the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value, `stdin` contains `t - 2` inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, `n` is an integer, `x` is at least 2, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n +` the first element of the list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing `c`, `c`, and `c`, `i` is 3, `c` is either `l[2] - l[1] - 1` or not 1, if `c` is 1 then `sx` is 3, otherwise `sx` is 2, `y` is `y -` sum of all integer divisions of all elements in `val` by 2, and `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`, and the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2` is being printed, and `c` is now equal to `l[3] - l[2] - 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
