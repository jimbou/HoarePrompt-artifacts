Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer, x is 0, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing x + 1 elements which are the difference between the second element and the first element of l minus 1, the difference between the third element and the second element of l minus 1, the difference between the fourth element and the third element of l minus 1, and so on until the difference between the last element and the second last element of l minus 1, i is x, c is the difference between the last element and the second last element of l minus 1, If c is 1 then sx is x, otherwise sx is x - 1.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `x` will be 0, the value of `i` will be equal to the original value of `x`, the list `val` will contain `x + 1` elements which are the differences between consecutive elements of the list `l` minus 1, and the value of `sx` will be equal to the number of times the difference between consecutive elements of `l` is 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
