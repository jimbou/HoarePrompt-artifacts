Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value, stdin contains t - x inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is 0, y is an integer, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing x elements, where even numbers come first, then odd numbers, i is x, c is l[x] - l[x - 1] - 1, sx is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in l is 1, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value, stdin contains t - x inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 1, y is y - c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing x elements, where even numbers come first, then odd numbers, i is the first element of val, sx is sx + i, c is i // 2, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value, stdin contains t - x inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 1, y is y - c - c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing x - 1 elements, where even numbers come first, then odd numbers, i is either even or odd, sx is sx + i + i + 2 * (y - c - c) if y is less than c, otherwise sx is sx + i + i, c is i // 2, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx + 2 * (y - c - c) - 2 if y is less than c, otherwise cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value, stdin contains t - x inputs, n is an integer, x is at least 1, y is y - c - c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing x - 1 elements, where even numbers come first, then odd numbers, i is the (k+1)-th element in the list, sx is sx + i + i + 2 * (y - c - c) if y is less than c, otherwise sx is sx + i + i, c is i // 2, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx + 2 * (y - c - c) - 2 if y is less than c, otherwise cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, sx is sx + y * 2 if y is less than c, otherwise sx remains unchanged, y is y - c.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
