Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value, stdin contains t - x inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 1, y is y - c - c, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing x - 1 elements, where even numbers come first, then odd numbers, i is either even or odd, sx is sx + i + i + 2 * (y - c - c) if y is less than c, otherwise sx is sx + i + i, c is i // 2, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx + 2 * (y - c - c) - 2 if y is less than c, otherwise cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2.**

In this output state, the values of `sx` and `y` have been updated based on the provided code. The value of `sx` has been incremented by `i` twice, and the value of `y` has been decremented by `c` twice. The other variables remain unchanged.
