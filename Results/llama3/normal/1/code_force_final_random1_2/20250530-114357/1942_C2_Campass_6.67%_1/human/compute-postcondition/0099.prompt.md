Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than x, stdin contains t - x - 1 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 1, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is an empty list, i is the last element of val, sx is 0, c is the integer division of the last element of val by 2, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
    if c == 1:
        sx += 1
    val.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than x, stdin contains t - x - 1 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 1, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing one element which is l[1] - l[0] - 1, i is l[1] - l[0] - 1, sx is 0, c is l[1] - l[0] - 1, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is printed, i is 1. If c is 1, sx is 1 and the current value of c is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than x, stdin contains t - x - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 2, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing two elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1 and l[2] - l[1] - 1, i is 2, sx is 1 if c is 1, otherwise sx is 0, c is l[2] - l[1] - 1, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than x, stdin contains t - x - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 2, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing three elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1, l[2] - l[1] - 1 and l[3] - l[2] - 1, i is 3, sx is 2 if c is 1, otherwise sx is 1, c is l[3] - l[2] - 1, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
