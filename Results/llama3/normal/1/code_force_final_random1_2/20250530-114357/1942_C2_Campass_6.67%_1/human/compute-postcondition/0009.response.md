The only variables in the loop head are variable i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and x. If i is less than x + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, x is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, i must be increased by 1, so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again x must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer, x is greater than 1, y is an integer, if c is 1 then sx is 1, otherwise sx is 0, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing two elements which are the difference between the second element and the first element of l minus 1 and c, i is 2**
