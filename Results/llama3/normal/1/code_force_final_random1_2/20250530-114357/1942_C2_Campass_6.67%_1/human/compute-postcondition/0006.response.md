Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, stdin contains t - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer, x is greater than 0, y is an integer, sx is 1, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing one element which is the difference between the second element and the first element of l minus 1, i is 1. The current value of c is 1**

The code increments the value of sx by 1. The value of sx was initially 0, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
