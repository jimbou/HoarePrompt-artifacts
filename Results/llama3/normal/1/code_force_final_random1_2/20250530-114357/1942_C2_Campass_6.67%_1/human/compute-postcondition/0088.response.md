Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than x, stdin contains t - x - 1 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 1, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing one element which is l[1] - l[0] - 1, i is l[1] - l[0] - 1, sx is 0, c is l[1] - l[0] - 1, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is printed, i is 1. If c is 1, sx is 1 and the current value of c is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains greater than 0 and is still x less than its original value, and the original value of `t` is still greater than `x`. The stdin still contains `t - x - 1` inputs, each input being a test case consisting of two lines. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `l`, `sx`, `c`, and `cons` remain unchanged. The list `val` now contains one element, which is `l[1] - l[0] - 1`. The value of `i` is now `l[1] - l[0] - 1`. If `c` is 1, then `sx` is 1 and the current value of `c` is still 1.
