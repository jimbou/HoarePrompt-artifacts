Output: **t is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value, stdin contains t - x inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 1, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is an empty list, i is the last element of val, sx is sx + sum of all elements in val + 2 * (y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2) if y is less than the integer division of the last element of val by 2, otherwise sx is sx + sum of all elements in val, c is the integer division of the last element of val by 2, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is printed**
