Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than x, stdin contains 0 inputs, n is an integer, x is at least 1, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a sorted list containing x elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1, l[2] - l[1] - 1, ..., l[x] - l[x - 1] - 1, i is the first element in the list, sx is the number of times c is 1 plus 2 times y, c is l[x] - l[x - 1] - 1, cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is printed, val is a list that must have at least 1 element, and c is the integer division of the first element in the list by 2. The current value of y is less than c**
