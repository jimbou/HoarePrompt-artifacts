Output State: **`t` is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value, `stdin` contains `t - 2` inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, `n` is an integer, `x` is at least 1, `y` is an integer, `l` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `n +` the first element of the list appended to the end, `val` is a list containing `c`, `i` is 1, `c` is either 1 or not 1, `sx` is 1 if `c` is 1, `y` is `y -` sum of all integer divisions of all elements in `val` by 2, and `cons` is the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`, and the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2` is being printed.**

The code appends the value of `c` to the list `val`. The value of `c` is either 1 or not 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `y` is still dependent on the sum of all integer divisions of all elements in `val` by 2, which now includes the newly appended value `c`. The value of `cons` remains the same as it is not affected by the change in `val`. The minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2` is still being printed.
