Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is x less than its original value and the original value of t must be greater than x, stdin contains t - x - 2 inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two lines, n is an integer, x is at least 2, y is y - sum of all integer divisions of all elements in val by 2, l is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n with n + the first element of the list appended to the end, val is a list containing two elements which are l[1] - l[0] - 1 and l[2] - l[1] - 1, i is 3, sx is 1 if c is 1, otherwise sx is 0, c is l[3] - l[2] - 1, and cons is the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2, and the minimum of n - 2 and x + sx - 2 is printed**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated to `l[3] - l[2] - 1`, which is the difference between the third and second elements of the list `l`, minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t - x - 2` inputs, each consisting of two lines. The list `l` is still a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with `n` and the first element of the list appended to the end. The list `val` still contains two elements, which are `l[1] - l[0] - 1` and `l[2] - l[1] - 1`. The variable `i` is still 3, and `sx` is still 1 if `c` is 1, otherwise it is 0. The variable `cons` is still the minimum of `n - 2` and `x + sx - 2`, and this value is printed.
