Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `n` is non-negative and `k` is non-negative, and the values of `n` and `k` are returned by the function `func_4()`**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the result of the function `func_4()`, which returns a tuple of two integers. The non-negativity of `n` and `k` is still valid, as the function does not change their signs. The output state describes the updated values of `n` and `k` in a way that is easily understandable by humans.
