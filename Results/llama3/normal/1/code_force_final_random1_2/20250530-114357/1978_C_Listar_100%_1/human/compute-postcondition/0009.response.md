Based on the precondition, the list `l` has at least 3 integers, and `i` is the third integer in the list. The `print` statement is printing the value of `i` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` argument).

Since `i` is the third integer in the list, its value is the third element of the list `l`. The precondition does not specify the exact values of the integers in the list, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i`.

However, we can describe the output as the third integer in the list `l`, followed by a space.

Output: **the third integer in the list l**
