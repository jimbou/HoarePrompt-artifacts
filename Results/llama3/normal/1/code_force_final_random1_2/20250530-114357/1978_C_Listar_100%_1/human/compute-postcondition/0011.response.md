Output State: **l is an empty list, 'YES' is being printed, and all the integers in the list are being printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `l` will be empty because all its elements have been iterated over and printed. The variable `i` will no longer be defined because it is only defined within the scope of the loop. The string `'YES'` will still be being printed because the loop does not affect this. Finally, all the integers that were in the list `l` will have been printed, separated by spaces, because that is what the loop does.
