This function takes a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k` as input, and returns a list of integers from 1 to `n`. The function iterates over the list, potentially modifying it by calling `func_3`, and keeps track of the number of iterations `c`. If `k` becomes 0 or less than the current iteration index, the function returns the list. Otherwise, it continues iterating and modifying the list until the loop completes, at which point it returns the final list.
