Output State: **The program returns nothing.**

Since the return statement is empty, the program does not return any value. The initial state mentions that 'YES' is being printed, all integers in the list are being printed, and nothing is being printed, but these statements do not affect the return value. The list 'l' being empty also does not impact the return value. Therefore, the program simply returns nothing.
