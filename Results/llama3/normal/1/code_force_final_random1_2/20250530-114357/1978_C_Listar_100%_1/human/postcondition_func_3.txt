This function takes two integers, n and k, as input from the user, where n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer. It checks if k is even and if n is odd or even. If k is odd, the function returns two zeros. If k is even, it calculates a maximum value max_k based on whether n is odd or even. If max_k is less than k, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it returns the original values of n and k. The function effectively filters the input values based on the parity of k and the relationship between max_k and k, returning either the original values or zeros.
