Output State: **n is a non-negative integer not equal to 0, k is a non-negative integer, l is the return value of func_1(n, k)**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the return value of `func_1(n, k)` to `l`. Since `n` and `k` are integers, and `func_1` is a function that takes two arguments, the return value of `func_1(n, k)` is assigned to `l`. The second line calls `func_5(l)`, but since the return value of `func_5` is not assigned to any variable, it does not affect the state of the program.

The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers, `n` is non-negative, `k` is non-negative, and `n` is not equal to 0. These conditions remain valid after the code execution. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `l`, which is assigned the return value of `func_1(n, k)`.
