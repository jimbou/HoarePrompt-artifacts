Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive, i is 2, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains t-2 integers, word is an empty string**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was already an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive, its value is updated to the input value, which is also an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive. The second line initializes `word` as an empty string. 

No other variables are affected by the code. The value of `i` remains 2, and `alphabet` remains a string of all lowercase English letters. The state of `stdin` is updated to contain `t-2` integers, as one integer was consumed by the `input()` function. The value of `word` is now an empty string.
