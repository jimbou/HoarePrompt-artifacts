Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains t-1 integers, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 27 and 52 inclusive, `word` is a string that starts with 'a', followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet, and ends with 'z'.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is still between 3 and 52 inclusive, but since it is higher than 26, it is now between 27 and 52 inclusive. The value of `word` has been updated to include the character 'a', the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet, and the character 'z'. The other variables remain unchanged.
