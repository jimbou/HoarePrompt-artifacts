This function generates and prints a series of strings based on input integers. It accepts a number of test cases (t) and then t integers (n), each between 3 and 78. For each n, it constructs a string according to specific rules: if n is greater than 52, the string is a lowercase letter followed by 'zz'; if n is between 27 and 52, the string starts with 'a', followed by a letter determined by n, and ends with 'z'; if n is between 3 and 26, the string starts with 'aa' followed by a letter determined by n. The function prints each constructed string. After execution, the standard input is empty, having processed all inputs.
