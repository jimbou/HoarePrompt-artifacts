Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) and then t integers n (3 <= n <= 78)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 26:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains t-2 integers, i is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive, and word is printed which is a string that depends on the value of n. If n is greater than 52, word starts with the (n-52)th letter of the alphabet followed by 'zz'. If n is between 27 and 52 inclusive, word starts with 'a', followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet, and ends with 'z'. If n is between 3 and 26 inclusive, word is 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains t-2 integers, i is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive. If n is larger than 52, word is a string that contains the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet and 'zz'. If n is between 28 and 52 inclusive, word is a string 'a' followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet and then 'z'. If n is between 3 and 26 inclusive, word is a string that starts with 'aa' followed by the (n-3)th letter of the alphabet, and the word is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive, i is 2, alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains t-2 integers. If n is larger than 52, word is a string that is either empty or contains a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive) followed by 'zz'. If n is larger than 26 but not larger than 52, word is a string that starts with 'a' followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet and ends with 'z'. If n is between 3 and 26 inclusive, word is a string 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet, and word is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
