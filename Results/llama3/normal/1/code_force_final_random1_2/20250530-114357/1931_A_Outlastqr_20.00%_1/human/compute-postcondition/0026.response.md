Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive, `i` is 2, `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `stdin` contains t-2 integers, `word` is a string that starts with 'a' followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet and ends with 'z'.**

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated by concatenating 'a', the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet, and 'z'. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still between 3 and 78 inclusive, `i` is still 2, `alphabet` is still a string of all lowercase English letters, and `stdin` still contains t-2 integers.
