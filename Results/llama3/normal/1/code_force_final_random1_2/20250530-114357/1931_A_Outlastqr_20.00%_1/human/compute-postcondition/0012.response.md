Based on the precondition, we can determine the value of `word` based on the value of `n`.

If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is a string that starts with the `(n-52)`th letter of the alphabet followed by 'zz'. Since `n` is between 3 and 78 inclusive, the possible values of `n` that satisfy this condition are 53 to 78. Therefore, the `(n-52)`th letter of the alphabet will be the 1st to 26th letter of the alphabet, which are 'a' to 'z' respectively. So, `word` will be a string that starts with 'a' to 'z' followed by 'zz'.

If `n` is between 27 and 52 inclusive, `word` is a string that starts with 'a', followed by the `(n-28)`th letter of the alphabet, and ends with 'z'. The possible values of `n` that satisfy this condition are 27 to 52. Therefore, the `(n-28)`th letter of the alphabet will be the 1st to 26th letter of the alphabet, which are 'a' to 'z' respectively (with 'a' corresponding to 27 and 'z' corresponding to 52). So, `word` will be a string that starts with 'a', followed by 'a' to 'z', and ends with 'z'.

If `n` is between 3 and 26 inclusive, `word` is 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]. The possible values of `n` that satisfy this condition are 3 to 26. Therefore, `alphabet[n - 3]` will be the 1st to 23rd letter of the alphabet, which are 'a' to 'w' respectively (with 'a' corresponding to 3 and 'w' corresponding to 26). So, `word` will be 'aa' followed by 'a' to 'w'.

In summary, the value of `word` depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` starts with 'a' to 'z' followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 27 and 52 inclusive, `word` starts with 'a', followed by 'a' to 'z', and ends with 'z'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 inclusive, `word` is 'aa' followed by 'a' to 'w'.

Output: **word (where word is a string that starts with 'a' to 'z' followed by 'zz' if n is greater than 52, starts with 'a', followed by 'a' to 'z', and ends with 'z' if n is between 27 and 52 inclusive, and is 'aa' followed by 'a' to 'w' if n is between 3 and 26 inclusive)**
