Output State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive, `word` is a string 'a' followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet and then 'z', stdin contains t-2 integers.**

In this output state, the value of `word` has been updated to include the characters 'a', the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet (which is a specific letter between 'a' and 'z' since n is between 3 and 78), and 'z'. The other variables remain unchanged.
