Output State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains t-1 integers n, i is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive, word is an empty string**

The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable n. Since stdin initially contains an integer t and then t integers n, after reading one integer, stdin will be left with t-1 integers n. The variable i remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The variable n is assigned a value between 3 and 78 inclusive, as specified in the initial state. The variable word is initialized as an empty string. The alphabet variable remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
