The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i. If i is less than the number of integers in stdin, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, stdin contains t-2 integers. For the loop to execute again i must be 2 and stdin contains t-1 integers.
State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains t-1 integers, i is 2, n is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive. If n is larger than 52, word is a string that contains the (n-53)th letter of the alphabet and 'zz'. If n is between 28 and 52 inclusive, word is a string 'a' followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet and then 'z'. If n is between 3 and 26 inclusive, word is a string that starts with 'aa' followed by the (n-3)th letter of the alphabet, and the word is printed**
