Based on the initial state, we can determine the value of `word` and thus what will be printed.

Since `n` is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive, we need to consider the three cases:

1. If `n` is between 3 and 26 inclusive, `word` is a string that starts with 'aa' followed by the `(n-3)`th letter of the alphabet. Since `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, the `(n-3)`th letter of the alphabet will be a letter between 'a' and 'z', depending on the value of `n`. For example, if `n` is 3, `word` will be 'aaa', if `n` is 4, `word` will be 'aab', and so on.

2. If `n` is between 28 and 52 inclusive, `word` is a string 'a' followed by the `(n-28)`th letter of the alphabet and then 'z'. Again, the `(n-28)`th letter of the alphabet will be a letter between 'a' and 'z', depending on the value of `n`. For example, if `n` is 28, `word` will be 'azz', if `n` is 29, `word` will be 'abz', and so on.

3. If `n` is larger than 52, `word` is a string that contains the `(n-53)`th letter of the alphabet and 'zz'. The `(n-53)`th letter of the alphabet will be a letter between 'a' and 'z', depending on the value of `n`. For example, if `n` is 53, `word` will be 'azz', if `n` is 54, `word` will be 'bzz', and so on.

In all cases, `word` is a string that contains a combination of letters from the alphabet, depending on the value of `n`.

Output: **a string containing a combination of letters from the alphabet, depending on the value of n**
