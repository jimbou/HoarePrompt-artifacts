The code prints the value of `word` which is a string that depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` starts with the `(n-52)`th letter of the alphabet followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 27 and 52 inclusive, `word` starts with 'a', followed by the `(n-28)`th letter of the alphabet, and ends with 'z'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 inclusive, `word` is 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3].
Output: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin contains t-2 integers, i is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive, and word is printed which is a string that depends on the value of n. If n is greater than 52, word starts with the (n-52)th letter of the alphabet followed by 'zz'. If n is between 27 and 52 inclusive, word starts with 'a', followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet, and ends with 'z'. If n is between 3 and 26 inclusive, word is 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]**
