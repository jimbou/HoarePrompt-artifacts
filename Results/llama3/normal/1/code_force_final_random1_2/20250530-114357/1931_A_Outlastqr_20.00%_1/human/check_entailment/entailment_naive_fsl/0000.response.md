Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly handles all possible cases for the encoded word. The program first checks if the encoded word is greater than 52, in which case it subtracts 53 from the encoded word and uses the resulting value as the index for the first letter of the word. If the encoded word is between 26 and 52, it adds 'a' as the first letter and uses the remaining value as the index for the second letter. If the encoded word is less than or equal to 26, it adds 'aa' as the first two letters and uses the remaining value as the index for the third letter.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the encoded word is 3, 26, or 78, and produces the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded.

The use of the `string.ascii_lowercase` constant to get the alphabet and the indexing of the alphabet to get the corresponding letter for the encoded word is also correct.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
