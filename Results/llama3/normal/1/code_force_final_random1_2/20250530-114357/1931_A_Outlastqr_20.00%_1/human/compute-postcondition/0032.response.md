Output State: **alphabet is a string of all lowercase English letters, stdin is empty, i is t-1, n is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive. If n is larger than 52, word is a string that is either empty or contains a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive) followed by 'zz'. If n is larger than 26 but not larger than 52, word is a string that starts with 'a' followed by the (n-28)th letter of the alphabet and ends with 'z'. If n is between 3 and 26 inclusive, word is a string 'aa' followed by the (n-2)th letter of the alphabet, and word is printed**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the state of the program is such that the alphabet remains unchanged, the standard input is empty because all the input values have been read, the loop counter `i` is one less than the total number of iterations `t`, and the value of `n` is still an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive. The value of `word` depends on the value of `n` and is either empty or a string that follows the same pattern as before, with the only difference being that `n` is now the last input value read.
