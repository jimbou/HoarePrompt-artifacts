To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters
- `stdin` contains `t-2` integers
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive
- `word` is printed which is a string that depends on the value of `n`

Since `i` is the loop variable, it needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the number of integers left in `stdin`. Since `stdin` contains `t-2` integers and `i` is 0, `stdin` must contain at least 1 integer for the loop to execute again.

The state of `alphabet`, `n`, and `word` does not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`alphabet` is a string of all lowercase English letters, `stdin` contains `t-1` integers, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive, and `word` is printed which is a string that depends on the value of `n`**
