Based on the initial state, the value of `word` depends on the value of `n`. There are three possible cases:

1. If `n` is larger than 52, `word` is a string that is either empty or contains a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive) followed by 'zz'. Since `n` is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive, this case is possible.

2. If `n` is larger than 26 but not larger than 52, `word` is a string that starts with 'a' followed by the `(n-28)`th letter of the `alphabet` and ends with 'z'. Since `n` is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive, this case is also possible.

3. If `n` is between 3 and 26 inclusive, `word` is a string 'aa' followed by the `(n-2)`th letter of the `alphabet`. Since `n` is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive, this case is also possible.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine which case will occur. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(word)` statement will output the value of `word` according to the case that corresponds to the value of `n`.

Output: **word (where word is a string that depends on the value of n, following one of the three cases described above)**
