Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `m` is one less than `n`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` and `n` have different parity, 'No' is printed.***
