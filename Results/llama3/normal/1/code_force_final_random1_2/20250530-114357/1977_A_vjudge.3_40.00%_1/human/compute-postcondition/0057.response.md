Based on the precondition, the code will print the string 'Yes' when the print statement is executed.

The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` are not used in the print statement, so their values do not affect the output.

The stdin (standard input) contains a space-separated list of integers, but this information is not relevant to the print statement, as it only prints a fixed string 'Yes'.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'Yes' regardless of the values of the variables and the input.

Output: **Yes**
