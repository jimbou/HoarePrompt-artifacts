Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers. `n` is not equal to `m`. `m` is less than or equal to `n` and `m` is not equal to `n - 1`. If both `m` and `n` are even numbers, 'Yes' is printed. If both `m` and `n` are odd numbers, 'Yes' is printed. If either `m` or `n` is odd and the other is even, 'No' is printed.***
