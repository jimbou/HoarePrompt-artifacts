Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin is empty, `i` is `t`, `n` and `m` are the last two integers read from stdin. If `n` equals `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `n` does not equal `m`, then if `m` > `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` is one less than `n`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` and `n` are both even or both odd, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` and `n` have different parity, 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` remains the same, stdin is empty because all the lines have been read, and `i` is equal to `t` because the loop has executed `t` times. The values of `n` and `m` are the last two integers read from stdin. The output state is determined by the same conditions as before, depending on the values of `n` and `m`.
