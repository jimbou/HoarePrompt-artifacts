State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers. If `n` is equal to `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `n` is not equal to `m`, then if `m` is greater than `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` is less than or equal to `n`, then if `m` is one less than `n`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` is not one less than `n`, then if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd, 'Yes' is printed. If one of `m` or `n` is odd and the other is even, 'No' is printed.**
