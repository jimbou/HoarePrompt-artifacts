Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking various conditions based on the values of n and m.

1. If n equals m, the program prints 'Yes'. This is correct because Nikita can simply add 1 cube on top of the tower n times to get a tower with m cubes.

2. If m is greater than n, the program prints 'No'. This is correct because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has.

3. If m equals n - 1, the program prints 'Yes'. This is correct because Nikita can add 1 cube on top of the tower n - 1 times and then remove 1 cube to get a tower with m cubes.

4. If both m and n are even, the program prints 'Yes'. This is correct because Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs to get a tower with m cubes.

5. If both m and n are odd, the program prints 'Yes'. This is correct because Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs and then add or remove one more cube to get a tower with m cubes.

6. In all other cases, the program prints 'No'. This is correct because if the conditions above are not met, it's not possible to get a tower with m cubes after n moves.

The program correctly covers all possible cases and provides the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
