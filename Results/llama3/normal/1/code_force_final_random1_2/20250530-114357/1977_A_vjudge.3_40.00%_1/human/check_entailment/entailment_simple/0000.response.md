Reasoning: The program correctly determines if it's possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves. The conditions in the if-elif-else statements cover all possible scenarios:

- If n equals m, it's possible to have a tower with m cubes by adding m cubes.
- If m is greater than n, it's not possible to have a tower with m cubes because Nikita can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
- If m is one less than n, it's possible to have a tower with m cubes by adding m cubes and then removing one cube.
- If m and n have the same parity (both even or both odd), it's possible to have a tower with m cubes by adding or removing cubes in pairs.
- If m and n have different parity, it's not possible to have a tower with m cubes because Nikita can't change the parity of the number of cubes by adding or removing cubes in pairs.

Correctness: **True**
