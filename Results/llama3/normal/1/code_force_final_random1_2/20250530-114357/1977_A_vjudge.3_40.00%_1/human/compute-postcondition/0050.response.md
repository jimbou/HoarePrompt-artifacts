Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are updated to be integers assigned from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. The stdin is now not empty and contains a space-separated list of integers.
