Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to build a tower with a certain number of cubes after a given number of moves. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two integers, n and m, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

The program then applies a set of rules to determine whether the desired number of cubes is compatible with the number of moves. The rules are as follows:

1. If n equals m, the program prints 'Yes'.
2. If m is greater than n, the program prints 'No'.
3. If m is one less than n, the program prints 'Yes'.
4. If m and n are both even or both odd, the program prints 'Yes'.
5. If m and n have different parity, the program prints 'No'.

The program processes all test cases and empties the standard input.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program correctly implements the rules for determining whether the desired number of cubes is compatible with the number of moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
