Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program checks all possible cases:

- If n equals m, it is possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding one cube at a time.
- If m is greater than n, it is not possible to build a tower with m cubes because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time.
- If m equals n - 1, it is possible to build a tower with m cubes by adding one cube at a time and then removing one cube.
- If both m and n are even or both are odd, it is possible to build a tower with m cubes because Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs.
- In all other cases, it is not possible to build a tower with m cubes.

The program correctly handles all these cases and provides the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
