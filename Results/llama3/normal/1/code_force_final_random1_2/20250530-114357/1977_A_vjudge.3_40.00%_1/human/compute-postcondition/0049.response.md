State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers assigned from the input, stdin is empty. If `n` equals `m`, 'Yes' is printed. If `m` is greater than `n`, 'No' is printed. If `m` is one less than `n`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
