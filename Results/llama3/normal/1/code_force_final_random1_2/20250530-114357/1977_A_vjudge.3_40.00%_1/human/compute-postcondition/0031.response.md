Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers assigned from the input, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers input by the user, which are split by a space. The stdin is now empty since the input has been consumed.
