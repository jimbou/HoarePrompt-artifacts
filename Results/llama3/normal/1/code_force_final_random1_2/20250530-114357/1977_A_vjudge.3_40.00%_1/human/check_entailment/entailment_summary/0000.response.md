Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

- If n is equal to m, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by putting 1 cube on top of the tower n times in a row.
- If m is greater than n, it's not possible to build a tower with m cubes because Nikita can't put more cubes than the number of moves.
- If m is equal to n - 1, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes by putting 1 cube on top of the tower n - 1 times and then removing 1 cube.
- If both m and n are even or both are odd, it's possible to build a tower with m cubes because Nikita can put or remove cubes in pairs.

However, the program does not correctly handle the case where m is less than n - 1 and both m and n are not both even or both odd. In this case, it's still possible to build a tower with m cubes by putting 1 cube on top of the tower m times and then removing 1 cube n - m - 1 times.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not cover all possible cases.

Correctness: **False**
