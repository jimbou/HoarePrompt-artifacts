Based on the precondition, the code will print the string 'No' when the print statement is executed.

The value of `t` being greater than 1, the value of `i` being 2, and the values of `n` and `m` being integers do not affect the output of the print statement. The print statement simply prints the string 'No', regardless of the values of these variables.

Output: **No**
