The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to its opposite. Since `A` was initially `True`, it is now assigned the value `False`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If the difference between the second and first elements of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False.**
