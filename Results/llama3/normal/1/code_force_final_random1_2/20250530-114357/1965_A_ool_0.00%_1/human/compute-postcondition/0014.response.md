To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(set_)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `set_`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `set_` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, `set_` must still have at least 3 elements.

The other variables `arr`, `A`, and `not_c` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3**
