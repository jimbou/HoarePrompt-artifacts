Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is False**.

In this output state, the value of `arr` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `A` and assigned it the value `False`. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged state of `arr` and the new state of `A`.
