Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, `A` is False if the length of `set_` is even and True otherwise, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, `i` is equal to the length of `set_` minus 1, `not_c` is True**.

In natural language, the output state is: The list `arr` remains unchanged, with its first element still being 1. The value of `A` is toggled, so it is now the opposite of its original value, which was determined by the length of `set_`. The sorted list of unique positive integers `set_` and the index `i` remain unchanged. The variable `not_c` still indicates that there are no pairs of consecutive elements in `set_` with a difference greater than 1.
