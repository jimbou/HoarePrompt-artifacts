Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, `i` is equal to the length of `set_` minus 1. If there is no pair of consecutive elements in `set_` with a difference greater than 1, then `A` is False if the length of `set_` is even and True otherwise, and `not_c` is True. Otherwise, `not_c` is False.***
