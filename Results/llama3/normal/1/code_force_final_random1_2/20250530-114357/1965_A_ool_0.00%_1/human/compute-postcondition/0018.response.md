Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, `A` is True if the length of `set_` is even and False otherwise, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, `i` is equal to the length of `set_` minus 1, and `not_c` is False if there is a pair of consecutive elements in `set_` with a difference greater than 1 and True otherwise.**

This output state means that after the loop finishes executing, the list `arr` remains unchanged, the value of `A` depends on the length of `set_` (it's True if the length is even and False otherwise), the list `set_` remains the same, the variable `i` is equal to the last index of `set_`, and the variable `not_c` is False if there is a pair of consecutive elements in `set_` with a difference greater than 1 and True otherwise.
