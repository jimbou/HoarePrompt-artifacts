According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `set_`. If `set_` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is False, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, and `not_c` is True. However, these states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `set_` has at least 2 elements and `i` is now 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is False, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, `not_c` is True, `i` is 1**
