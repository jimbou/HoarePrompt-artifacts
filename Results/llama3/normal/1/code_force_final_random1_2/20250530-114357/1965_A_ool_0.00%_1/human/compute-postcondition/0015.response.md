Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr with at least 3 elements, i is 3, not_c is False**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `not_c = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `not_c`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that is typically used to exit a loop, but in this context, it does not affect any variables or the program state because it is not within a loop.

Given the initial state, the values of `arr`, `A`, `set_`, and `i` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not modify them. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `not_c` with the value `False`. Therefore, the final state includes all the initial variables with their unchanged values and the new variable `not_c` with its assigned value.
