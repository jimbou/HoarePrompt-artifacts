Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, where it only checks if the smallest pile size is 1 and then checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are 1. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine the winner of the game.

A counterexample is when the input is `[2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program will return `'Alice'`, but the correct answer is `'Bob'`. This is because Alice can only remove 2 stones from each pile on her first turn, leaving `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. Then, Bob can remove 1 stone from each pile, leaving `[0, 0, 1, 2]`. Finally, Alice can only remove 1 stone from each pile, leaving `[0, 0, 0, 1]`, and Bob wins.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to use the XOR operation. The winner of the game is the player who can make the XOR of all pile sizes equal to 0. This is because the XOR operation has the property that `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`. Therefore, if the XOR of all pile sizes is 0, the player can always make a move that makes the XOR of the remaining pile sizes equal to 0, and thus win the game.

Here is the correct code:
```
def func_1(arr):
    xor = 0
    for num in arr:
        xor ^= num
    return 'Alice' if xor != 0 else 'Bob'
```
This code correctly determines the winner of the game in all cases.
