Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers, A is False, the first element of arr is 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 2 elements, not_c is False, i is 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `not_c = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `not_c`, changing its initial state from `True` to `False`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not affect the state of any variables.

All other variables (`arr`, `A`, `set_`, and `i`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The initial state of `arr` being a list of positive integers, `A` being `False`, the first element of `arr` being 1, `set_` being a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 2 elements, and `i` being 1 are all preserved.
