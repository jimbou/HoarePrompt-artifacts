    #State: *`arr` is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, `i` is equal to the length of `set_` minus 1. If there is no pair of consecutive elements in `set_` with a difference greater than 1, then `A` is False if the length of `set_` is even and True otherwise, and `not_c` is True. Otherwise, `not_c` is False.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. If the length of `set_` is even, it returns 'Bob', otherwise it returns 'Alice'. The length of `set_` is the number of unique positive integers in `arr`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a list of positive integers contains a sequence of consecutive numbers starting from 1, and returns 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the parity of the number of unique integers in the list. If the first element of the list is not 1, it immediately returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks for consecutive numbers and updates a flag 'A' based on the length of the unique numbers. If all numbers are consecutive, it returns 'Bob' if the length of unique numbers is even, and 'Alice' otherwise. If there are gaps in the sequence, it returns 'Alice' if the length of unique numbers is odd, and 'Bob' if it's even.
