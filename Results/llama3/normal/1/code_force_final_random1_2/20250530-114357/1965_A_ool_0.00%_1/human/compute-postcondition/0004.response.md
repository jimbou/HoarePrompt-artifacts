Output State: **arr is a list of positive integers, A is False, the first element of arr is 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, not_c is True**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code snippet has modified the state of the program by introducing two new variables, `set_` and `not_c`. The variable `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from the original list `arr`. This means that if `arr` contained any duplicate integers, they have been removed in `set_`, and the remaining integers are sorted in ascending order. The variable `not_c` is a boolean value that has been set to `True`.

The original variables `arr` and `A` remain unchanged. The list `arr` is still a list of positive integers, and the first element of `arr` is still 1. The boolean variable `A` is still `False`.

In summary, the code has added two new variables, `set_` and `not_c`, while leaving the original variables `arr` and `A` unchanged.
