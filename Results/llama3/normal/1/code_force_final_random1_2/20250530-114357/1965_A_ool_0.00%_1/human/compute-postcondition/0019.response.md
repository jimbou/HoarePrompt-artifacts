Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, `A` is True if the length of `set_` is even and False otherwise, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, `i` is equal to the length of `set_` minus 1. The current value of `not_c` is True, indicating that there are no pairs of consecutive elements in `set_` with a difference greater than 1.***
