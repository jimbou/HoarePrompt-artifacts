Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is True, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is set to False. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.**

In this output state, the value of `A` has been changed to True, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` is still a list of positive integers, the first element of `arr` is still 1, `set_` is still a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 2 elements, and `i` is still 1. The condition for `not_c` also remains the same, depending on the difference between the current element and the previous element in `set_`.
