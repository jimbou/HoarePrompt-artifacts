The code snippet consists of two lines: `not_c = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `not_c`. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

Since the initial state includes the information that `A` is `True`, `arr` is a list of positive integers, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2, we can conclude that these variables remain unchanged after the execution of the code.

The only variable that is modified by the code is `not_c`, which is assigned the value `False`.

Output State: **A is True, arr is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr with at least 3 elements, i is 2, not_c is False**
