Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers with the first element being 1, `A` is True, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If the difference between the second and first elements of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is False. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
