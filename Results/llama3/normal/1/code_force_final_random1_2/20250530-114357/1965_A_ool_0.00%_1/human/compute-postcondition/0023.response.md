Functionality: **This function determines whether a list of positive integers contains a sequence of consecutive numbers starting from 1, and returns 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the parity of the number of unique integers in the list. If the first element of the list is not 1, it immediately returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks for consecutive numbers and updates a flag 'A' based on the length of the unique numbers. If all numbers are consecutive, it returns 'Bob' if the length of unique numbers is even, and 'Alice' otherwise. If there are gaps in the sequence, it returns 'Alice' if the length of unique numbers is odd, and 'Bob' if it's even.**
