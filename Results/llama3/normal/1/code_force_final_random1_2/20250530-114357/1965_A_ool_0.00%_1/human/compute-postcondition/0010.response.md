To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(set_)):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `set_`. Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.

The length of `set_` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again, because the loop starts from 1 and `i` is currently 1. If the length of `set_` is exactly 2, the loop will not execute again because `i` will be out of range.

The other variables in the state (`arr`, `A`, the first element of `arr`, and `not_c`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is True, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
