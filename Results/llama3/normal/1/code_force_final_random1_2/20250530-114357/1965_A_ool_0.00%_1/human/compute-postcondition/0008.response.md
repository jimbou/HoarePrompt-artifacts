Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of positive integers, `A` is False, the first element of `arr` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is set to False. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.***
