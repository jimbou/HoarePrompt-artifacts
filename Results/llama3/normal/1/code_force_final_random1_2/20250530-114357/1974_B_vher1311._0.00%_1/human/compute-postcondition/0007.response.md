The only variable in the loop head is variable  char, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, *s is a string of lowercase Latin letters. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 2 characters and the char is the second character in the string.
State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string**
