Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to decode a string that has been encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new string 'r', which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

The provided function `func_1(b)` is supposed to perform the decoding operation. However, the implementation of this function is not provided in the given code. Instead, the implementation of a function that seems to be doing the encoding operation is provided.

The encoding function first creates a list of unique characters from the input string 's' in ascending order. Then, it replaces each character in 's' with the last character in the list of unique characters. This process is repeated until all characters in 's' have been replaced.

However, this function does not perform the decoding operation as required by the problem statement. The decoding operation would involve replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the original string.

Therefore, based on the provided implementation, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
