To adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for char in s:`. The only variable in the loop head is `char`, which takes on the value of each character in the string `s` during each iteration.

Given that `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters, and considering the operations performed in the loop body (which are not directly relevant to adjusting the state for the next iteration but give context), we focus on `char` and `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `char` would have been the second character of `s` (since `s` has at least 2 characters), and certain operations might have been performed on `s` based on whether this character was already in `unique_chars` or not. However, these operations do not affect the loop's ability to proceed to the next character in `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to move to the next character in `s`. Since `s` has at least 2 characters and we've just processed the second character, for the loop to continue, `s` must have at least 3 characters. Thus, `char` should be the third character of `s` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`.**
