Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is intended to decode the encoded string `b` and return the original string `s`. However, the function does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm.

The function `func_1` replaces each character in the string `s` with the last unique character in ascending order, which is not the correct decoding process. The correct decoding process should replace each character in the string `b` with its symmetric character from the string `r`, where `r` is the string of all distinct letters of `b` in alphabetical order.

Moreover, the function `func_1` returns a string containing all unique characters from the input string in ascending order, which is not the original string `s`.

Correctness: **False**
