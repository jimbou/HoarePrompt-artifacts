Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the encoded string `b` and return the original string `s`. However, the provided implementation of `func_1` is actually the encoding function, not the decoding function.

The encoding function replaces each character in the string `s` with its symmetric character from the string `r`, which is the sorted list of unique characters in `s`. The decoding function should do the opposite: replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its symmetric character from the string `r`.

The provided implementation of `func_1` does not perform this decoding operation. Instead, it constructs the string `r` from the encoded string `b` and returns it, which is not the correct decoding result.

Correctness: **False**
