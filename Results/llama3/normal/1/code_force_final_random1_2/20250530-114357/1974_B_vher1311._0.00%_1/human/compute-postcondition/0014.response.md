Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of `char` in `s` have been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, and `j` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `char` has been inserted at index `i` in `unique_chars`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1.***
