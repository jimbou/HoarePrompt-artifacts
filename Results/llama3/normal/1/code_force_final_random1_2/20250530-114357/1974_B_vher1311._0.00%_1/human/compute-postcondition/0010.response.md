Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters. If the second character of `s` is already in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of this character in `s` are replaced by the character at the index one less than its original value in `unique_chars`. Otherwise, the second character of `s` is inserted into `unique_chars` at index `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1.***
