#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    i, j = 0, len(unique_chars) - 1
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
    #State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters where each character is replaced by the last character in unique_chars, unique_chars is a list of unique characters in s, sorted in ascending order, i is the number of unique characters in s, j is -1
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
    #The program returns a string that contains all unique characters from string 's', in ascending order.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input, replaces each character with the last unique character in ascending order, and returns a string containing all unique characters from the input string in ascending order.
