Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, unique_chars is a list of unique characters in s, sorted in ascending order, i is 0, j is the index of the last character in unique_chars
Code of the loop:
for char in s:
    if char in unique_chars:
        s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
        j -= 1
    else:
        unique_chars.insert(i, char)
        i += 1
        j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *s is a string of lowercase Latin letters. If the first character of s is already in the list of unique characters, all occurrences of the first character in s are replaced with the last character in unique_chars, and the last index in unique_chars is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the first character of s is added to the list of unique characters, and the index i is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters. If the second character of `s` is already in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of this character in `s` are replaced by the character at the index one less than its original value in `unique_chars`. Otherwise, the second character of `s` is inserted into `unique_chars` at index `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of `char` in `s` have been replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, and `j` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `char` has been inserted at index `i` in `unique_chars`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
