Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, char is the third character of s, unique_chars has char inserted at index i, i is incremented by 1, j is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `char` also remains the same, as it is not reassigned or modified. The list `unique_chars` now has the value of `char` inserted at index `i`, which means its length has increased by 1. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the value of `j` is also incremented by 1.
