According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s. If s is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, unique_chars is a list of unique characters in s, sorted in ascending order, i is 0, j is the index of the last character in unique_chars. So for the loop to be executed, s must not be empty and char is the first character in the string.
State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters that is not empty, unique_chars is a list of unique characters in s, sorted in ascending order, i is 0, j is the index of the last character in unique_chars, char is the first character in the string**
