To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2, since the range starts from 2. 

So, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 2.

The state of `i` is already 0, but since the loop starts from 2, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 2.

The other variables `k`, `_`, `res`, `best`, and `stdin` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, `_` is 1, `res` is either '<' or '>', `best` is an integer in the range [0, n-1], `stdin` is empty**
