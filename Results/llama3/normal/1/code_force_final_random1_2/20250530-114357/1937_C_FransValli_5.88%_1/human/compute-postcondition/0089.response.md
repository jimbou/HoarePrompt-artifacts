Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer in the range [1, n-1], `_` is 1, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', and `res` is assigned the value of the input, and the stdin now contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2`, and this is printed: '!', k (where k is an integer in the range [1, n-1]), best (where best is either n-1 or either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n-2)**
