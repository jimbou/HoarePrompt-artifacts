Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `_` is 2, `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`, `res` is the input from stdin, and stdin contains some input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 2. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `res`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k` which is either 1 or 2, followed by the value of `best` which is either 0, 1 or 2, followed by the value of `k` which is either 1 or 2, followed by the value of `i` which is 3**
