Based on the initial state, the print statement will print a string with several values.

- '?' is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- `0` is an integer that will be printed as is.
- `k` is an integer with a value of 1, which will be printed as 1.
- `0` is another integer that will be printed as is.
- `i` is an integer with a value of 2, which will be printed as 2.

The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the standard output, but it doesn't affect the content of the output.

Output: **? 0 1 0 2**
