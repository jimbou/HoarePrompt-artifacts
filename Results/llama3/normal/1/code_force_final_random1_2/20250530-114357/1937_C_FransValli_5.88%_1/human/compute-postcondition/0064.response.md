Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `_` is 1, `res` is the new input from stdin, `best` is an integer in the range [0, n-1], `k` is 4, and stdin is empty. If `res` is '<', then `k` is 4. Otherwise, `k` remains 4.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` is now 4, regardless of the value of `res`. The values of `n`, `i`, `_`, `res`, and `best` remain the same as before. The stdin is still empty.
