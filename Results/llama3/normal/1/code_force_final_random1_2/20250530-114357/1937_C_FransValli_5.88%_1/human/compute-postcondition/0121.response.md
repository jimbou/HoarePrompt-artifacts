Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `k` is either 1 or 2, depending on the value of `res`. Since `res` is either '<' or not, `k` will be 1 if `res` is '<', and 2 otherwise.
* `best` is 1 if `res` is '<', and 0 otherwise.
* `i` is 2.

Now, let's consider the print statement:

`print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)`

The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is printed immediately, without buffering.

The output will be a string that starts with '?' and is followed by the values of `k`, `best`, `k`, and `i`, separated by spaces.

Since `k` is either 1 or 2, and `best` is either 0 or 1, the possible outputs are:

* If `res` is '<', then `k` is 1 and `best` is 1: `? 1 1 1 2`
* If `res` is not '<', then `k` is 2 and `best` is 0: `? 2 0 2 2`

Therefore, the output will be one of these two possibilities.

Output: **? 1 1 1 2 (if res is '<') or ? 2 0 2 2 (if res is not '<')**
