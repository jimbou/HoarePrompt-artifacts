Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `_` is 2, `best` is either 0 or 1 or ... or n-2, `res` is '<', and stdin contains some input.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res` is still '<', which was assigned from the input from stdin. The input in stdin is still present, and the printed output remains the same: ? 0 1 0 2.
