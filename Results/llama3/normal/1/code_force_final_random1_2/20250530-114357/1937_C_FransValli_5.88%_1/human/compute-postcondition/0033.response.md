Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), `_` is 0, `res` is either '<' or '>', `best` is 0 or 1, stdin is empty, and the printed string is '? [k] [best] [k] [i]' where k is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), best is 0 or 1, and i is 2. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` is updated to either '<' or '>' based on the user input. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `best` is still either 0 or 1, and if `res` is '<', then `best` is 1. The printed string is in the format '? k best k i' where k is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), best is 0 or 1, and i is 2.
