Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, i is 0, k is 1, _ is 1, res is either '<' or '>', best is an integer in the range [0, n-1], stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin is empty, this line does not change the value of `n`. The second line assigns the value 1 to `k`, overwriting its previous value. No other variables are affected.
