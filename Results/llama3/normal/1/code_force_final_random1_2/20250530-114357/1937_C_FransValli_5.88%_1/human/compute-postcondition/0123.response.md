Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`, `best` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `res`, `res` is the input from stdin, and stdin contains some input.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the input from stdin, and the values of `k` and `best` are still dependent on the value of `res`. The other variables remain unchanged. The program has read an input from stdin and stored it in the variable `res`.
