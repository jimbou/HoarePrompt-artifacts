Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, `_` is 2, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', `best` is either 0 or 1 or ... or n-2, and stdin contains some input, and this is printed: ? 0 1 0 2, and `res` is assigned the value of the input from stdin.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is updated to be the input from stdin, which is one of the characters '<', '>', '=', '?', '!', or 'N'. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains some input, and the printed output is still '? 0 1 0 2'.
