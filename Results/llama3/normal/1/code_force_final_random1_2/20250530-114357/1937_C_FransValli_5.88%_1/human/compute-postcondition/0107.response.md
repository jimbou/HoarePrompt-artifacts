Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `_` is 2, `best` is either 0 or 1 or ... or n-3, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', and stdin contains some input, and this is printed: ? 0 1 0 3, and `res` is assigned the value of the input from stdin. If `res` is '<', then `k` is 2. Otherwise, `k` is 1, and this is printed: ? 0 [k] 0 [i], where k is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res` and i is 4.**
