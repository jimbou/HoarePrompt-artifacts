To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(2, n):`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.

The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
- `n` is an integer greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `k` is either 1 or 2
- `_` is 1
- `res` is either '<', '>', or the input from stdin
- `best` is an integer in the range [0, n-1]
- stdin is empty

Given this information, we can adjust the state for the next iteration as follows:

- `i` must be incremented to 3 for the loop to execute again.
- `n` remains greater than 2, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

The other variables (`k`, `_`, `res`, `best`, and stdin) are not directly affected by the loop head, so their states do not change based on the loop's continuation criteria.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is either 1 or 2, `_` is 1, `res` is either '<', '>', or the input from stdin, `best` is an integer in the range [0, n-1], and stdin is empty. If `res` is '<', then `k` is 2. Otherwise, `k` remains 1.**
