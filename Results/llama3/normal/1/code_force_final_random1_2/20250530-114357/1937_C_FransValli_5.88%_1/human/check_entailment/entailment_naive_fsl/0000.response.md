Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly implements the interactive algorithm to find two indices i and j such that p_i âŠ• p_j is maximized, using at most 3n queries.

The program first finds the index k of the maximum value in the sequence p by comparing each element with the current maximum (initially set to the first element). This is done using n-1 queries.

Then, it finds the index best of the minimum value in the sequence p by comparing each element with the current minimum (initially set to the first element) and the maximum value found earlier (k). This is done using n-1 queries.

Finally, it prints the pair of indices k and best, which maximizes the XOR operation.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where n=2, and does not exceed the limit of 3n queries. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
