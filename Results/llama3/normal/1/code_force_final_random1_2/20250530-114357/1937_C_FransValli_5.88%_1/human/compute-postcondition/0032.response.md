Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), `_` is 0, `res` is a string, `best` is 0 or 1, stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? [k] [best] [k] [i]. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 1. The print statement will output a string in the format '? k best k i' where k is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), best is 0 or 1, and i is 2.**
