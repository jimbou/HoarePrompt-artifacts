To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `_`, `k`, `res`, `best`, and `stdin` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `_` is 2, `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`, `res` is the input from stdin, and stdin contains some input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 2. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `res`.**
