Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), `_` is 0, `res` is either '<' or '>', `best` is 3, stdin is empty, and the printed string is '? [k] [best] [k] [i]' where k is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), best is 3, and i is 3. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 3. Otherwise, `best` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The printed string still contains the values of `k`, `best`, and `i`, but now `best` is 3. The conditional statement about `res` and `best` is still valid, but now `best` is always 3, regardless of the value of `res`.
