Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`, and stdin contains some input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 1 and `res` is '<'. Otherwise, `best` remains 0., and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k` (either 1 or 2), the value of `best` (either 0 or 1), the value of `k` again (either 1 or 2), and the value of `i` which is 2**
