The code prints a string that includes several variables: `k`, `best`, `k`, and `i`. The values of these variables are determined by the initial state.

*   `k` is an integer in the range [1, n-1].
*   `best` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 2. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1.
*   `k` is the same as the first `k`, an integer in the range [1, n-1].
*   `i` is 3.

The `flush=True` argument in the print function ensures that the output is displayed immediately.

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 3 (where k is an integer in the range [1, n-1] and best is either 0, 1, or 2)**
