Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, `k` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `res`, `_` is 0, `res` is a string that is either '<' or '? 0 1 0 2', stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 [k] 0 [i] where k is either 2 or 3 and i is 4. If `res` is '<', then `k` is 3. Otherwise, `k` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 4. The value of `i` remains 4. The value of `k` is still dependent on the value of `res`, which is now a string that can be either '<' or '? 0 1 0 2'. The value of `_` remains 0. The stdin is still empty. The printed statement remains the same, with `k` being either 2 or 3 and `i` being 4, depending on the value of `res`.
