The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 1), `n` becomes that integer. The second line assigns the value of 1 to `k`. The value of `_` is not affected by the code.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is 1, _ is 0, stdin is empty**
