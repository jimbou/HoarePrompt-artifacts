The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the integer input. If the integer input is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 1), so for the loop to be executed the integer input must be greater than 1 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 1), `_` is 0**
