Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 1).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            k = i
    best = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            best = i
    print('!', k, best, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `k` is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), `_` is 0, `res` is either '<' or '>', `best` is an integer in the range [0, `n-1`], stdin is empty, and this is printed: ! [k] [best] where k is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), best is an integer in the range [0, `n-1`]. If `res` is '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is an integer in the range [0, `n-2`].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer in the range [1, n-1], `_` is 1, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', and `res` is assigned the value of the input, and the stdin now contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2`, and this is printed: '!', k (where k is an integer in the range [1, n-1]), best (where best is either n-1 or either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n-2)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 2, `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`, and stdin contains some input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `res`, and this is printed: '!', k (where k is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`), best (where best is either `n-1`, 0 or 1 depending on the value of `res`)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
