Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), `_` is 0, `res` is either '<' or '>', `best` is 2, stdin is empty, and the printed string is '? [k] [best] [k] [i]' where k is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), best is 2, and i is 2. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The printed string still contains the same values for `k` and `i`, but the value of `best` has been updated to 2. Additionally, if `res` is '<', then `best` is now 2.
