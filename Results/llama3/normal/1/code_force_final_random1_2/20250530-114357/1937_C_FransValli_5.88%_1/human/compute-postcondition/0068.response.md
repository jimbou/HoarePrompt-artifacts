The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1. `n` is already greater than or equal to 2, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer in the range [1, n-1], `_` is 1, `res` is the input from stdin, and `best` is 0**
