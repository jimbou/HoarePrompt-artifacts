Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `k` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `res`, `_` is 0, `res` is either '<' or '? 0 1 0 2', stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 [k] 0 [i] where k is either 2 or 3 and i is 3. If `res` is '<', then `k` is 3. Otherwise, `k` is 2.***
