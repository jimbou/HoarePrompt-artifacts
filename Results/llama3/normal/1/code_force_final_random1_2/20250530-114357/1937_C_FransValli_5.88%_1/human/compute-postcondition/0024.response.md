Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects that will be printed.

The `print` statement is: `print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)`

Here's a breakdown of the values:

* `?`: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `k`: This is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`). Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` will be an integer greater than or equal to 2.
* `best`: This is an integer with a value of 0.
* `k`: This is the same value as the first `k`, the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`).
* `i`: This is an integer with a value of 1.

So, when the `print` statement is executed, the output will be:

Output: **? [k] 0 [k] 1 (where k is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, n))**

Note that the exact value of `k` cannot be determined without knowing the value of `n`, but we can describe its value in terms of the given condition.
