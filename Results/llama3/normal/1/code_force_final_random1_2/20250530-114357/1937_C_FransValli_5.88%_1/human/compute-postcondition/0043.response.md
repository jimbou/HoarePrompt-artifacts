The code prints an exclamation mark followed by the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), then the best integer in the range [0, `n-1`], and finally the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), with the flush parameter set to True to force the output buffer to be flushed.

Output: **! [k] [best] [k] (where k is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), and best is an integer in the range [0, `n-1`])**
