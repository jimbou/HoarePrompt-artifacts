The code `best = i` assigns the value of `i` to `best`. Since `i` is 2, `best` is now 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The value of `res` is still the input from stdin, and `k` is still either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 2, and `_` is still 2. Stdin still contains some input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`, `best` is 2, `res` is the input from stdin, and stdin contains some input.**
