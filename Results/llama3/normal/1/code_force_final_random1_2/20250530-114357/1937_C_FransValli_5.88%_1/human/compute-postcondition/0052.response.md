Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `_` is 1, `res` is '<', `best` is an integer in the range [0, n-1], and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin is still empty.
