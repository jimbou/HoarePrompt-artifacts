Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer in the range [1, n-1], `_` is 1, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', `best` is 3, and the stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res` is still one of the possible values, and the stdin is empty.
