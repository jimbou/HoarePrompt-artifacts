Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `k` is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), `_` is 0, `res` is either '<' or '>', `best` is an integer in the range [0, `n-1`], stdin is empty, and this is printed: ! [k] [best] where k is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), best is an integer in the range [0, `n-1`]. If `res` is '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is an integer in the range [0, `n-2`].**
