Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer in the range [1, n-1], `_` is 1, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', and `res` is assigned the value of the input, and the stdin now contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 3. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1, and this is printed: ? [k] [best] [k] [i]***
