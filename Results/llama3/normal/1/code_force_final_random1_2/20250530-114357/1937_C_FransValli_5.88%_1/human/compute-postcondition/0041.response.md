Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), `_` is 0, `res` is either '<' or '>', `best` is either 2 or 3, stdin is empty, and the printed string is '? [k] [best] [k] [i]' where k is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), best is either 2 or 3, and i is 3. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 3. Otherwise, `best` is 2.***
