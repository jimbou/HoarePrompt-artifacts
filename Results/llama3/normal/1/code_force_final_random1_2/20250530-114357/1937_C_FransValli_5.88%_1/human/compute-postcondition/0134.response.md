Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 2, `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`, and stdin contains some input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `res`, and this is printed: '!', k (where k is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`), best (where best is either `n-1`, 0 or 1 depending on the value of `res`)**
