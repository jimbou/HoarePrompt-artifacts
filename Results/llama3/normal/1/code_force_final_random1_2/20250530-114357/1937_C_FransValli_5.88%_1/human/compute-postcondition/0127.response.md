The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i`. 

`k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `k` is 2. Otherwise, `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`. 

`best` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 2. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `res`.

`i` is 3.

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] 3 (where k is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of res, and best is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the value of res)**
