Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), `_` is 0, `res` is a string, `best` is 0, stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? [k] [best] [k] [i]**.

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, but `res` is now assigned a string value from the input, and the stdin remains empty. The printed message remains the same as before.
