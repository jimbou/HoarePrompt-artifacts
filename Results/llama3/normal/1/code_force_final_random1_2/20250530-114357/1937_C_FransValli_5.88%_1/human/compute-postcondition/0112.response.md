Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 2, `best` is 0, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`, and stdin contains some input.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 0. The values of `n`, `_`, and `res` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` has been updated to `n-1`. The value of `k` depends on the value of `res`: if `res` is '<', then `k` is 2, otherwise `k` is 1. The stdin still contains some input.
