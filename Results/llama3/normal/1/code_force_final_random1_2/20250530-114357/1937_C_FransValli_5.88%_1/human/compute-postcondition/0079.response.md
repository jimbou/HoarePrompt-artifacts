The code `best = i` assigns the value of `i` to `best`. Since `i` is 2, `best` is now 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer in the range [1, n-1], `_` is 1, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', and `best` is 2.**
