Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `_` is 0, `res` is either '<' or '? 0 1 0 2', stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 [k] 0 [i] where k is 3 and i is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The print statement still displays ? 0 [k] 0 [i], but now k is 3, which is the same as the value of i.
