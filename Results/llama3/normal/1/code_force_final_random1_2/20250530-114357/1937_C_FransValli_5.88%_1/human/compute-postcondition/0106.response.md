The code prints a formatted string with the following elements: '?' (a literal question mark), 0 (a literal integer), k (either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`), 0 (a literal integer), and i (which is 4).

Since `res` is assigned the value of the input from stdin, which is '? 0 1 0 3', `res` will be '<'. Therefore, `k` will be 2.

Output: **? 0 2 0 4**
