Functionality: **This function reads an integer input from stdin, performs a series of comparisons and queries, and then prints the result in a specific format. It appears to be implementing a strategy for finding the maximum value in a list of integers, where the list is not directly accessible but can be queried through a comparison function. The function takes no explicit parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the result to stdout.**
