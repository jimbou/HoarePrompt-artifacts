Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, `best` is 1, `res` is a string equal to '<', `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`, and stdin contains some input.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `k` is still dependent on the value of `res`, which is still '<'. The input in stdin is still present.
