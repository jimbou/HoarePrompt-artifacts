Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer in the range [1, n-1], `_` is 1. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `_`, and `res` remain unchanged, and `best` remains 0. The following is printed: '?' followed by the value of `k` which is an integer in the range [1, n-1], followed by the value of `best` which is either 0 or 1, followed by the value of `k` again, and finally the value of `i` which is 2.**
