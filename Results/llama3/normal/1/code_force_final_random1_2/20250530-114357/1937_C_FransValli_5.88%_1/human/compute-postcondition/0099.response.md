The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is either 1 or 2, `_` is 2, `best` is either 0 or 1 or ... or n-2, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', and stdin contains some input, and this is printed: ? 0 1 0 2, and `res` is assigned the value of the input from stdin. If `res` is '<', then `k` is 2. Otherwise, `k` is 1.**
