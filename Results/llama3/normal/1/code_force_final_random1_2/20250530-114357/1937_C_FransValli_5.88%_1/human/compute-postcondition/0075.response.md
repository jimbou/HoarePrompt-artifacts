The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer in the range [1, n-1], `_` is 1. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `_`, and `res` remain unchanged, and `best` remains 0.**
