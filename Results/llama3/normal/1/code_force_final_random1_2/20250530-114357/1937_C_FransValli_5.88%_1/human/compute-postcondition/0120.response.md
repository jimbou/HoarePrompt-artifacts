The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`, and stdin contains some input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 1 and `res` is '<'. Otherwise, `best` remains 0.**
