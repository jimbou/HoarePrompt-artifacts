The only objects in the loop head are variable  _ and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input.  If the input is not empty the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, the input is empty. So for the loop to be executed one more time the input must not be empty.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer in the range [1, n-1], `_` is 2, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', and `res` is assigned the value of the input, and the stdin now contains some input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2**, and this is printed: '!', k (where k is an integer in the range [1, n-1]), best (where best is either n-1 or either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n-2)**
