Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`, `k` is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), `_` is 0, `res` is either '<' or '? 0 1 0 `n-1`', `best` is 0, stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 [k] 0 [i] where k is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`) and i is `n`. If `res` is '<', then `k` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `k` is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`).**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been initialized to 0, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The printed message and the conditions on `k` and `res` are still valid.
