To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is less than `n`. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is the smallest integer greater than 1 that is not less than any other integer in the range [2, `n`), `_` is 0, `res` is either '<' or '? 0 1 0 `n-1`', `best` is 0, stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 [k] 0 [i]**
