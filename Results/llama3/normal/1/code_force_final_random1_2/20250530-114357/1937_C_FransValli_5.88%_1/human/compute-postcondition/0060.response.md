The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `_` is 1, `res` is the input from stdin, `best` is an integer in the range [0, n-1], and stdin is empty. If `res` is '<', then `k` is 4. Otherwise, `k` remains 1 or 2.**
