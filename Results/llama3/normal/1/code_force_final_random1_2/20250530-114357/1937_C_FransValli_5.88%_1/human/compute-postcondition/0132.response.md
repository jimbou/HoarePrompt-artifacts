Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 2, `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`, and stdin contains some input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `res`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`, and the value of `best` will be `n-1` if the input `res` is '<', indicating that the best value found so far is the last value checked in the loop. If `res` is not '<', then `best` will be either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `res`. The values of `n`, `_`, `k`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
