The code prints a string that includes a question mark, the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i`. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is displayed immediately.

Output: **? [k] [best] [k] [i] (where k is an integer in the range [1, n-1], best is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of res, and i is 2)**
