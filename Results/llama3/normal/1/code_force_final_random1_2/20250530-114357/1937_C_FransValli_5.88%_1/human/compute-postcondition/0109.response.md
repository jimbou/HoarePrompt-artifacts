Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `_` is 2, `best` is either 0 or 1 or ... or n-3, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', `k` is 4, and stdin contains some input, and this is printed: ? 0 1 0 3, and this is printed: ? 0 [4] 0 [4]**.

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to 4, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The printed statements are still the same, but now the value of `k` in the second printed statement is 4, which is the same as the value of `i`.
