To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(2, n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the condition `i < n` is still satisfied, and the loop can execute again.

The other variables in the state (`k`, `_`, `res`, and `stdin`) are not affected by the loop head, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 2 if `res` is '<', otherwise `k` is 1, `_` is 0, `res` is either '<' or '? 0 1 0 2', stdin is empty**
