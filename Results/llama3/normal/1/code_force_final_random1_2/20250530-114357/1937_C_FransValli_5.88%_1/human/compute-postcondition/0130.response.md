Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `_` is 2, `res` is the input from stdin, `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`, and `best` is 3, and stdin contains some input.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains some input. The value of `k` still depends on the value of `res`, and the value of `res` is still the input from stdin.
