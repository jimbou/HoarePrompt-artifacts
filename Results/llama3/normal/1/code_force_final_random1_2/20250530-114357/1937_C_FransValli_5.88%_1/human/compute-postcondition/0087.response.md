Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer in the range [1, n-1], `_` is 1, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', and `res` is assigned the value of the input, and the stdin now contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute `n-1` times. After the loop finishes, the value of `i` will be `n`, and the value of `res` will be the last input from stdin. If the last input is '<', then `best` will be `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` will be the last value it was assigned during the loop, which can be any value from 0 to `n-2`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `_` remain unchanged.
