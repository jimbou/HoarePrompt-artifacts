Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer in the range [1, n-1], `_` is equal to the value of `n` minus 1, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', and `res` is assigned the value of the input, and the stdin now contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2`, and this is printed: '!', k (where k is an integer in the range [1, n-1]), best (where best is either n-1 or either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or n-2)**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables have been updated accordingly. The value of `n` remains the same, `i` is now equal to `n`, `k` is an integer in the range [1, n-1], and `_` is equal to the value of `n` minus 1. The value of `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', and it is assigned the value of the input. The stdin now contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2`. The loop has printed the final values of `k` and `best` in the format '!', k, best.
