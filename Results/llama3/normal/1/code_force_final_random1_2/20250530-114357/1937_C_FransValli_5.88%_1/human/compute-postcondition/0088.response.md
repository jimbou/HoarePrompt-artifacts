Based on the initial state, the print statement will print an exclamation mark (!), followed by the value of `k`, which is an integer in the range [1, n-1], and then the value of `best`.

The value of `best` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `best` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `best` is either 0 or 1 or 2 or ... or `n-2`.

Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n-1` is at least 1. Therefore, `best` is at least 1 when `res` is '<'.

When `res` is not '<', `best` can take any value from 0 to `n-2`, inclusive.

Output: **! [k] [best] (where k is an integer in the range [1, n-1] and best is either n-1 when res is '<' or a value from 0 to n-2 when res is not '<')**
