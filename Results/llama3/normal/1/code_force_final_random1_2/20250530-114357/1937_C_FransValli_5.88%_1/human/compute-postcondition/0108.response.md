Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `_` is 2, `best` is either 0 or 1 or ... or n-3, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`, and stdin contains some input, and this is printed: ? 0 1 0 3, and this is printed: ? 0 [k] 0 [i], where k is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res` and i is 4.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 4, `i` is still 4, and `_` is still 2. The value of `best` is still either 0 or 1 or ... or n-3. The value of `res` is now either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', which is the input from stdin. The value of `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`. The program has printed two lines: "? 0 1 0 3" and "? 0 [k] 0 [i]", where k is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res` and i is 4.
