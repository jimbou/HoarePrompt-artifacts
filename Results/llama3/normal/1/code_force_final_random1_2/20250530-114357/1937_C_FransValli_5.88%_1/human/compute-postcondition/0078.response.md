Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer in the range [1, n-1], `_` is 1, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N', and `best` is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `res` is updated to the input received from the user, which can be any of the characters '<', '>', '=', '?', '!', or 'N'. The value of `best` is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `best` is 1; otherwise, `best` remains 0.
