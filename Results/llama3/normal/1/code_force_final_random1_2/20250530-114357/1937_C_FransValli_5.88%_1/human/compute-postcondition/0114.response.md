The code prints a string that includes a question mark, the value of `k`, the value of `best`, the value of `k` again, and the value of `i`. 

The value of `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `res`. The value of `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or 'N'. The value of `best` is 0. The value of `i` is 1.

Output: **? (question mark), [k] (where k is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of res), 0 (the value of best), [k] (where k is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of res), 1 (the value of i)**
