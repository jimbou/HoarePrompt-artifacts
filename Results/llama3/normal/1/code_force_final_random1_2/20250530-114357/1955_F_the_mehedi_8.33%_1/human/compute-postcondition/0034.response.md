Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `a`, `cnt` is `math.floor(x / 2) + 1 + math.floor(x / 2)` if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, otherwise `cnt` is `math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `a` still has at least 2 elements and `x` is still the second element of `a`. The value of `cnt` has been increased by `math.floor(x / 2)`. If the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, `cnt` is now the sum of `math.floor(x / 2) + 1` and `math.floor(x / 2)`, otherwise, it is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` and `math.floor(x / 2)`.
