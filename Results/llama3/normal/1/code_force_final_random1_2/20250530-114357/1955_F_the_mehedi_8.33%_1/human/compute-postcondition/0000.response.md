According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `_` is 0,  `input()` must be greater than 0**
