Output State: **a is a list of integers, cnt is 0**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. Since `a` was initially a list with at least three elements, and `x` was the last element of `a`, the new list of integers from stdin replaces the original list in `a`. The second line initializes `cnt` to 0. Since `cnt` was not printed, its initial value is irrelevant, and it is now set to 0.

The final state includes the updated value of `a` as a list of integers from stdin, and `cnt` is set to 0. The value of `x` is no longer relevant as it was the last element of the original list `a`, which has been replaced. Stdin is now empty as it has been read to populate the list `a`.
