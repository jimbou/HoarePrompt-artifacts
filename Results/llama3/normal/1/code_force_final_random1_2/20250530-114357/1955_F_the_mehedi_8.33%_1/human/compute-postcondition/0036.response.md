Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `a`, if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, then `cnt` is `math.floor(x / 2) + 1 + math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2)`, otherwise `cnt` is `math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2)`**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its previous value. The conditions for the first three elements of `a` being equal and odd, or not, still apply to determine the exact value of `cnt`. The values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged.
