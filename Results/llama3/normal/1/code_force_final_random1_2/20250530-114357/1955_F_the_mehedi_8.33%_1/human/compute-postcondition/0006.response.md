Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `a` is a list of four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200) that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `a`, `cnt` is either 1 plus the integer division of `a[0]` by 2 if `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are equal and `a[0]` is an odd number, or remains unchanged**.

In natural language, the output state is: The input `stdin` still contains t-1 lines of four integers each. The list `a` remains the same with four integers, and `x` is still the first element of `a`. The value of `cnt` has changed. If the first three elements of `a` are equal and the first element is an odd number, then `cnt` is incremented by the integer division of the first element of `a` by 2. Otherwise, `cnt` remains the same.
