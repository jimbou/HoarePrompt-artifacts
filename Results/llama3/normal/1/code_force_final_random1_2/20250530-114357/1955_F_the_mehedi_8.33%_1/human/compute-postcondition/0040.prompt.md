Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
        cnt += 1
    for x in a:
        cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: cnt is either 1 plus the integer division of `a[0]` by 2 if `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are equal and `a[0]` is an odd number, or remains unchanged, and `cnt` is increased by the integer division of each element in `a` by 2, and the value of cnt is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cnt is the sum of the integer division of each element in a by 2 plus the integer division of the first element of a by 2 plus the integer division of the second element of a by 2 plus the integer division of the third element of a by 2, a is a list with at least three elements, x is the last element of a, and cnt is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements in `a` plus 1 if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, otherwise `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements in `a`, and the value of `cnt` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
