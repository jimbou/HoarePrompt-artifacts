Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `a` is a list of four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200) that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `a`, `cnt` is either 1 plus the integer division of `a[0]` by 2 if `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are equal and `a[0]` is an odd number, or remains unchanged, and `cnt` is increased by the integer division of `x` by 2**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding the integer division of `x` by 2 to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). The list `a` still has at least 3 elements, and `x` is still the third element of `a`.
