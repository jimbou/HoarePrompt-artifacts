Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input from the standard input, which contains an integer `t` followed by `t` lines, each containing four integers `p_i`.
2.  For each line, the program calculates the count `cnt` by summing the integer division of each number by 2. This is correct because the integer division `x // 2` gives the number of pairs of `x` that can be formed, and since XOR of two identical numbers is 0, each pair contributes to Bob's win.
3.  The program also checks if the first three numbers are equal and odd. If they are, it increments the count by 1. This is correct because if the first three numbers are equal and odd, it means that there is an odd number of 1's, 2's, and 3's in the sequence. In this case, Eve can remove one number to make the XOR of the remaining numbers 0, resulting in Bob's win.
4.  Finally, the program prints the calculated count for each line, which represents the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
