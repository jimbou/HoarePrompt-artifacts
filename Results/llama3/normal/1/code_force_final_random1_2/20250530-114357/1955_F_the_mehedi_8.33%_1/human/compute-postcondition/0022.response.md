The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, x is the second element of a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the x is the third element of a.
State: **`cnt` is the sum of the integer division of each element in `a` by 2 plus the integer division of the first element of `a` by 2 plus the integer division of the second element of `a` by 2, `a` is a list with at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `a`**
