Output State: **`cnt` is the sum of the integer division of each element in `a` by 2 plus 1, `a` is a list of integers from stdin**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1 from its initial value, which was the sum of the integer division of each element in `a` by 2. The value of `a` remains the same, as it is a list of integers from stdin. The stdin is still empty, as it was in the initial state.
