Output: **`a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last element of `a`, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements in `a` plus 1 if the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, otherwise `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements in `a`, and the value of `cnt` is being printed**
