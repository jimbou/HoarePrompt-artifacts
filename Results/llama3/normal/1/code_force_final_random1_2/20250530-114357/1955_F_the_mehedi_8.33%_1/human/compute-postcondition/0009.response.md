The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, x is the second element of a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the x is the third element of a.
State: **`stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), `a` is a list of four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200) that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `a`, `cnt` is either 1 plus the integer division of `a[0]` by 2 if `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are equal and `a[0]` is an odd number, or remains unchanged, and `cnt` is increased by the integer division of `x` by 2**
