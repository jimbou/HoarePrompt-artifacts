Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `a` is a list of four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), where `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are equal and `a[0]` is an odd number, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so `a` is still a list of four integers, where the first three elements are equal and the first element is an odd number. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers.
