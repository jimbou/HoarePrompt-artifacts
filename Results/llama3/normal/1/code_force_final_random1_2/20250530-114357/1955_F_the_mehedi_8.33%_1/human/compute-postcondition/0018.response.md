To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `x` and the list `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if the list `a` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to ensure it has at least one element.

Additionally, since `x` is the loop variable, we need to adjust its state to reflect the first element of the list `a`.

The state of `cnt` is not directly related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust it. However, we can infer that the value of `cnt` is calculated based on the elements of `a`, so we can assume that the value of `cnt` is consistent with the state of `a`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`cnt` is the sum of the integer division of each element in `a` by 2, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the first element of `a`**
