Output State: **stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), a is a list of four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), cnt is 0**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and assigns them to the list `a`. Since `input()` must be greater than 0, the first integer in the line is greater than 0. The variable `_` is not used in the code, so its value remains 0. The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged throughout the code. The state of stdin is updated to contain t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200).
