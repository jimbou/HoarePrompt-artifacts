Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `test` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year`, `n` is the first element in the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`. `current_year` is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `current_year` has been updated to either the next multiple of `ai` if it was already a multiple, or the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
