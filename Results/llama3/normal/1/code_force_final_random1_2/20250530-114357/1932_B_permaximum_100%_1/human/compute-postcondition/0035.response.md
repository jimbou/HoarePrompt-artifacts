Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `test` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year`, `n` is the first element in the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`. If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, then `next_year` is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.***
