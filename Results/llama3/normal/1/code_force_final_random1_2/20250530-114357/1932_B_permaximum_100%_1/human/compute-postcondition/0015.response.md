The only object in the loop head is variable  ai and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, ai is the second element in a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the ai is the third element in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.**
