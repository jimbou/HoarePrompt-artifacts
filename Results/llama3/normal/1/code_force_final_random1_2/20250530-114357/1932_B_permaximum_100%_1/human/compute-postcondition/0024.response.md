Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, test is the second test case in the list, results is a list containing the updated current_year, n is the first element in the second test case in test_cases, a is the second element in the second test case in test_cases, ai is the last element in a, current_year is 0.**

The code first assigns the values of `n` and `a` from the second test case in `test_cases` to the variables `n` and `a`, respectively. Then, it sets the value of `current_year` to 0. The value of `t`, `test_cases`, `test`, and `results` remain unchanged. The value of `ai` is also updated to be the last element in the new list `a`.
