Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `test` is not defined, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of all elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to 0 for each test case in `test_cases`, `n` is not defined, `a` is not defined, `ai` is not defined, `current_year` is not defined.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the `test_cases` list will be empty because all test cases will have been processed. The `test` variable will not be defined because there are no more test cases to process. The `results` list will contain the smallest multiple of all elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to 0 for each test case in `test_cases`. The `n`, `a`, `ai`, and `current_year` variables will not be defined because they are only defined within the scope of the loop.
