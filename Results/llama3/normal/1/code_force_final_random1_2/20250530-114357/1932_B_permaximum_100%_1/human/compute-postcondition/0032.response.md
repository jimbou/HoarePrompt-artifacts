To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for ai in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `ai` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, and `ai` is the first element in `a`. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `ai` must be the second element in `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `test` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year`, `n` is the first element in the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, `current_year` is either `next_year` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.**
