Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `test` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year` and the smallest multiple of all elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the first element in the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the second test case in `test_cases` and is empty, `ai` is not defined, `current_year` is the smallest multiple of all elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `results` has been updated to include the smallest multiple of all elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to 0, which is the current year. The other variables remain unchanged.
