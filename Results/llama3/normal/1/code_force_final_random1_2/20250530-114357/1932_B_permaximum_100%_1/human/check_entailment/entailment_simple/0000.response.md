Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it iterates over the periodicities of the signs. It calculates the next year in which each sign will occur, taking into account the current year and the periodicity of the sign. The program then appends the final year to the results list.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly calculates the next year in which each sign will occur, and it correctly handles the case where the current year is already a multiple of the sign's periodicity. The program also correctly returns the final year for each test case.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code. The function is called with the arguments `t` and `test_cases`, but its definition is not provided. This would cause a `NameError` when the program is run.

Assuming that the function `func_1` is defined elsewhere in the code and its definition is correct, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
