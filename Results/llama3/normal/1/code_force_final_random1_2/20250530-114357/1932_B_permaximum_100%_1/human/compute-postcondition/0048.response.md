Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `test` is the third test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year` and the smallest multiple of all elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the first element in the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the third test case in `test_cases` that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, `next_year` is `current_year` plus `ai`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `next_year` is calculated by adding `ai` to `current_year`. The value of `current_year` is still a multiple of `ai`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
