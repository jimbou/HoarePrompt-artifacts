The only variable in the loop head is variable  test and test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the test_cases has at least 2 test cases the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 1 test case, test is the first test case in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the test_cases must have at least 2 test cases and the test is the second test case in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `test` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the last element in `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai` or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year` otherwise.**
