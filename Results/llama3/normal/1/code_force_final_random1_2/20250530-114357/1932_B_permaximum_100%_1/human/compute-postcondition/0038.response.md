Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `test` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year`, `n` is the first element in the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, `next_year` is `current_year + ai`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test`, `n`, `a`, and `ai` remain unchanged. The value of `results` is updated to contain the new `current_year`, which is now `current_year + ai`. A new variable `next_year` is introduced, which is equal to `current_year + ai`.
