#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of positive integers, where the first element of each inner list is a positive integer n, and the rest of the elements are n positive integers.

    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `test` is not defined, `results` is a list containing the smallest multiple of all elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to 0 for each test case in `test_cases`, `n` is not defined, `a` is not defined, `ai` is not defined, `current_year` is not defined.
    return results
    #The program returns a list containing the smallest multiple of all elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to 0 for each test case in `test_cases`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the smallest multiple of all elements in a list that is greater than or equal to 0 for each test case in a given list of test cases. It takes a list of test cases, where each test case contains a positive integer n and n positive integers, and returns a list of the smallest multiples for each test case. The function iterates through each test case, calculates the smallest multiple of all elements in the list, and appends it to the results list. The function returns the list of results.
