Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `test` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year`, `n` is the first element in the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, `current_year` is either `next_year` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`, `next_year` is `current_year + ai`.**

In this output state, the value of `next_year` has been updated to be the sum of `current_year` and `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `current_year` is still dependent on whether it is a multiple of `ai` or not, and its value is either `next_year` if it is a multiple of `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
