Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `current_year` is updated to be equal to `next_year`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `next_year` is either the sum of the old `current_year` and `ai` if the old `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than the old `current_year`.
