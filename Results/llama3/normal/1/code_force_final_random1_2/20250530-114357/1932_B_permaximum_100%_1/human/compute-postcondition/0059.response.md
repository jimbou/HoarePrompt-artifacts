Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `test` is the third test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year` and the smallest multiple of all elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the first element in the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the third test case in `test_cases` that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, `next_year` is `current_year` plus `ai`.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for `next_year`, which is now assigned the value of `current_year` plus `ai`. The value of `current_year` is not explicitly given, but it is part of the `results` list. The `next_year` variable is a new addition to the state, representing the result of adding `ai` (the third element of `a`) to `current_year`.
