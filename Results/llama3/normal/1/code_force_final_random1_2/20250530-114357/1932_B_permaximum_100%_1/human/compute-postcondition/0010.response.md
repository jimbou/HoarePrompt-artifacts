State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, `current_year` is equal to `(k + 1) * ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.**
