Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, test is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, a is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, ai is the first element in a. If current_year is a multiple of ai, then next_year is (k + 1) * ai, where k is a positive integer. Otherwise, next_year is the smallest multiple of ai that is greater than current_year.***
