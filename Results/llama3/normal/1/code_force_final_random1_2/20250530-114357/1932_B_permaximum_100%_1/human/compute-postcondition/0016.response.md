Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is `current_year + ai`**.

In this output state, the value of `next_year` has been updated to be equal to `current_year + ai`, where `ai` is the third element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
