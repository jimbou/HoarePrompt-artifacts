The only variable in the loop head is variable `ai` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `a` must have at least 3 elements and `ai` is the third element in `a`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `test` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year`, `n` is the first element in the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`.**
