Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The program iterates through each test case, calculates the smallest multiple of all elements in the list that is greater than or equal to the current year, and updates the current year accordingly. The program returns a list of the smallest multiples for each test case, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

The program correctly handles the case where the current year is already a multiple of the current sign's periodicity, in which case it simply adds the periodicity to the current year. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest multiple of the periodicity that is greater than the current year by dividing the current year by the periodicity, rounding up to the nearest integer, and multiplying by the periodicity.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input list contains duplicate elements, as the calculation of the smallest multiple is independent of the order of the elements in the list.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
