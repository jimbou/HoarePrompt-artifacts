Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `current_year` is equal to `(k + 1) * ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.**

In this output state, the value of `current_year` has been updated to be equal to `next_year`, which is either `(k + 1) * ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` otherwise. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
