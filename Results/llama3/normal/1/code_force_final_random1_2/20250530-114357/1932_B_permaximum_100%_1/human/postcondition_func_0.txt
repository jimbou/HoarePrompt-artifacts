This function calculates the smallest multiple of all elements in a list that is greater than or equal to 0 for each test case in a given list of test cases. It takes a list of test cases, where each test case contains a positive integer n and n positive integers, and returns a list of the smallest multiples for each test case. The function iterates through each test case, calculates the smallest multiple of all elements in the list, and appends it to the results list. The function returns the list of results.
