The only objects in the loop head are variables  ai and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable a. If a is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, a is a positive integer. So for the loop to be executed  the variable a must have at least 1 element and ai is the first element in a.
State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, test is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, a is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, current_year is 0, ai is the first element in a**
