Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of signs and calculates the year when each sign will occur, taking into account the periodicity of each sign. The program correctly handles the case where the current year is already a multiple of the sign's periodicity, and also handles the case where the current year is not a multiple of the sign's periodicity.

The program uses the formula `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` to calculate the next year when the sign will occur, which is correct. This formula works by dividing the current year by the sign's periodicity, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by the sign's periodicity to get the next year when the sign will occur.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all the examples provided, and it seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
