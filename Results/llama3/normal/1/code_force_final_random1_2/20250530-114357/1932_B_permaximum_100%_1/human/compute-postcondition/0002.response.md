The code snippet assigns the values of `n` and `a` from the first test case in the `test_cases` list to the variables `n` and `a`, respectively. It also initializes a new variable `current_year` to 0. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, test is the first test case in the list, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, current_year is 0**
