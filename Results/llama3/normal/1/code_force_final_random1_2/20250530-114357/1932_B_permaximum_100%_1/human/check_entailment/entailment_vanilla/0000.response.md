Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of signs, and the periodicities of the signs as input.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and storing it in the variable `t`.
2.  It then reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a` for each test case and stores them in the `test_cases` list.
3.  The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the number of test cases `t` and the `test_cases` list as input.
4.  Inside the `func_1` function, it iterates over each test case and initializes the `current_year` to 0.
5.  For each sign in the test case, it checks if the `current_year` is a multiple of the sign's periodicity `ai`. If it is, it sets the `next_year` to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, it calculates the `next_year` as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, which is the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`.
6.  It then updates the `current_year` to `next_year`.
7.  After processing all signs in the test case, it appends the final `current_year` to the `results` list.
8.  Finally, it returns the `results` list, which contains the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
