Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `current_year` is not a multiple of the first element in `a` (`ai`), `ai` is the first element in `a`, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `current_year`, and `ai` remain unchanged. A new variable `next_year` is introduced, which is the smallest multiple of the first element in `a` (`ai`) that is greater than `current_year`.
