The only variable in the loop head is `ai` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ai` is the last element in `a`, so for the loop to execute, `ai` must be the first element in `a`. Also, `a` must have at least 1 element.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `test` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year`, `n` is the first element in the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `current_year` is 0**
