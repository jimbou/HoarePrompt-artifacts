The only object in the loop head is variable  ai and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list a has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 elements, ai is the second element in a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list a must have at least 3 elements and ai is the third element in a.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `test` is the third test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year` and the smallest multiple of all elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the first element in the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the third test case in `test_cases` that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`.**
