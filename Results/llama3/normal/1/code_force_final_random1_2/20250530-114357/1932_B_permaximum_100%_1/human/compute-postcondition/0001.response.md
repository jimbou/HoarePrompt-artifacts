The only variable in the loop head is `test` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers, and `results` is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed, `test_cases` must have at least 1 test case and `test` is the first test case in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list**
