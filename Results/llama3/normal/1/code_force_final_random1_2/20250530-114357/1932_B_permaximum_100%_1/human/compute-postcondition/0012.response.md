Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, `current_year` is equal to `(k + 1) * ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `test`, `results`, `n`, `a`, and `ai` remain unchanged. The value of `current_year` is still determined by its relationship with `ai` and `k`. A new variable `next_year` is introduced, which is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
