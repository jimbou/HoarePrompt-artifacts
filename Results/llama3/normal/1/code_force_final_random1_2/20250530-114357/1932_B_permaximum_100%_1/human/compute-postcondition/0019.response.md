Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai` or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year` otherwise.**

In this output state, the value of `current_year` has been updated to be equal to `next_year`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `next_year` is determined based on whether `current_year` is a multiple of `ai` or not. If it is a multiple, `next_year` is `current_year + ai`, otherwise it is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`.
