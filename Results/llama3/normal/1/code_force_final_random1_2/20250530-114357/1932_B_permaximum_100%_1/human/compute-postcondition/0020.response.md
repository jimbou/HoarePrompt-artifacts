Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the last element in `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai` or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year` otherwise.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `ai` will be the last element in the list `a`, and the variable `current_year` will be the result of the last iteration of the loop, which is either the current year plus the last element in `a` if the current year is a multiple of the last element in `a`, or the smallest multiple of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the current year otherwise. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
