Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the last element in `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year` which is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is a multiple of `ai` or the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year` otherwise.**

In natural language, the output state after the code executes is that the variable `results` now contains the updated `current_year` which has been appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
