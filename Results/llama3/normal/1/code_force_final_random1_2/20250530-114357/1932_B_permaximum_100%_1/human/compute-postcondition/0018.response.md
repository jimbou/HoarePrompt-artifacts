Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`. If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, `next_year` is `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`.***
