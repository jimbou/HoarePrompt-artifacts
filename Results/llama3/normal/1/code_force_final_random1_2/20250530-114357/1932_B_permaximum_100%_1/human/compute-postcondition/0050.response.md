Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `test` is the third test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year` and the smallest multiple of all elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the first element in the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the third test case in `test_cases` that must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`.**

In this output state, the value of `next_year` is calculated by finding the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`. This is done by dividing `current_year` by `ai`, rounding down to the nearest whole number, adding 1, and then multiplying by `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged.
