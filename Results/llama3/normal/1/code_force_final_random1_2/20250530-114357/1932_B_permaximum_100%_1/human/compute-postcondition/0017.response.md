Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`, `current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`.**

In this output state, the value of `next_year` has been updated to be the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`. This is because the expression `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` calculates the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.
