Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `test` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year`, `n` is the first element in the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`, and `current_year` is not divisible by `ai`**

In this output state, the value of `next_year` is calculated by finding the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. This is done by dividing `current_year` by `ai`, rounding down to the nearest integer, adding 1, and then multiplying by `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged.
