The code `next_year = current_year + ai` assigns the value of `current_year + ai` to `next_year`. Since `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, we can express `current_year` as `k * ai`, where `k` is a positive integer. Therefore, `next_year` is assigned the value `k * ai + ai`, which simplifies to `(k + 1) * ai`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 1 test case, `test` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, `ai` is the first element in `a`, and `next_year` is `(k + 1) * ai`, where `k` is a positive integer.**
