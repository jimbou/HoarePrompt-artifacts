Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it iterates through the list of signs. For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, taking into account the fact that the signs must occur sequentially. The program then returns a list of the years in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the edge cases. For example, if the current year is already a multiple of the sign's periodicity, the program correctly calculates the next year as the current year plus the periodicity. If the current year is not a multiple of the sign's periodicity, the program correctly calculates the next year as the smallest multiple of the periodicity that is greater than the current year.

The program's implementation is also efficient, with a time complexity of O(t \* n), where t is the number of test cases and n is the number of signs in each test case. This is because the program iterates through each test case and each sign in the test case once.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
