Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `test` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year`, `n` is the first element in the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `next_year` is `current_year` plus `ai`, and `current_year` is a multiple of `ai` and also `next_year` is a multiple of `ai`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `next_year` is the sum of `current_year` and `ai`. The value of `current_year` is still a multiple of `ai`, and `next_year` is also a multiple of `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged.
