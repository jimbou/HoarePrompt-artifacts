Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 2 test cases, `test` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year`, `n` is the first element in the second test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the second test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `next_year` is updated to be the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.
