Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of positive integers that must have at least 3 test cases, `test` is the third test case in the list, `results` is a list containing the updated `current_year` and the smallest multiple of all elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is the first element in the third test case in `test_cases`, `a` is the second element in the third test case in `test_cases` that must have at least 3 elements, `ai` is the third element in `a`. If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, then `next_year` is `current_year` plus `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`.**
