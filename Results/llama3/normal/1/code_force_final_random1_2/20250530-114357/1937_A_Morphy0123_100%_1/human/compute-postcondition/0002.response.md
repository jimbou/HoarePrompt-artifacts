Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the value of `n_cases` remains the same, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The value of `i` is still 0. The value of `n` is now an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), which is the input from the first line of stdin. The stdin now contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9), since one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
