Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `power` is 4, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^9)**

The code increments the value of `power` by 1, so its new value is 4. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, as well as the contents of `stdin`.
