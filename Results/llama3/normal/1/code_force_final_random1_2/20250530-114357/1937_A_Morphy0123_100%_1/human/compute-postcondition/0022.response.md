Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `power`, `power` is either equal to `n` or `n-1`, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^9). If `power` equals `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is being printed. Otherwise, the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed.***
