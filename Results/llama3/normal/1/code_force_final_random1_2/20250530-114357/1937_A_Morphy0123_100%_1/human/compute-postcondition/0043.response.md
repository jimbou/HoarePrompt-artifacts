Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original value, `power` is either equal to `n` or decreased by 1, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), and 2 raised to the power of either `n` or `power` is being printed, depending on whether `power` is equal to `n` or not.***
