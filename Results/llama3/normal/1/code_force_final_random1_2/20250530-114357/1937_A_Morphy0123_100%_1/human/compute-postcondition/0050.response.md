To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition: `while power < n:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `power` is less than `n`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive)
- `i` is 2
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original value
- `power` is 1
- `stdin` contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9)

We need to adjust the states of `power` and `n` since they are the variables in the loop head.

- `power` is 1, which is a constant value.
- `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original value. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `power` (which is 1).

Since `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original value, for `n` to be greater than 1, the original value of `n` must be greater than 2 (because 2^1 = 2, and we need a value that, when its base-2 logarithm is taken, results in a number greater than 1).

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is the original value of `n`, which must be greater than 2 for `n` (the base-2 logarithm of its original value) to be greater than 1, thus ensuring the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, the original value of `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9)**
