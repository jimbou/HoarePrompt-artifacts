The value of `power` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `power` is 1, so the new value of `power` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^9). The output state is: `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `power` is 2, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^9).
Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `power` is 2, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^9)**
