Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is `n_cases`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains 0 lines. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `power` is either equal to `n` or `n-1`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is updated to its base-2 logarithm, `power` is either equal to `n` or decreased by 1, and 2 raised to the power of either `n` or `power` is being printed, depending on whether `power` is equal to `n` or not, and 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is being printed. Otherwise, `power` is decreased by 1 and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has finished executing all iterations. The value of `n_cases` is between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), indicating that all cases have been processed. The value of `i` is equal to `n_cases`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), indicating that the last input value has been processed. The stdin contains 0 lines, indicating that all input values have been processed. The output state also describes the possible values of `power` and the corresponding output values, which depend on the value of `n`.
