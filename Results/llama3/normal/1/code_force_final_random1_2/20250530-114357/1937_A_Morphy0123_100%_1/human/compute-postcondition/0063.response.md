Output: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, the original value of `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `power` is not equal to `n` and is decreased by 1, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed**
