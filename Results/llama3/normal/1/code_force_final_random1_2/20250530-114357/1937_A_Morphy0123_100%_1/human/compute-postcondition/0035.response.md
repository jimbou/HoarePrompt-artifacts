Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original value, `power` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `power` has reached the value of `n`, which is the base-2 logarithm of its original value. This means that the loop has iterated until `power` is equal to `n`, at which point the loop condition `power < n` is no longer true, and the loop terminates. The other variables, `n_cases`, `i`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
