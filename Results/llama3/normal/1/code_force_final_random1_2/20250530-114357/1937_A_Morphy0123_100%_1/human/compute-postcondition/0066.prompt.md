Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases` lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n_cases):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        power = 1
        n = log2(n)
        while power < n:
            power += 1
        if power == n:
            print(2 ** power)
        else:
            power -= 1
            print(2 ** power)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `power` is either equal to `n` or `n-1`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 3` lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `power` is either equal to `n` or `n-1`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is updated to its base-2 logarithm, `power` is either equal to `n` or decreased by 1, and 2 raised to the power of either `n` or `power` is being printed, depending on whether `power` is equal to `n` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `power` is either equal to `n` or `n-1`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is updated to its base-2 logarithm, `power` is either equal to `n` or decreased by 1, and 2 raised to the power of either `n` or `power` is being printed, depending on whether `power` is equal to `n` or not, and 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is being printed. Otherwise, `power` is decreased by 1 and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
