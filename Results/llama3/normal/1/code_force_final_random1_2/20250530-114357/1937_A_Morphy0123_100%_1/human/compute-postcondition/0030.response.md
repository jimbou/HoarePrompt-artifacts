Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of an original value greater than 2, `power` is 2, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9)**

The code increments the value of `power` by 1. The initial value of `power` was 1, so after the increment, `power` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n_cases` is still between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is still 1, and `n` is still the base-2 logarithm of an original value greater than 2. The stdin still contains `n_cases` - 3 lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9).
