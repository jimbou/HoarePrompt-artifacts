The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n_cases`. If `i` is less than `n_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n_cases` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 2` lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `power` is either equal to `n` or `n-1`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed.**
