The value of `power` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `power` was 2, so the new value of `power` is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `power` is 3, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9).

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `power` is 3, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9).**
