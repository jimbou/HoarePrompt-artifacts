Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `power` is 4, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a new value of 4. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n_cases` - 3 lines, each containing an integer `n` within the specified range.
