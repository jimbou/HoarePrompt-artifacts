The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n_cases`. If n_cases is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n_cases is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases` lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n_cases` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases` lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9), `i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0**
