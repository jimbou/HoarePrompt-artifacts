The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is equal to `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^9 (inclusive) and is read from the standard input `stdin`, the exact value of `n` is not known. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`.

Output: **2^n (where n is an integer between 2 and 10^9, read from stdin)**
