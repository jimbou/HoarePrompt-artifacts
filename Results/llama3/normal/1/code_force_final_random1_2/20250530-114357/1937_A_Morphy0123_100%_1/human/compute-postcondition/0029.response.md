To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `power` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `power` is less than `n`. Right before the loop, `power` is 1, and `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original value.

Since `power` is 1, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. As `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original value, we can say that the original value of `n` must be greater than 2 (since 2^1 = 2, and we need `n` to be greater than 1).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of an original value greater than 2, `power` is 1, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9)**
