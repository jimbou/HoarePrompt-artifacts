According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. `n` being greater than 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, the original value of `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 2, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), `n` is greater than 2**
