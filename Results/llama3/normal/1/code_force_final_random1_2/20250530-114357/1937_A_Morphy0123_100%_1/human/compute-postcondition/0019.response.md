Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `power - 1`, `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is decreased by 1, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^9)**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of cases is still between 1 and 10,000, the counter `i` remains at 0, the value of `n` is still greater than or equal to the decreased power, and the power is not equal to `n`. The power has been decreased by 1. The standard input still contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each with an integer `n` between 2 and 10^9.
