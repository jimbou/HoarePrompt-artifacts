This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of cases to follow. For each case, it reads an integer n and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n. If n is 1, it simply prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the base-2 logarithm of n and prints 2 raised to the power of either the logarithm or the logarithm minus 1, depending on which is less than or equal to n. The function continues this process until all cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
