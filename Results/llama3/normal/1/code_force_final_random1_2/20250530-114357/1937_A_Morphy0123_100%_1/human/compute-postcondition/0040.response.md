Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is the base-2 logarithm of its original value, `power` is not equal to `n` and is decreased by 1, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been decreased by 1, but it is still not equal to `n`. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The `stdin` still contains `n_cases` - 3 lines, each containing an integer `n` within the specified range.
