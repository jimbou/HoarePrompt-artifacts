Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 3, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^9)**

The code increments the value of `power` by 1, so its new value is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n_cases` is still between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is still 0, and `n` is still greater than 2. The `stdin` still contains `n_cases - 1` lines, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^9).
