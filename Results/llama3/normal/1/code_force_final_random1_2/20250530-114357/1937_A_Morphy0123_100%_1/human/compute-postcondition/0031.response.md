The variables in the loop head are power and n, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables power and n. If power is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, power is 2, n is the base-2 logarithm of an original value greater than 2. Since power is 2, n must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `power` is 2, `stdin` contains `n_cases` - 3 lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9)**
