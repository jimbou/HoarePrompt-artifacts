Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, the original value of `n` must be greater than 3, `power` is 4, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9)**

The value of `power` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 4. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9).
