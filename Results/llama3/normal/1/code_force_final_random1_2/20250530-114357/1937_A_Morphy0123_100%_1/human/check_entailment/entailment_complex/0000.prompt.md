Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) â€”
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

# Annotated Program:
from math import log2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9).
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: `n_cases` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is `n_cases`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains 0 lines. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `power` is either equal to `n` or `n-1`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is updated to its base-2 logarithm, `power` is either equal to `n` or decreased by 1, and 2 raised to the power of either `n` or `power` is being printed, depending on whether `power` is equal to `n` or not, and 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is being printed. Otherwise, `power` is decreased by 1 and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of cases to follow. For each case, it reads an integer n and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n. If n is 1, it simply prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the base-2 logarithm of n and prints 2 raised to the power of either the logarithm or the logarithm minus 1, depending on which is less than or equal to n. The function continues this process until all cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
