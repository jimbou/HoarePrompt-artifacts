Output State: **n_cases is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, n is an integer between 0 and 30 (inclusive), power is 1, stdin contains n_cases - 1 lines, each containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^9)**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value 1 to the variable `power`. The second line calculates the base-2 logarithm of the value of `n` and assigns the result back to `n`. Since `n` was initially an integer between 2 and 10^9 (inclusive), the logarithm will be an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive). The value of `power` is not affected by the second line. The values of `n_cases` and `i` are not modified by the code. Stdin remains unchanged as it is not accessed or modified by the code.
