Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, the original value of `n` was greater than or equal to 2, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9). If `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is being printed. Otherwise, `power` is decreased by 1 and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed.***
