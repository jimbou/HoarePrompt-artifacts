Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, the original value of `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `power` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9)**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n_cases` remains an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` remains 2, the original value of `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `power` is equal to `n`, and `stdin` still contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9).
