The code prints the result of the expression `2 ** power`, where `power` is equal to the current value of `n`. Since the current value of `power` is equal to the current value of `n`, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), the printed value will be 2 raised to the power of `n`.

Output: **2^n (where n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, inclusive)**
