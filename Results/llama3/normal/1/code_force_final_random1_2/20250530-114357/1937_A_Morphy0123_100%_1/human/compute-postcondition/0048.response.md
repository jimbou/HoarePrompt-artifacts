Output: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), stdin contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9). If `n` is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `power` is either equal to `n` or `n-1`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is updated to its base-2 logarithm, `power` is either equal to `n` or decreased by 1, and 2 raised to the power of either `n` or `power` is being printed, depending on whether `power` is equal to `n` or not, and 1 is printed**
