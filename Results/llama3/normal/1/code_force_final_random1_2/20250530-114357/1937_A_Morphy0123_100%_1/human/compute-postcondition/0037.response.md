The code prints the result of the expression `2 ** power`. To determine the value of `power`, we need to understand the initial state of the program.

The initial state describes `n_cases` as an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `i` as 1. However, these variables are not directly related to the value of `power`.

The initial state also describes `n` as the base-2 logarithm of its original value. This means that `n` is the exponent to which 2 must be raised to obtain the original value.

The initial state also mentions that `power` is equal to `n`. This means that `power` is also the base-2 logarithm of the original value.

Finally, the initial state describes the current value of `power` as equal to the current value of `n`. This means that the value of `power` is the same as the value of `n`, which is the base-2 logarithm of the original value.

Therefore, the expression `2 ** power` is equivalent to `2 ** n`, where `n` is the base-2 logarithm of the original value.

Since the exact original value is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `2 ** power`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of raising 2 to the power of the base-2 logarithm of the original value.

Output: **2 raised to the power of the base-2 logarithm of the original value**
