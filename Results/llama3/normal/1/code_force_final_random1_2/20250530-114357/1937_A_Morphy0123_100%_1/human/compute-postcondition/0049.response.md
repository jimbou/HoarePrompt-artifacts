Output State: **n_cases is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, n is the base-2 logarithm of its original value, power is 1, stdin contains n_cases - 5 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9). If the original value of n is 1, the number 1 is being printed. If the original value of n is greater than or equal to 2, 2 raised to the power of either n or power is being printed, depending on whether power is equal to n or not.**
