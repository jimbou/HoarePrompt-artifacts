The code prints the result of the expression `2 ** power`. The value of `power` is not explicitly given, but it is described as being decreased by 1 from its original value, which is not equal to `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `power` is decreased by 1, `power` can be any integer between 2 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive).

Output: **2 raised to the power of an integer between 2 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive)**
