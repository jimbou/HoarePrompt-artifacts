Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, the original value of `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 3, `stdin` contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), `n` is greater than 2**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `n_cases` is still between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is still 2, the original value of `n` is still greater than 2, and `stdin` still contains `n_cases - 5` lines, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^9), with `n` being greater than 2.
